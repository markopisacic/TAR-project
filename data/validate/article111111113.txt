Kate 0
Steinle's 0
death 0
at 0
the 0
hands 0
of 0
a 0
Mexican 0
national 0
became 0
a 0
flashpoint 0
in 0
the 0
immigration 0
debate 0
— 0
here's 0
the 0
story 0
behind 0
her 0
killing 0

The 0
surprise 0
acquittal 0
of 0
Jose 0
Ines 0
Garcia 0
Zarate 0
in 0
the 0
shooting 0
death 0
of 0
San 0
Francisco 0
woman 0
Kate 0
Steinle 0
set 0
off 0
a 0
firestorm 1
of 1
outrage 1
Thursday 0
night, 0
as 0
top 0
conservatives 0
and 0
critics 0
of 0
so-called 0
"sanctuary 0
cities" 0
pinned 1
blame 1
for 1
Steinle's 1
death 1
on 1
illegal 1
immigration 1
and 1
insufficiently 1
aggressive 1
deportation 1
policies. 1

Garcia 0

Zarate, 0
a 0
45-year-old 0
Mexican 0
national 0
who 0
was 0
homeless 0
and 0
living 0
in 0
the 0
US 0
illegally 0
when 0
he 0
fired 0
the 0
shot 0
that 0
killed 0
Steinle, 0
was 0
acquitted 0
by 0
a 0
jury 0
on 0
murder 0
and 0
manslaughter 0
charges. 0

The 0
jury 0
convicted 0
him 0
of 0
the 0
lesser 0
charge 0
of 0
being 0
a 0
felon 0
in 0
possession 0
of 0
a 0
gun, 0
which 0
carries 0
a 0
maximum 0
sentence 0
of 0
three 0
years 0
in 0
state 0
prison. 0

Steinle, 0

32, 0
was 0
fatally 0
shot 0
while 0
she 0
walked 0
along 0
Pier 0
14 0
of 0
the 0
San 0
Francisco 0
Bay 0
with 0
her 0
father 0
in 0
July 0
2015. 0

The 0
bullet 0
that 0
pierced 0
her 0
back 0
had 0
ricocheted 0
off 0
the 0
concrete 0
ground 0
after 0
it 0
was 0
fired 0
by 0
Garcia 0
Zarate 0
from 0
a 0
handgun 0
belonging 0
to 0
a 0
federal 0
ranger 0
that 0
had 0
been 0
stolen 0
four 0
days 0
earlier. 0

Garcia 0

Zarate's 0
defense 0
attorneys 0
argued 0
that 0
the 0
shooting 0
was 0
an 0
accident 0
— 0
they 0
said 0
he 0
found 0
the 0
gun 0
wrapped 0
in 0
a 0
T-shirt 0
or 0
cloth 0
under 0
a 0
pier 0
bench 0
and 0
unintentionally 0
discharged 0
it. 0

Lead 0
attorney 0
Matt 0
Gonzalez 0
has 0
argued 0
that 0
the 0
weapon 0
was 0
a 0
SIG 0
Sauer 0
with 0
a 0
"hair 1
trigger 1
in 1
single-action 1
mode" 1
— 0
a 0
model 0
well-known 0
for 0
accidental 0
discharges 0
even 0
among 0
experienced 0
shooters. 0

Gonzalez 0
told 0
the 0
jury, 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
San 0
Francisco 0
Chronicle, 0
that 0
Garcia 0
Zarate 0
had 0
never 0
handled 0
a 0
firearm 0
before, 0
was 0
frightened 0
by 0
the 0
noise 0
of 0
the 0
gunshot, 0
then 0
flung 0
the 0
weapon 0
into 0
the 0
bay 0
where 0
it 0
was 0
later 0
found 0
by 0
a 0
diver. 0

Prosecutors, 0

however, 0
alleged 0
that 0
Garcia 0
Zarate 0
brought 0
the 0
weapon 0
to 0
the 0
pier 0
deliberately 0
to 0
do 0
harm, 0
and 0
intentionally 0
aimed 0
and 0
shot 0
Steinle 0
after 0
firmly 0
pulling 0
the 0
trigger. 0

They 0
said 0
Garcia 0
Zarate 0
then 0
threw 0
the 0
weapon 0
into 0
the 0
bay 0
and 0
fled 0
the 0
scene. 0

Beyond 0

the 0
shooting 0
itself, 0
perhaps 0
the 0
most 0
controversial 0
aspect 0
of 0
Garcia 0
Zarate's 0
case 0
involves 0
his 0
previous 0
criminal 0
activity 0
and 0
history 0
of 0
deportations, 0
and 0
how 0
San 0
Francisco 0
and 0
federal 0
authorities 0
handled 0
his 0
custody 0
before 0
he 0
ever 0
picked 0
up 0
the 0
gun 0
and 0
shot 0
Steinle. 0

At 0
the 0
time 0
of 0
Steinle's 0
death, 0
Garcia 0
Zarate 0
had 0
been 0
convicted 0
of 0
nonviolent 0
drug 0
crimes 0
and 0
deported 0
five 0
times 0
since 0
the 0
early 0
1990s. 0

He 0

faced 0
a 0
sixth 0
deportation 0
in 0
2015, 0
and 0
was 0
in 0
Justice 0
Department 0
(DOJ) 0
custody 0
that 0
March 0
after 0
serving 0
46 0
months 0
in 0
prison 0
for 0
a 0
felony 0
re-entry 0
into 0
the 0
US, 0
but 0
instead 0
of 0
transferring 0
him 0
into 0
the 0
custody 0
of 0
Immigration 0
and 0
Customs 0
Enforcement 0
(ICE) 0
for 0
deportation, 0
the 0
department 0
transferred 0
him 0
to 0
the 0
San 0
Francisco 0
County 0
Jail 0
for 0
prosecution 0
of 0
a 0
1995 0
marijuana 0
charge. 0

San 0

Francisco 0
prosecutors, 0
who 0
had 0
long 0
ago 0
deprioritized 0
marijuana 0
charges, 0
dismissed 0
the 0
decades-old 0
charge 0
and 0
released 0
Garcia 0
Zarate 0
on 0
April 0
15, 0
2015. 0

Due 0
to 0
San 0
Francisco's 0
policy 0
of 0
limiting 0
cooperation 0
with 0
federal 0
immigration 0
authorities 0
— 0
which 0
some 0
refer 0
to 0
as 0
a 0
"sanctuary" 1
policy 1
— 0
the 0
city 0
did 0
not 0
inform 0
ICE 0
when 0
they 0
released 0
Garcia 0
Zarate. 0

As 0

a 0
result 0
of 0
the 0
case, 0
both 0
the 0
DOJ 0
and 0
the 0
city 0
of 0
San 0
Francisco 0
have 0
changed 0
several 0
policies. 0

The 0
DOJ 0
announced 0
in 0
2016 0
it 0
would 0
no 0
longer 0
release 0
potentially 0
deportable 0
detainees 0
to 0
local 0
jails 0
without 0
first 0
allowing 0
ICE 0
to 0
take 0
custody. 0

San 0
Francisco, 0
meanwhile, 0
has 0
adjusted 0
its 0
policy 0
to 0
notify 0
ICE 0
if 0
they 0
are 0
releasing 0
suspected 0
undocumented 0
immigrants 0
who 0
face 0
charges 0
of 0
serious 0
or 0
violent 0
felonies. 0

"This 1

tragedy 1
could 1
have 1
been 1
prevented 1
if 1
San 1
Francisco 1
had 1
simply 1
turned 1
the 1
alien 1
over 1
to 1
ICE 1
as 1
we 1
requested, 1
instead 1
of 1
releasing 1
him 1
back 1
onto 1
the 1
streets," 1
ICE 0
Director 0
Thomas 0
Homan 0
said 0
in 0
a 0
statement 0
on 0
Thursday. 0

"It 0
is 0
unconscionable 0
that 0
politicians 1
across 1
this 1
country 1
continue 1
to 1
endanger 1
the 1
lives 1
of 1
Americans 1
with 1
sanctuary 1
policies 1
while 1
ignoring 1
the 1
harm 1
inflicted 1
on 1
their 1
constituents." 1

But 0

ICE 0
has 0
faced 0
criticism 0
of 0
its 0
own 0
over 0
not 0
seeking 0
a 0
judicial 0
warrant 0
to 0
legally 0
obtain 0
custody 0
of 0
Garcia 0
Zarate 0
when 0
it 0
discovered 0
he 0
had 0
been 0
transferred 0
into 0
San 0
Francisco's 0
custody. 0

The 0
agency 0
has 0
argued 0
that 0
obtaining 0
judicial 0
warrants 0
are 0
unnecessary 0
and 0
would 0
place 0
too 0
much 0
burden 0
on 0
ICE 0
officials 0
and 0
federal 0
courts. 0

Though 0

the 0
agency 0
did 0
issue 0
a 0
request 0
to 0
the 0
city 0
to 0
detain 0
Garcia 0
Zarate 0
until 0
ICE 0
officials 0
could 0
pick 0
him 0
up, 0
their 0
detainer 0
requests 0
are 0
not 0
signed 0
by 0
a 0
judge 0
and 0
are 0
therefore 0
not 0
legally 0
binding. 0

San 0
Francisco's 0
policy 0
is 0
to 0
ignore 0
such 0
requests 0
if 0
they 0
are 0
not 0
accompanied 0
by 0
judge-signed 0
warrants, 0
and 0
the 0
city 0
has 0
cited 0
federal 0
court 0
cases 0
concluding 0
that 0
such 0
detentions 0
violate 0
inmates' 0
Fourth 0
Amendment 0
rights. 0

Garcia 0

Zarate's 0
deportation 0
and 0
criminal 0
history 0
made 0
him 0
an 0
effective 0
target 0
for 0
immigration 0
hardliners, 0
who 0
argued 0
that 0
Steinle 1
would 1
still 1
be 1
alive 1
were 1
it 1
not 1
for 1
an 1
insecure 1
border 1
and 1
lenient 1
treatment 1
toward 1
suspected 1
undocumented 1
immigrants 1
in 1
local 1
jails. 1

President 0
Donald 0
Trump 0
immediately 0
seized 0
on 0
the 0
verdict 0
on 0
Thursday 0
as 0
evidence 0
of 0
the 0
perils 0
of 0
"Illegal 0
Immigration." 0

Trump 0
frequently 0
villainized 0
Garcia 0
Zarate 0
and 0
cited 0
Steinle's 0
death 0
during 0
his 0
presidential 0
campaign, 0
using 0
the 0
case 0
to 0
bolster 0
his 0
argument 0
for 0
a 0
border 0
wall 0
and 0
aid 0
his 0
crusade 0
against 0
"sanctuary 0
cities." 0

Early 0

on 0
Friday, 0
Trump 0
also 0
falsely 0
claimed 0
on 0
Twitter 0
that 0
Garcia 0
Zarate 0
had 0
previously 0
committed 0
violent 0
crimes 0
and 0
had 0
illegally 0
entered 0
the 0
US 0
six 0
times 0
due 0
to 0
lax 0
border 0
security 0
under 0
the 0
Obama 0
administration. 0

"The 1

Kate 1
Steinle 1
killer 1
came 0
back 0
and 0
back 0
over 0
the 0
weakly 0
protected 0
Obama 0
border, 0
always 0
committing 0
crimes 0
and 0
being 0
violent, 0
and 0
yet 0
this 0
info 0
was 0
not 0
used 0
in 0
court. 0

His 0
exoneration 0
is 0
a 1
complete 1
travesty 1
of 1
justice. 1

BUILD 1
THE 1
WALL!" 1

Trump 0
tweeted. 0

In 0

fact, 0
Garcia 0
Zarate 0
had 0
never 0
been 0
convicted 0
of 0
a 0
violent 0
crime 0
before 0
Steinle's 0
shooting 0
— 0
his 0
previous 0
convictions 0
were 0
for 0
nonviolent 0
drug 0
crimes 0
and 0
illegal 0
entry. 0

Lax 0
border 0
security, 0
too, 0
does 0
not 0
appear 0
to 0
be 0
a 0
factor 0
since 0
Garcia 0
Zarate 0
was 0
caught 0
by 0
border 0
patrol 0
agents 0
each 0
time 0
he 0
entered 0
the 0
country 0
under 0
the 0
Obama 0
administration. 0

In 0

contrast, 0
Steinle's 0
family 0
has 0
expressed 0
nuanced 0
views 0
on 0
immigration 0
and 0
"sanctuary" 0
policies. 0

They 0
have 0
both 0
condemned 0
Trump 0
for 0
"sensationalizing" 0
Steinle's 0
death 0
to 0
advance 0
anti-immigration 0
policies, 0
and 0
expressed 0
frustration 0
with 0
San 0
Francisco 0
officials, 0
who 0
they 0
believe 0
went 0
too 0
far 0
in 0
refusing 0
to 0
cooperate 0
with 0
federal 0
immigration 0
authorities. 0
