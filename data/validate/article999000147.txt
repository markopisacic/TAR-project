The 1
Senate's 1
own 1
rules 1
prohibit 1
this 1
kind 1
of 1
behavior, 1
but 1
will 1
the 1
Senate 1
hold 1
these 1
women 1
to 1
the 1
standard 1
they've 1
set? 1

“This 1
is 1
a 1
clear 1
violation 1
of 1
the 1
Senate 1
Ethics 1
rules 1
which 1
safeguard 1
against 1
the 1

the 0
only 0
thing 0
that 0

here 0
is 0
censure, 0
and 0
that 0
is 0
highly 0

in 0
the 0
