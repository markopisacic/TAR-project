did 0 316 2
not 0 316 2

public 0 316 2
because 0 316 2

said 0 316 15
he 0 316 15
thought 0 316 15
the 0 316 15
photograph 0 316 15

it 0 316 15

someone 1 316 15
might 1 316 15
“break 1 316 15

“that 0 316 15
Watergate 0 316 15
crap.” 1 316 15
He 0 316 15
said 0 316 15
he 0 316 15
“felt 0 316 15
a 0 316 15
little 0 316 15
bit 0 316 15
more 0 316 15
at 0 316 15

after 0 316 15
Farrakhan 0 316 15

showing 0 316 17
him 0 316 17

I 0 316 17
was 0 316 17
going 0 316 17
to 0 316 17

Muhammad 0 316 17
said. 0 316 17

“He 0 316 18
had 0 316 18
no 0 316 18
objection.” 0 316 18
… 0 316 18
During 0 316 18
Obama’s 0 316 18
presidential 0 316 18
campaign, 0 316 18
conservatives 0 316 18
pushed 0 316 18
multiple 0 316 18
apparently 0 316 18
racially 0 316 18

conspiracy 0 316 18
theories 0 316 18
about 0 316 18
Obama’s 0 316 18

and 0 316 18
supposed 0 316 18
ties 0 316 18

For 0 316 19

in 0 316 19

black 0 316 20

Farrakhan’s 0 316 21
eventual 0 316 21
failure 0 316 21
suggests 0 316 21
to 0 316 21
Obama 0 316 21
that’s 0 316 21
there 0 316 21
is 0 316 21
more 0 316 21
economic 0 316 21
upside 0 316 21
for 0 316 21
blacks 0 316 21
in 0 316 21
shaking 1 316 21
down 1 316 21

than 0 316 21
in 0 316 21

During 0 316 22
the 0 316 22
2008 0 316 22
presidential 0 316 22
election, 0 316 22
conservatives 0 316 22
questioned 0 316 22
the 0 316 22
indirect 0 316 22
ties 0 316 22
between 0 316 22
Farrakhan 0 316 22
and 0 316 22
Obama, 0 316 22
who 0 316 22
attended 0 316 22
a 0 316 22
church 0 316 22
that 0 316 22
gave 0 316 22
Farrakhan 0 316 22
an 0 316 22
award. 0 316 22

Obama’s 0 316 23
“spiritual 1 316 23
advisor” 1 316 23
Rev. 0 316 23

Jeremiah 0 316 24
Wright 0 316 24
gave 0 316 24
Farrakhan 0 316 24
his 0 316 24
church’s 0 316 24
Lifetime 0 316 24
Achievement 0 316 24
award 0 316 24
in 0 316 24
a 0 316 24
downtown 0 316 24

Regency 0 316 24
in 0 316 24
November 0 316 24
2007, 0 316 24
but 0 316 24
the 0 316 24
story 0 316 24
didn’t 0 316 24
make 0 316 24
the 0 316 24
press 0 316 24
until 0 316 24
the 0 316 24
following 0 316 24
year. 0 316 24

Similarly, 0 316 25
very 0 316 25
little 0 316 25
media 0 316 25
attention 0 316 25
was 0 316 25
paid 0 316 25
to 0 316 25
the 0 316 25
close 0 316 25
relationship 0 316 25
between 0 316 25
Obama’s 0 316 25
fundraiser 0 316 25
and 0 316 25
private 0 316 25
mentor 0 316 25
Tony 0 316 25
Rezko 0 316 25
and 0 316 25
the 0 316 25
Nation 0 316 25
of 0 316 25
Islam, 0 316 25
even 0 316 25
though 0 316 25
Rezko’s 0 316 25
role 0 316 25
was 0 316 25
business 0 316 25
manager 0 316 25
for 0 316 25
Nation 0 316 25
of 0 316 25
Islam 0 316 25
assets, 0 316 25
such 0 316 25
as 0 316 25
the 0 316 25
career 0 316 25
of 0 316 25
Muhammad 0 316 25
Ali. 0 316 25

But 0 316 26
after 0 316 26
all, 0 316 26
what 0 316 26
could 0 316 26
be 0 316 26
more 0 316 26
boring 0 316 26
than 0 316 26
a 0 316 26
story 0 316 26
than 0 316 26
involves 0 316 26
a 0 316 26
Presidential 0 316 26
candidate, 0 316 26
the 0 316 26
Syrian 0 316 26

most 0 316 26
famous 0 316 26

Reading 1 316 27
Obama’s 1 316 27
1995 1 316 27
memoir, 1 316 27
you 1 316 27
might 1 316 27
almost 1 316 27
get 1 316 27
the 1 316 27
impression 1 316 27
that 1 316 27
after 1 316 27
a 1 316 27
prudent 1 316 27
first 1 316 27
term, 1 316 27
during 1 316 27
