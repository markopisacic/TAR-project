Again: 0 350 0
Biggest 0 350 0
Threat 0 350 0
Isn't 0 350 0
"White 0 350 0
Men" 0 350 0
- 0 350 0

Domestic 0 350 0

Are 0 350 0
These 0 350 0
People 0 350 0

“So, 0 350 1
we 0 350 1
have 0 350 1
to 0 350 1
stop 0 350 1
demonizing 1 350 1
people 1 350 1
and 0 350 1
realize 0 350 1
the 1 350 1
biggest 1 350 1
terror 1 350 1
threat 1 350 1
in 1 350 1
this 1 350 1
country 1 350 1
is 1 350 1
white 1 350 1
men, 1 350 1
most 0 350 1
of 0 350 1
them 0 350 1
radicalized 0 350 1
to 0 350 1
the 0 350 1
right. 0 350 1

And 0 350 2
we 0 350 2
have 0 350 2
to 0 350 2
start 0 350 2
doing 0 350 2
something 0 350 2
about 0 350 2
them. 0 350 2

There 0 350 3
is 0 350 3
no 0 350 3
travel 0 350 3
ban 0 350 3
on 0 350 3
them. 0 350 3

There 0 350 4
is 0 350 4
no 0 350 4
ban 0 350 4
on 0 350 4
— 0 350 4
they 0 350 4
had 0 350 4
the 0 350 4
Muslim 0 350 4
ban. 0 350 4

There 0 350 5
is 0 350 5
no 0 350 5
white 0 350 5
guy 0 350 5
ban. 0 350 5

So, 0 350 6
what 0 350 6
do 0 350 6
we 0 350 6
do 0 350 6
about 0 350 6
that?” 0 350 6

Just 0 350 7
to 0 350 7
illustrate 0 350 7
the 1 350 7
absurdity 1 350 7
of 0 350 7
Don 0 350 7
Lemon’s 0 350 7
comments, 0 350 7
I 0 350 7
thought 1 350 7
it 1 350 7
would 1 350 7
be 1 350 7
fun 1 350 7
to 0 350 7
go 0 350 7
look 0 350 7
at 0 350 7
the 0 350 7
current 0 350 7
list 0 350 7
of 0 350 7
the 0 350 7
FBI’s 0 350 7
most 0 350 7
wanted 0 350 7
terrorists. 0 350 7

Below 0 350 8
is 0 350 8
the 0 350 8
list 0 350 8
of 0 350 8
“domestic” 0 350 8
terrorists 0 350 8
and, 0 350 8
regardless 0 350 8
of 0 350 8
the 0 350 8
list/filter 0 350 8
you 0 350 8
choose, 0 350 8
you 0 350 8
won’t 0 350 8
find 0 350 8
many 0 350 8
“white 1 350 8
men”. 1 350 8

Interestingly 0 350 9
enough, 0 350 9
it 0 350 9
looks 0 350 9
like 0 350 9
the 0 350 9
WOMEN 0 350 9
in 0 350 9
this 0 350 9
country 0 350 9
are 0 350 9
currently 0 350 9
responsible 0 350 9
for 0 350 9
more 0 350 9
terrorism 0 350 9
than 0 350 9
