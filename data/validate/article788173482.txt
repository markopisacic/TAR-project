yesterday, 0 52 2
the 0 52 2

as 1 52 2
a 1 52 2
“hoax.” 1 52 2
Exposing 0 52 2
it 0 52 2

one 1 52 2

“crowning 1 52 2

of 1 52 2
his 1 52 2

he 0 52 2
said. 0 52 2

“What 1 52 3
we’ve 1 52 3
done 1 52 3
is 1 52 3
a 1 52 3
great 1 52 3

to 1 52 3
the 1 52 3

he 0 52 3
said. 0 52 3

“I 0 52 4

in 0 52 4
its 0 52 4
own 0 52 4

this 1 52 4
might 1 52 4

the 1 52 4

because 0 52 4
this 0 52 4

“They 0 52 6

in 1 52 6
the 1 52 6

of 1 52 6
our 1 52 6
country 1 52 6
because 0 52 6
basically 0 52 6
what 0 52 6
they 0 52 6
did 0 52 6
is, 0 52 6
they 0 52 6

think 0 52 6
he’s 0 52 6
been 0 52 6
treated 0 52 6
very 0 52 6

Although 1 52 11
the 1 52 11
conspiracy 1 52 11

is 1 52 11

it 1 52 11
continues 1 52 11
to 1 52 11

When 0 52 12

fought 0 52 12
back, 0 52 12

them. 0 52 12

This 0 52 13

won’t 0 52 13

may. 1 52 16

it 0 52 18
was 0 52 18
established 0 52 18
