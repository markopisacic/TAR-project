For 0 65 4
Erdogan, 0 65 4
the 0 65 4

the 0 65 4
major 0 65 4
U.S. 0 65 4

in 0 65 4
Syria, 0 65 4
is 0 65 4
an 0 65 4

of 0 65 4
the 0 65 4
Kurdish 0 65 4
PKK 0 65 4

Turkey, 0 65 4
which 0 65 4
we 0 65 4
and 0 65 4
the 0 65 4
Turks 0 65 4
have 0 65 4
designated 0 65 4
as 0 65 4
a 0 65 4
terrorist 0 65 4
organization. 0 65 4

While 0 65 5
the 0 65 5

our 0 65 5
most 0 65 5
effective 0 65 5
allies 0 65 5
against 0 65 5
ISIS 0 65 5
in 0 65 5
Syria, 0 65 5
Turkey 0 65 5
views 0 65 5
them 0 65 5

If 1 65 6
Erdogan 1 65 6

a 1 65 6
clash 1 65 6

Now 0 65 11
that 0 65 11

is 0 65 13
now 0 65 13
open-ended. 0 65 13

Our 0 65 14
goals: 0 65 14
Guarantee 0 65 14
al-Qaida 0 65 14
and 0 65 14
ISIS 0 65 14
do 0 65 14
not 0 65 14
return 0 65 14
and 0 65 14
set 0 65 14
up 0 65 14

Assad's 0 65 14

regime. 0 65 14

But 1 65 15
who 1 65 15
authorized 1 65 15
this 1 65 15
strategic 1 65 15
commitment, 1 65 15
of 0 65 15
indefinite 0 65 15
duration, 0 65 15
in 0 65 15
Syria, 0 65 15
when 0 65 15

again, 0 65 16
the 0 65 16
American 0 65 16

the 0 65 19

them 0 65 19
as 0 65 19
terrorists? 0 65 19

Are 1 65 20
we 1 65 20
prepared 1 65 20
for 1 65 20
a 1 65 20

The 0 65 21
U.S. 0 65 21

in 0 65 21
Syria 0 65 21
said 0 65 21
this 0 65 21

Remarkable: 0 65 22
A 0 65 22
U.S.-created 0 65 22

Iraq, 0 65 22
over 0 65 22
Syria's 0 65 22
objections. 0 65 22

And 0 65 23
the 0 65 23
U.S. 0 65 23
military 0 65 23
will 0 65 23
stand 0 65 23
behind 0 65 23

Are 1 65 24
the 1 65 24
2,000 1 65 24
U.S. 1 65 24
troops 1 65 24
in 1 65 24
Syria 1 65 24
really 1 65 24
up 1 65 24
to 1 65 24
that 1 65 24
task, 1 65 24
should 0 65 24
the 0 65 24
Turks 0 65 24

Syrian 0 65 24

Who 0 65 25
sanctioned 0 65 25
this 0 65 25
commitment 0 65 25
to 0 65 25
a 0 65 25
new 0 65 25

do 0 65 25
not 0 65 25
all 0 65 25
back 0 65 25
down, 0 65 25
risks 1 65 25
a 1 65 25

no 1 65 25

the 1 65 25
Kurds? 1 65 25

As 0 65 26
for 0 65 26
Syria's 0 65 26
Kurds 0 65 26
casting 0 65 26
their 0 65 26
lot 0 65 26
with 0 65 26
the 0 65 26
Americans, 0 65 26
one 0 65 26
wonders: 0 65 26
Did 0 65 26
they 0 65 26
not 0 65 26
observe 0 65 26
what 0 65 26
happened 0 65 26
when 0 65 26
their 0 65 26
Iraqi 0 65 26
cousins, 0 65 26
after 0 65 26
helping 0 65 26
us 0 65 26
drive 0 65 26
ISIS 0 65 26
out 0 65 26
of 0 65 26
Mosul, 0 65 26
were 0 65 26
themselves 0 65 26
driven 0 65 26
out 0 65 26
of 0 65 26
Kirkuk 0 65 26
by 0 65 26
the 0 65 26
Iraqi 0 65 26
army, 0 65 26
as 0 65 26
their 0 65 26
U.S. 0 65 26
allies 0 65 26
watched? 0 65 26

In 0 65 27
the 0 65 27
six-year 0 65 27
Syrian 0 65 27
civil 0 65 27
war, 0 65 27
which 0 65 27
may 0 65 27
be 0 65 27
about 0 65 27
to 0 65 27
enter 0 65 27
a 0 65 27
new 0 65 27
phase, 0 65 27
America 0 65 27
faces 0 65 27
a 0 65 27
familiar 0 65 27
situation. 0 65 27

While 0 65 28
our 0 65 28
"allies" 0 65 28
and 0 65 28
adversaries 0 65 28
have 0 65 28
vital 0 65 28
interests 0 65 28
there, 0 65 28
we 0 65 28
do 0 65 28
not. 0 65 28

The 0 65 29
Assads 0 65 29
have 0 65 29
been 0 65 29
in 0 65 29
power 0 65 29
for 0 65 29
the 0 65 29
lifetime 0 65 29
of 0 65 29
most 0 65 29
Americans. 0 65 29

And 0 65 30
we 0 65 30
Americans 0 65 30
have 0 65 30
never 0 65 30
shown 0 65 30
a 0 65 30
desire 0 65 30
to 0 65 30
fight 0 65 30
there. 0 65 30

Assad 0 65 31
has 0 65 31
a 0 65 31
vital 0 65 31
interest: 0 65 31
preservation 0 65 31
of 0 65 31
his 0 65 31
family 0 65 31
regime 0 65 31
and 0 65 31
the 0 65 31
reunification 0 65 31
of 0 65 31
his 0 65 31
country. 0 65 31

The 0 65 32
Turks 0 65 32
have 0 65 32
a 0 65 32
vital 0 65 32
interest 0 65 32
in 0 65 32
keeping 0 65 32
armed 0 65 32
Kurds 0 65 32
out 0 65 32
of 0 65 32

to 0 65 32
their 0 65 32

minority, 0 65 32
which 0 65 32
seeks 0 65 32
greater 0 65 32
independence. 0 65 32

The 0 65 33
