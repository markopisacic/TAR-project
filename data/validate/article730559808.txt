Dear 0
Cardinal 0
Marx 0
and 0
dear 0
Bishop 0
Bode, 0
there 1
is 1
only 1
one 1
Catholic 1
answer: 1
No! 1

And 0
your 1
addition 1
“in 1
individual 1
cases” 1
is 1
absolutely 1
worthless, 1
it 1
has 1
no 1
argumentative 1
force. 1

A 0
clear 0
statement 0
by 0
Bishop 0
Andreas 0
Laun 0
for 0
Kath.net. 0

Cardinal 0
Marx 0
and 0
also 0
Bishop 0
Bode 0
have 0
now 0
opened 0
up 0
to 0
the 0
idea 0
to 0
offer 0
homosexual 0
couples 0
a 0
blessing. 0

Why 1
not, 1
one 1
could 1
say, 1
since 1
the 1
Church 1
is 1
ready 1
to 1
bless 1
nearly 1
everything 1
on 1
the 1
earth? 1

Now, 0
the 0
Church 0
especially 0
blesses 0
people, 0
but 0
also 0
deeds 0
and 0
objects. 0

The 0
Jesuit 0
Father 0
Eckhard 0
Bieger 0
writes 0
in 0
the 0
Internet 0
about 0
Catholic 0
blessings: 0

For 0
Catholics, 0
really 0
everything 0
can 0
be 0
blessed, 0
not 0
only 0
places 0
of 0
worship, 0
chalices, 0
and 0
the 0
faithful 0
after 0
each 0
prayer 0
service 0
– 0
whether 0
after 0
a 0
Mass, 0
or 0
after 0
the 0
prayers 0
for 0
the 0
hours 0
of 0
the 0
day. 0

The 0
blessing 0
is 0
also 0
not 0
limited 0
to 0
rosaries 0
or 0
religious 0
medal, 0
but 0
one 0
may 0
also 0
bless 0
cars, 0
factory 0
halls, 0
animals, 0
herbs, 0
and 0
much 0
more. 0

Some 0
blessings 0
are 0
only 0
to 0
be 0
made 0
by 0
priests 0
and 0
deacons, 0
especially 0
when 0
it 0
is 0
about 0
objects 0
of 0
worship 0
such 0
as 0
chalices 0
or 0
vestments. 0

But 0
parents 0
can 0
bless 0
their 0
children. 0

The 0
faithful 0
may 0
also 0
take 0
home 0
holy 0
water 0
and 0
sprinkle 0
it 0
on 0
members 0
of 0
the 0
family, 0
but 0
also 0
the 0
stable 0
and 0
the 0
animals, 0
thus 0
blessing 0
them. 0

[...] 0

What 0
kind 0
of 0
hope 0
is 0
connected 0
with 0
a 0
blessing? 0

With 0
regard 0
to 0
the 0
car, 0
certainly 0
the 0
wish 0
for 0
heavenly 0
protection 0
– 0
sometimes 0
also 0
expressed 0
with 0
the 0
help 0
of 0
a 0
medal 0
of 0
St. 0
Christopher, 0
the 0
patron 0
saint 0
of 0
car 0
drivers. 0

With 0
the 0
weather 0
blessing, 0
one 0
prays 0
explicitly 0
for 0
protection 0
against 0
hail, 0
lightning 0
and 0
drought. 0

[…] 0

To 1
bless 1
always 1
means 1
that 1
something 1
shall 1
flourish, 1
because 1
only 1
then 1
when 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
blessing 1
upon 1
a 1
cause 1
or 1
a 1
project, 1
will 1
something 1
good 1
come 1
out 1
of 1
it. 1

The 0
blessing 0
comes 0
from 0
God, 0
He 0
is 0
being 0
addressed 0
in 0
the 0
form 0
of 0
a 0
request; 0
and 0
it 0
is 0
given 0
to 0
people, 0
objects, 0
and 0
buildings, 0
with 0
the 0
help 0
of 0
the 0
sign 0
of 0
the 0
cross, 0
holy 0
water, 0
and 0
incense. 0

[…] 0

But 0
now 0
concerning 0
the 0
question 0
of 0
Cardinal 0
Marx, 0
and 0
not 0
a 0
few 0
of 0
the 0
priests, 0
the 0
answer 0
is 0
simple: 0
one 0
may 0
ask 0
for 0
God's 0
blessing 0
for 0
sinners, 0
but 0
not 0
for 0
the 0
sin. 0

That 1
is 1
to 1
say, 1
one 1
could 1
not 1
consecrate 1
a 1
brothel, 1
one 1
could 1
not 1
bless 1
a 1
concentration 1
camp 1
or 1
weapons 1
which 1
are 1
not 1
explicitly 1
ordained 1
for 1
hunting 1
or 1
for 1
legitimate 1
self-defense. 1

Therefore 0
it 0
is 0
clear 0
that 0
one 1
may 1
not 1
bless 1
a 1
relationship 1
which 1
is 1
sinful; 1
[one 1
may 1
not 1
bless] 1
the 1
mafia; 1
no 1
blessing 1
for 1
organizations 1
or 1
institutions 1
which 1
promote 1
or 1
procure 1
abortions 1
or 1
which 1
propagate 1
ideologies 1
which 1
are 1
against 1
the 1
Faith, 1
antisemitic 1
contents, 1
or 1
other 1
forms 1
of 1
racist 1
thought. 1

If 1
one 1
considers 1
and 1
weighs 1
this 1
matter, 1
one 1
knows: 1
one 1
may 1
not 1
bless 1
a 1
union 1
of 1
two 1
homosexual 1
men 1
or 1
of 1
lesbian 1
women. 1

Of 0
course 0
[one 0
could 0
bless] 0
two 0
men 0
or 0
women 0
who 0
are 0
de 0
facto 0
homosexual, 0
and 0
that 0
it 0
what 0
happens 0
in 0
each 0
Holy 0
Mass 0
which 0
is 0
being 0
attended 0
by 0
them. 0

This 0
blessing 0
– 0
which 0
is 0
not 0
related 0
to 0
their 0
acts 0
– 0
is 0
being 0
received 0
also 0
by 0
all 0
the 0
other 0
sinners, 0
and 0
the 0
Church 0
thereby 0
hopes 0
that 0
they 0
will 0
convert 0
under 0
the 0
influence 0
of 0
God's 0
Grace! 0

This 1
position 1
which 1
is 1
really 1
simple 1
and 1
easily 1
to 1
be 1
understood 1
has 0
been 0
clearly 0
and 0
convincingly 0
presented 0
– 0
since 0
the 0
statement 0
of 0
the 0
two 0
bishops 0
[Marx 0
and 0
Bode] 0
– 0
by 0
several 0
Christians: 0
by 0
Archbishops 0
Ludwig 0
Schick 0
(Germany) 0
and 0
Charles 0
Chaput 0
(USA); 0
by 0
the 0
German-speaking 0
theologians 0
Hubert 0
Windisch 0
and 0
Markus 0
Büning. 0

I 1
am 1
sure 1
there 1
are 1
many 1
many 1
others, 1
too, 1
who 1
think 1
alike, 1
but 1
whom 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
know. 1

Dear 1
Cardinal 1
Marx 1
and 1
dear 1
Bishop 1
Bode, 1
there 1
is 1
only 1
one 1
Catholic 1
answer: 1
No! 1

And 1
your 1
addition 1
“in 1
individual 1
cases” 1
is 1
absolutely 1
worthless, 1
it 1
has 1
no 1
argumentative 1
force. 1

What 0
would 0
St. 0
John 0
the 0
Baptist 0
have 0
said 0
if 0
Herod, 0
taking 0
for 0
himself 0
his 0
brother's 0
wife, 0
would 0
have 0
excusingly 0
called 0
himself 0
an 0
“individual 0
case”! 0

The 0
idea 0
to 0
bless 0
sinful 0
conduct 0
is 0
really 0
what 0
Isaiah 0
described 0
quite 0
vividly, 0
as 0
follows: 0
“Woe 0
to 0
you 0
that 0
call 0
evil 0
good, 0
and 0
good 0
evil: 0
that 0
put 0
darkness 0
for 0
light, 0
and 0
light 0
for 0
darkness: 0
that 0
put 0
bitter 0
for 0
sweet, 0
and 0
sweet 0
for 0
bitter.” 0
[Isaiah 0
5:20] 0

Is 0
this 0
not 0
exactly 0
what 0
Cardinal 0
Marx 0
– 0
and 0
others 0
who 0
are 0
thinking 0
like 0
him 0
– 0
are 0
doing? 0

If 0
one 0
were 0
to 0
place 0
on 0
a 0
bottle 0
of 0
sour 0
cucumbers 0
a 0
tag 0
“honey,” 0
the 0
cucumbers 0
still 0
remain 0
sour! 0

Even 0
blessing 0
bishops 0
cannot 0
change 0
that. 0

Nor 0
can 0
the 0
pope, 0
in 0
calling 0
for 0
a 0
cultural 0
revolution, 0
especially 0
since 0
he 0
does 0
not 0
explain 0
what 0
he 0
exactly 0
means 0
by 0
it. 0

He 0
says 0
that 0
he 0
“allows 0
himself” 0
to 0
talk 0
like 0
that 0
– 0
but 1
if 1
one 1
dares 1
something, 1
one 1
might 1
win, 1
but 1
one 1
also 1
can 1
perish. 1

That 0
seems 0
to 0
catch 0
on 0
these 0
days. 0

For 0
example, 0
the 0
Italian 0
moral 0
theologian, 0
Maurizio 0
Chiodi, 0
recently 0
claimed 0
in 0
his 0
talk 0
at 0
the 0
Gregorian 0
Pontifical 0
University 0
that 0
contraception 0
is 0
sometimes 0
not 0
only 0
not 0
forbidden, 0
but 0
even 0
demanded! 0

To 1
contradict 1
two 1
popes 1
– 1
whom 1
the 1
Church 1
has 1
already 1
“beatified” 1
the 1
one 1
and 1
“canonized” 1
the 1
other 1
– 1
so 1
shortly 1
after 1
their 1
deaths, 1
and 1
in 1
such 1
a 1
radical 1
and 1
open 1
manner, 1
probably 1
has 1
never 1
happened 1
before 1
in 1
the 1
Church's 1
history. 1

Isaiah 1
says 1
that 1
such 1
people 1
draw 1
unto 1
them 1
God's 1
punishment, 1
with 1
thick 1
cords! 1

Nevertheless, 0
one 0
should 0
wish 0
for 0
Cardinal 0
Marx, 0
Bishop 0
Bode, 0
and 0
Professor 0
Chiodi 0
that 0
they 0
sleep 0
well. 0

Whether 0
their 0
conscience 0
will 0
allow 0
it, 0
is 0
not 0
so 0
certain; 0
but 0
if 0
it 0
does 0
not 0
[allow 0
it], 0
it 0
would 0
certainly 0
be 0
a 0
hope 0
for 0
their 0
conversion. 0
