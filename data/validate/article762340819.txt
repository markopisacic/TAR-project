Even 1 254 0

Thought 0 254 0

The 0 254 1
Washington 0 254 1
Free 0 254 1
Beacon 0 254 1
reported 0 254 1
Wednesday 0 254 1
that 0 254 1
“the 0 254 1
Obama 0 254 1
administration 0 254 1
skirted 0 254 1

new 0 254 1

investigation.” 0 254 1

And 0 254 2
it 0 254 2
gets 0 254 2
even 1 254 2
worse: 1 254 2
“The 0 254 2
investigation, 0 254 2
published 0 254 2

This 0 254 3
revelation 0 254 3
comes 0 254 3
after 0 254 3
the 0 254 3
news 0 254 3
that 0 254 3
came 0 254 3
to 0 254 3
light 0 254 3
in 0 254 3
February, 0 254 3
that, 0 254 3
according 0 254 3
to 0 254 3
Bill 0 254 3
Gertz 0 254 3

“the 0 254 3

There 0 254 4
is 0 254 4
a 0 254 4
law 0 254 4
that 0 254 4
applies 0 254 4

U.S. 0 254 5
Code 0 254 5

In 0 254 6
a 0 254 6
sane 0 254 6
political 0 254 6
environment, 0 254 6
Barack 0 254 6
Obama 0 254 6
would 0 254 6
be 0 254 6
tried 0 254 6
for 0 254 6
treason. 1 254 6

Barack 0 254 7
Hussein 0 254 7
Obama 0 254 7
has 0 254 7
planted 0 254 7
seeds 0 254 7
that 0 254 7
will 0 254 7
be 0 254 7

bitter 0 254 7

probably 1 254 7
decades, 1 254 7
to 0 254 7

He 0 254 8
is, 0 254 8
without 0 254 8
any 0 254 8
doubt, 0 254 8
the 1 254 8
worst 1 254 8
President 0 254 8
in 0 254 8
American 0 254 8
history. 0 254 8

Fillmore, 0 254 9
Pierce, 0 254 9
Buchanan? 0 254 9

Yes, 0 254 10
the 0 254 10
doughface 0 254 10
Presidents 0 254 10
made 0 254 10
the 0 254 10
Civil 0 254 10
War 0 254 10
inevitable, 0 254 10
but 0 254 10
worse 0 254 10
came 0 254 10
later. 0 254 10

Grant? 0 254 11

Blind 1 254 12
to 1 254 12
corruption 1 254 12
and 0 254 12
out 0 254 12
of 0 254 12
his 0 254 12
depth, 0 254 12
but 0 254 12
there 0 254 12
have 0 254 12
been 0 254 12
worse 0 254 12
than 0 254 12
he 0 254 12
as 0 254 12
well. 0 254 12

Wilson? 0 254 13

That 0 254 14
black-hearted 1 254 14
Presbyterian 1 254 14
bigot 1 254 14
arguably 0 254 14
gave 0 254 14
the 0 254 14

Hitler 0 254 14
and 0 254 14
World 0 254 14
War 0 254 14
II, 0 254 14
so 0 254 14
he 0 254 14
is 0 254 14
definitely 0 254 14
in 0 254 14
the 0 254 14
Final 0 254 14
Four. 0 254 14

Harding? 0 254 15

Nah: 0 254 16
his 0 254 16
tax 0 254 16
cuts 0 254 16
and 0 254 16
return 0 254 16
to 0 254 16
“normalcy” 0 254 16
got 0 254 16
the 0 254 16
American 0 254 16
economy, 0 254 16
and 0 254 16
the 0 254 16
Twenties, 0 254 16
roaring. 0 254 16

FDR 0 254 17
and 0 254 17
LBJ 0 254 17
gave 0 254 17
us 0 254 17
the 0 254 17
modern 0 254 17
welfare 0 254 17
state 0 254 17
and 0 254 17
dependent 0 254 17
classes 0 254 17
automatically 0 254 17
voting 0 254 17
Democrat; 0 254 17
the 0 254 17
full 0 254 17
bill 0 254 17
on 0 254 17
the 0 254 17
damage 0 254 17
they 0 254 17
did 0 254 17
hasn’t 0 254 17
yet 0 254 17
been 0 254 17
presented. 0 254 17

Nixon? 0 254 18

A 0 254 19
crook 1 254 19
and 1 254 19
an 1 254 19
economic 1 254 19
Leftist, 1 254 19
who 0 254 19
betrayed 0 254 19
Taiwan 0 254 19
for 0 254 19
the 0 254 19
People’s 0 254 19
Republic; 0 254 19
his 0 254 19
record 0 254 19
certainly 0 254 19
isn’t 0 254 19
good. 0 254 19

Carter? 0 254 20

Nothing 1 254 21
good 1 254 21
can 0 254 21
be 0 254 21
said 0 254 21
about 0 254 21
his 0 254 21
four 0 254 21
years 0 254 21
of 0 254 21
sanctimony 0 254 21
and 0 254 21
incompetence. 0 254 21

But 0 254 22
there 0 254 22
is 0 254 22
one 0 254 22
thing 0 254 22
Barack 0 254 22
Obama 0 254 22
has 0 254 22
on 0 254 22
all 0 254 22
competitors: 0 254 22
treason. 1 254 22

He 0 254 23
showered 0 254 23
hundreds 0 254 23
of 0 254 23
billions 0 254 23
of 0 254 23
dollars 0 254 23
on 0 254 23
the 0 254 23
Islamic 0 254 23
Republic 0 254 23
of 0 254 23
Iran. 0 254 23

There 0 254 24
are 0 254 24
those 0 254 24
who 0 254 24
say, 0 254 24
“It 0 254 24
was 0 254 24
their 0 254 24
money. 0 254 24

It 0 254 25
belonged 0 254 25
to 0 254 25
the 0 254 25
Iranian 0 254 25
government 0 254 25
but 0 254 25
was 0 254 25
frozen 0 254 25
and 0 254 25
not 0 254 25
paid 0 254 25
since 0 254 25
1979.” 0 254 25
Indeed, 0 254 25
and 0 254 25
there 0 254 25
was 0 254 25
a 0 254 25
reason 0 254 25
for 0 254 25
that: 0 254 25
not 0 254 25
even 0 254 25
Jimmy 0 254 25
Carter, 0 254 25
who 0 254 25
made 0 254 25
the 0 254 25
Islamic 0 254 25
Republic 0 254 25
of 0 254 25
Iran 0 254 25
possible, 0 254 25
thought 0 254 25
that 0 254 25
money, 0 254 25
which 0 254 25
had 0 254 25
been 0 254 25
paid 0 254 25
by 0 254 25
the 0 254 25
Shah’s 0 254 25
government 0 254 25
in 0 254 25
a 0 254 25
canceled 0 254 25
arms 0 254 25
deal, 0 254 25
belonged 0 254 25
to 0 254 25
the 0 254 25
mullahs 0 254 25
who 0 254 25
overthrew 0 254 25
the 0 254 25
Shah. 0 254 25

Likewise 0 254 26
Reagan, 0 254 26
George 0 254 26
H. 0 254 26
W. 0 254 26
Bush, 0 254 26
Clinton, 0 254 26
and 0 254 26
George 0 254 26
W. 0 254 26
Bush 0 254 26
all 0 254 26
thought 0 254 26
that 0 254 26
the 0 254 26
Islamic 0 254 26
Republic 0 254 26
was 0 254 26
not 0 254 26
due 0 254 26
money 0 254 26
that 0 254 26
was 0 254 26
owed 0 254 26
to 0 254 26
the 0 254 26
Shah. 0 254 26

Only 0 254 27
Barack 0 254 27
Obama 0 254 27
did. 0 254 27

The 0 254 28
definition 0 254 28
of 0 254 28
treason 1 254 28
is 0 254 28
giving 0 254 28
aid 0 254 28
and 0 254 28
comfort 0 254 28
to 0 254 28
the 0 254 28
enemy. 0 254 28

The 0 254 29
leaders 0 254 29
of 0 254 29
the 0 254 29
Islamic 0 254 29
Republic 0 254 29
of 0 254 29
Iran 0 254 29
order 0 254 29
their 0 254 29
people 0 254 29
to 0 254 29
chant 0 254 29
“Death 1 254 29
to 1 254 29
America” 1 254 29
in 0 254 29
mosques 0 254 29
every 0 254 29
Friday, 0 254 29
and 0 254 29
repeatedly 0 254 29
vow 0 254 29
that 0 254 29
they 0 254 29
will 0 254 29
ultimately 0 254 29
destroy 0 254 29
the 0 254 29
United 0 254 29
States 0 254 29
of 0 254 29
America 0 254 29
and 0 254 29
the 0 254 29
state 0 254 29
of 0 254 29
Israel. 0 254 29

How 0 254 30
was 0 254 30
giving 0 254 30
them 0 254 30
billions 0 254 30
and 0 254 30
helping 0 254 30
them 0 254 30
skirt 0 254 30
sanctions 0 254 30
applied 0 254 30
by 0 254 30
the 0 254 30
U.S. 0 254 30
government 0 254 30
not 0 254 30
treason? 1 254 30

Other 0 254 31
Presidents 0 254 31
have 0 254 31
been 0 254 31
incompetent, 1 254 31
corrupt, 1 254 31
dishonest, 1 254 31
but 0 254 31
which 0 254 31
has 0 254 31
committed 0 254 31
treason 1 254 31
on 0 254 31
a 0 254 31
scale 0 254 31
to 0 254 31
rival 0 254 31
the 0 254 31
treason 1 254 31
of 0 254 31
Barack 0 254 31
Obama? 0 254 31

The 0 254 32
Iranians 0 254 32
also 0 254 32
operate 0 254 32
a 0 254 32
global 0 254 32
network 0 254 32
of 0 254 32
jihad 0 254 32
terror 0 254 32
organizations, 0 254 32
one 0 254 32
of 0 254 32
which, 0 254 32
Hizballah, 0 254 32
is 0 254 32
quite 0 254 32
active 0 254 32
in 0 254 32
Mexico 0 254 32
now, 0 254 32
with 0 254 32
the 0 254 32
obvious 0 254 32
ultimate 0 254 32
intention 0 254 32
of 0 254 32
crossing 0 254 32
the 0 254 32
border 0 254 32
and 0 254 32
committing 1 254 32
jihad 1 254 32
massacres 1 254 32
of 1 254 32
Americans. 1 254 32

Obama 0 254 33
has 0 254 33
given 0 254 33
a 0 254 33
tremendous 1 254 33
boost 0 254 33
to 0 254 33
these 0 254 33
initiatives, 0 254 33
as 0 254 33
well 0 254 33
as 0 254 33
to 0 254 33
Iran’s 0 254 33
nuclear 0 254 33
program, 0 254 33
with 0 254 33
his 0 254 33
nuclear 0 254 33
deal 0 254 33
that 0 254 33
has 0 254 33
given 0 254 33
the 0 254 33
Iranians 0 254 33
hundreds 0 254 33
of 0 254 33
billions 0 254 33
of 0 254 33
dollars 0 254 33
and 0 254 33
essentially 0 254 33
a 0 254 33
green 0 254 33
light 0 254 33
to 0 254 33
manufacture 0 254 33

in 0 254 33
exchange 0 254 33
for 0 254 33
absolutely 0 254 33
nothing. 0 254 33

There 0 254 34
is 0 254 34
no 0 254 34
