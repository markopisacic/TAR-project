on 0

of 0
the 0
Hammonds, 0
thank 0
you! 0

It 0
should 0
be 0
noted 0
that 0
the 0
protests 0
that 0
took 0
place 0
in 0
Oregon 0
a 0
couple 0
of 0
years 0
ago 0
were 0
a 0
response 0
to 0
the 0
injustice 1
the 0
Hammonds 0
faced. 0

As 0
a 0
result, 0
Robert 0
"LaVoy" 0
Finicum 0
was 0
killed 0
by 0
Oregon 0
State 0
Police. 0

Those 0
who 0
led 0
the 0
protest 0
were 0
all 0

all 0
charges 0
and 0
reporter 0
Pete 0
Santilli 0
had 0
all 0
of 0
his 0
charges 0
dismissed. 0

No 0
doubt, 0
Finicum 0
would 0
have 0
been 0
found 0
not 0
guilty 0
as 0
well, 0
but 0
that's 0
not 0
how 0
tyrants 1
work, 0
is 0
it? 0

Today 0
is 0
a 0
day 0
to 0
celebrate 0
a 0
wrong 0
that 0

not 0
been 0
fully 0
