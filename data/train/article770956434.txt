At 0 288 17
the 0 288 17
Hammonds’ 0 288 17
original 0 288 17
sentencing, 0 288 17
the 0 288 17
judge 0 288 17
noted 0 288 17
that 0 288 17
they 0 288 17
are 0 288 17
respected 0 288 17
in 0 288 17
the 0 288 17
community 0 288 17
and 0 288 17
that 0 288 17
imposing 0 288 17
the 0 288 17
mandatory 0 288 17
minimum, 0 288 17
5-year 0 288 17
prison 0 288 17
sentence 0 288 17
would 0 288 17
“shock 1 288 17
the 1 288 17
conscience” 1 288 17
and 0 288 17
be 0 288 17
“grossly 1 288 17
disproportionate 1 288 17
to 1 288 17
the 1 288 17
severity” 1 288 17
of 0 288 17
their 0 288 17
conduct. 0 288 17

As 0 288 18
a 0 288 18
result, 0 288 18
the 0 288 18
judge 0 288 18
imposed 0 288 18
significantly 0 288 18
lesser 0 288 18
sentences. 0 288 18

The 0 288 19
previous 0 288 19
administration, 0 288 19
however, 0 288 19
filed 0 288 19
an 0 288 19
overzealous 1 288 19
appeal 0 288 19
that 0 288 19
resulted 0 288 19
in 0 288 19
the 0 288 19
Hammonds 0 288 19
being 0 288 19
sentenced 0 288 19
to 0 288 19
five 0 288 19
years 0 288 19
in 0 288 19
prison. 0 288 19

This 0 288 20
was 0 288 20
unjust. 1 288 20

Hammond 0 288 21
is 0 288 21
now 0 288 21

They 0 288 23

paid 0 288 23
$400,000 0 288 23

Hammonds 0 288 24
are 0 288 24
devoted 1 288 24
family 1 288 24

across 0 288 24
the 0 288 24

Justice 0 288 25
is 0 288 25
overdue 0 288 25
for 0 288 25
Dwight 0 288 25
and 0 288 25
Steven 0 288 25
Hammond, 0 288 25
both 0 288 25

these 0 288 25
Grants 0 288 25

Well, 0 288 26
it 0 288 26
took 0 288 26
long 0 288 26
enough, 0 288 26
but 0 288 26
thank 0 288 26
you 0 288 26
President 0 288 26
Trump. 0 288 26

You 0 288 27
did 0 288 27
the 0 288 27
right 0 288 27
thing 0 288 27
in 0 288 27
this 0 288 27
matter. 0 288 27

And 0 288 28
for 0 288 28
all 0 288 28
those 0 288 28
who 0 288 28
took 0 288 28
the 0 288 28
time 0 288 28
to 0 288 28
keep 0 288 28
this 0 288 28
story 0 288 28
alive 0 288 28
and 0 288 28
urge 0 288 28
people 0 288 28
to 0 288 28
petition 0 288 28
the 0 288 28
White 0 288 28
House 0 288 28
on 0 288 28
behalf 0 288 28
of 0 288 28
the 0 288 28
Hammonds, 0 288 28
thank 0 288 28
you! 0 288 28

It 0 288 29
should 0 288 29
be 0 288 29
noted 0 288 29
that 0 288 29
the 0 288 29
protests 0 288 29
that 0 288 29
took 0 288 29
place 0 288 29
in 0 288 29
Oregon 0 288 29
a 0 288 29
couple 0 288 29
of 0 288 29
years 0 288 29
ago 0 288 29
were 0 288 29
a 0 288 29
response 0 288 29
to 0 288 29
the 0 288 29
injustice 1 288 29
the 0 288 29
Hammonds 0 288 29
faced. 0 288 29

As 0 288 30
a 0 288 30
result, 0 288 30
Robert 0 288 30
"LaVoy" 0 288 30
Finicum 0 288 30
was 0 288 30
killed 0 288 30
by 0 288 30
Oregon 0 288 30
State 0 288 30
Police. 0 288 30

Those 0 288 31
who 0 288 31
led 0 288 31
the 0 288 31
protest 0 288 31
were 0 288 31
all 0 288 31
acquitted 0 288 31
of 0 288 31
all 0 288 31
charges 0 288 31
and 0 288 31
reporter 0 288 31
Pete 0 288 31
Santilli 0 288 31
had 0 288 31
all 0 288 31
of 0 288 31
his 0 288 31
charges 0 288 31
dismissed. 0 288 31

No 0 288 32
doubt, 0 288 32
Finicum 0 288 32
would 0 288 32
have 0 288 32
been 0 288 32
found 0 288 32
not 0 288 32
guilty 0 288 32
as 0 288 32
well, 0 288 32
but 0 288 32
that's 0 288 32
not 0 288 32
how 0 288 32
tyrants 1 288 32
work, 0 288 32
is 0 288 32
it? 0 288 32

Today 0 288 33
is 0 288 33
a 0 288 33
day 0 288 33
to 0 288 33
celebrate 0 288 33
a 0 288 33
wrong 0 288 33
that 0 288 33
has 0 288 33
not 0 288 33
been 0 288 33
fully 0 288 33
made 0 288 33
right, 0 288 33
but 0 288 33
