Gloria 0
Borger 0

“You 0
know–how 0
do 0
you 0
manage 0
that 0
politically? 0

I 0

we 0

jump 1
the 1
gun 1
here. 0

We 0
have 0
to 0
see 0
what 0
comes 0
out 0
from 0
Barr, 0
and 0
what’s 0
in 0
the 0
report. 0

But 0
if 0
I’m 0
at 0
Mar-A-Lago 0
with 0
the 0
president, 0
as 0
Pamela 0
has 0
been 0
reporting, 0
the 0

… 0
that 0
I 0
would 0
be 0
very 0
happy,” 0
she 0
added. 0

fact 0
a 0
“huge 0

couple 0
of 0

said. 0

“The 0
president 0
did 0
not 0
have 0
to 0
sit 0
down 0
for 0
an 0
interview. 0

They 1
were 1
so 1
concerned 1
about 1
that, 1
because 1
he’d 1
get 1
caught 1
up 1
in 1
lies–and 1
there’d 1
be 1
perjury 1
traps. 1

Okay, 0
