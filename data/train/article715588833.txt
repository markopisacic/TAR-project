then 0 105 7
indeed? 0 105 7

The 1 105 8
Dictator 1 105 8
Pope 1 105 8
even 0 105 8
feels 0 105 8
at 0 105 8
liberty 0 105 8
to 0 105 8
demand 0 105 8
that 0 105 8

God’s 0 105 8
words: 0 105 8
“And 0 105 8

which 0 105 8
Francis 0 105 8
has 0 105 8
decided, 0 105 8
after 0 105 8
2,000 0 105 8

a 0 105 8
“not 0 105 8
a 0 105 8

translation.” 0 105 8
Apparently 0 105 8
lost 0 105 8
on 0 105 8
Francis, 0 105 8
given 1 105 8
the 1 105 8
disordered 1 105 8

has 1 105 8
read 1 105 8
that 1 105 8
constitutes 1 105 8
his 1 105 8
theology, 1 105 8
is 0 105 8
the 0 105 8
distinction 0 105 8
between 0 105 8
sin, 0 105 8
a 0 105 8
culpable 0 105 8
act, 0 105 8
and 0 105 8
temptation, 0 105 8
which 0 105 8
arises 0 105 8
from 0 105 8
concupiscence 0 105 8
or 0 105 8
what 0 105 8
Saint 0 105 8
Thomas 0 105 8
called 0 105 8
the 0 105 8
fomes, 0 105 8
or 0 105 8
the 0 105 8
fleshly 0 105 8
inclination 0 105 8
to 0 105 8
sin, 0 105 8
which 0 105 8
grace 0 105 8
enables 0 105 8
us 0 105 8
to 0 105 8
control 0 105 8
by 0 105 8
the 0 105 8
rule 0 105 8
of 0 105 8
reason 0 105 8
over 0 105 8
the 0 105 8
passions. 0 105 8

But 0 105 9
now 0 105 9
we 0 105 9
are 0 105 9
witness 0 105 9
to 0 105 9

single 1 105 9
worst 1 105 9
act 1 105 9

the 0 105 9
entire 0 105 9
history 0 105 9
of 0 105 9

papacy. 0 105 9

The 0 105 10
Church 0 105 10
has 0 105 10
seen 0 105 10
a 0 105 10
number 0 105 10
of 0 105 10
Popes 0 105 10
who 0 105 10
have 0 105 10
abused 0 105 10
their 0 105 10
power, 0 105 10
Alexander 0 105 10
VI 0 105 10
being 0 105 10
the 0 105 10
most 0 105 10
popularly 0 105 10
known 0 105 10
example. 0 105 10

But 1 105 11
never, 1 105 11
before 1 105 11

there 1 105 11
been 1 105 11

to 1 105 11
tyrannize 1 105 11
the 1 105 11
Magisterium 1 105 11
itself 1 105 11
by 1 105 11
attempting 1 105 11
to 1 105 11
bend 1 105 11
it 1 105 11
to 1 105 11
his 1 105 11
errant 1 105 11
personal 1 105 11
opinions. 1 105 11

officially 0 105 12

which 0 105 12
he 0 105 12
expressly 0 105 12
approved 0 105 12
in 0 105 12
his 0 105 12

as 0 105 12
the 0 105 12
only 0 105 12
correct 0 105 12
interpretation 0 105 12

The 0 105 13
guidelines 0 105 13

private 0 105 13
missive, 0 105 13
which 0 105 13
is 0 105 13
suddenly 0 105 13
declared 0 105 13
to 0 105 13
be 0 105 13
“an 0 105 13
apostolic 0 105 13
letter.” 0 105 13

The 0 105 14
normalist 0 105 14
narrative 0 105 14
has 0 105 14
just 0 105 14
been 0 105 14
stripped 0 105 14
of 0 105 14
any 0 105 14
colorable 0 105 14
argument 0 105 14
that 0 105 14
nothing 0 105 14
is 0 105 14
too 0 105 14
terribly 0 105 14
amiss 0 105 14
with 0 105 14
this 0 105 14
pontificate. 0 105 14

We 0 105 15
are 0 105 15
now 0 105 15
expected 0 105 15
to 0 105 15
believe 0 105 15
that 0 105 15
the 0 105 15
“authentic 0 105 15
Magisterium”—meaning 0 105 15
simply 0 105 15
and 0 105 15

what 0 105 15
the 0 105 15

When 0 105 16
the 0 105 16
concrete 0 105 16
circumstances 0 105 16
of 0 105 16
a 0 105 16
couple 0 105 16
make 0 105 16
it 0 105 16
feasible, 0 105 16
especially 0 105 16
when 0 105 16
both 0 105 16
are 0 105 16
Christians 0 105 16
with 0 105 16
a 0 105 16
journey 0 105 16
of 0 105 16
faith, 0 105 16
one 0 105 16
may 0 105 16
propose 0 105 16
that 0 105 16
they 0 105 16
commit 0 105 16
to 0 105 16
living 0 105 16
in 0 105 16
continence…. 0 105 16

In 0 105 17
other 0 105 17
more 0 105 17
complex 0 105 17
circumstances, 0 105 17
and 0 105 17
when 0 105 17
it 0 105 17
is 0 105 17
not 0 105 17
possible 0 105 17
to 0 105 17
obtain 0 105 17
a 0 105 17
declaration 0 105 17
of 0 105 17
nullity, 0 105 17
the 0 105 17
aforementioned 0 105 17

may 0 105 17
not, 0 105 17
in 0 105 17
fact, 0 105 17
be 0 105 17
viable. 0 105 17

Nonetheless, 0 105 18
it 0 105 18
is 0 105 18
equally 0 105 18
possible 0 105 18
to 0 105 18

a 0 105 18

of 0 105 18
discernment…. 0 105 18

[I]f 0 105 19
one 0 105 19
arrives 0 105 19
at 0 105 19
the 0 105 19
recognition 0 105 19
that, 0 105 19
in 0 105 19
a 0 105 19

there 0 105 19

Francis, 0 105 32
however, 0 105 32
has 0 105 32
purported 0 105 32
to 0 105 32
do 0 105 32
nothing 0 105 32

the 0 105 32
doctrine 0 105 32
of 0 105 32
the 0 105 32
Church. 0 105 32

The 0 105 33
attempt 0 105 33
is 0 105 33
void, 0 105 33
of 0 105 33
course, 0 105 33
and 0 105 33
the 0 105 33
appellation 0 105 33
“authentic 0 105 33
Magisterium” 0 105 33
is 0 105 33
fraudulent. 0 105 33

But 0 105 34
the 0 105 34
consequences 0 105 34
of 0 105 34
this 0 105 34
Pope’s 0 105 34
toying 1 105 34
with 1 105 34
the 1 105 34
teaching 1 105 34
office 1 105 34
of 0 105 34
the 0 105 34
Church 0 105 34
to 0 105 34
advance 0 105 34
half-baked 1 105 34
theological 1 105 34
notions, 1 105 34
such 0 105 34
as 0 105 34
“discernment” 0 105 34
(a 0 105 34

Loyola 0 105 34
but 0 105 34
strips 0 105 34
of 0 105 34
its 0 105 34
original 0 105 34
meaning) 0 105 34
are 0 105 34
catastrophic. 0 105 34

Over 0 105 35
the 0 105 35
past 0 105 35
year, 0 105 35
Cardinal 0 105 35
Burke 0 105 35

other 0 105 35
members 0 105 35
of 0 105 35
the 0 105 35
hierarchy 0 105 35
have 0 105 35
called 0 105 35
upon 0 105 35
Francis 0 105 35
to 0 105 35
“clarify” 0 105 35
his 0 105 35
intention 0 105 35
respecting 0 105 35
AL. 0 105 35

That 0 105 36
clarification 0 105 36
has 0 105 36
now 0 105 36
been 0 105 36
given: 0 105 36
Francis 0 105 36
intends, 0 105 36
if 0 105 36
it 0 105 36
were 0 105 36
possible, 0 105 36
to 0 105 36
change 0 105 36
the 0 105 36
unchangeable 0 105 36
teaching 0 105 36
of 0 105 36
the 0 105 36
Church 0 105 36
regarding 0 105 36
an 0 105 36
irrevocable 0 105 36
moral 0 105 36
norm 0 105 36
rooted 0 105 36
in 0 105 36
divine 0 105 36
law. 0 105 36

Even 1 105 37
if 1 105 37
the 1 105 37
attempt 1 105 37
is 1 105 37
void 1 105 37
and 1 105 37
of 1 105 37
no 1 105 37
effect 1 105 37
before 1 105 37
man 1 105 37
and 1 105 37
God—an 1 105 37
immoral 1 105 37
law 1 105 37
is 1 105 37
no 1 105 37
law 1 105 37
at 1 105 37
all—Francis 0 105 37
clearly 0 105 37
means 0 105 37
to 0 105 37
impose 0 105 37
his 0 105 37
will 0 105 37
by 0 105 37
fiat, 0 105 37
daring 0 105 37
invoke 0 105 37
the 0 105 37
“authentic 0 105 37
Magisterium” 0 105 37
to 0 105 37
cloak 1 105 37
his 1 105 37
absurd 1 105 37
novelties. 1 105 37

No 1 105 38
Pope 1 105 38
before 1 105 38
him 1 105 38
has 1 105 38
ever 1 105 38
dared 1 105 38
to 1 105 38
do 1 105 38
such 1 105 38
a 1 105 38
thing. 1 105 38

So 0 105 39
now 0 105 39
it 0 105 39
must 0 105 39
be 0 105 39
asked: 0 105 39
Where 0 105 39
are 0 105 39
the 0 105 39
cardinals 0 105 39
and 0 105 39
the 0 105 39
bishops? 0 105 39

With 0 105 40
one 0 105 40
or 0 105 40
two 0 105 40
noble 0 105 40
(however 0 105 40
inconsistent) 0 105 40
exceptions, 0 105 40
their 0 105 40
response 0 105 40
to 0 105 40
the 0 105 40
Bergoglian 0 105 40
Debacle 0 105 40
thus 0 105 40
far 0 105 40
ranges 0 105 40
from 0 105 40
silence, 0 105 40
to 0 105 40
active 0 105 40
complicity, 0 105 40
to—at 0 105 40
best—hand-wringing 0 105 40
over 0 105 40
the 0 105 40
increasingly 0 105 40
chaotic 0 105 40
state 0 105 40
of 0 105 40
the 0 105 40
Church 0 105 40
while 0 105 40
begging 0 105 40
the 0 105 40
Pope 0 105 40
to 0 105 40
“clarify” 0 105 40
his 0 105 40
already 0 105 40
perfectly 0 105 40
clear 0 105 40
intentions. 0 105 40

At 0 105 41
this 0 105 41
point, 0 105 41
continued 0 105 41
pleading 0 105 41
for 0 105 41
a 0 105 41
Bergoglian 0 105 41
“clarification” 0 105 41
can 0 105 41
only 0 105 41
give 0 105 41
rise 0 105 41
to 0 105 41
an 0 105 41
impression 0 105 41
of 0 105 41
disingenuousness, 0 105 41
whereas 0 105 41
continued 0 105 41
silence 0 105 41
about 0 105 41
the 0 105 41
papal 0 105 41
origin 0 105 41
of 0 105 41
this 0 105 41
ongoing 0 105 41
catastrophe 0 105 41
is 1 105 41
a 1 105 41
standing 1 105 41
rebuke 1 105 41
to 1 105 41
all 1 105 41
the 1 105 41
hierarchs 1 105 41
who 1 105 41
know 1 105 41
what 1 105 41
we 1 105 41
all 1 105 41
know: 1 105 41
that 1 105 41
at 1 105 41
the 1 105 41
epicenter 1 105 41
of 1 105 41
the 1 105 41
chaos 1 105 41
is 1 105 41
the 1 105 41
most 1 105 41
wayward 1 105 41
Pope 1 105 41
the 1 105 41
Church 1 105 41
has 1 105 41
ever 1 105 41
had 1 105 41
to 1 105 41
endure. 1 105 41

Continued 1 105 42
inaction 1 105 42
while 1 105 42
the 1 105 42
laity 1 105 42
and 1 105 42
a 1 105 42
few 1 105 42
good 1 105 42
priests 1 105 42
are 1 105 42
left 1 105 42
to 1 105 42
themselves 1 105 42
to 1 105 42
defend, 1 105 42
as 1 105 42
best 1 105 42
they 1 105 42
can, 1 105 42
the 1 105 42
constant 1 105 42
teaching 1 105 42
of 1 105 42
the 1 105 42
Church 1 105 42
against 1 105 42
the 1 105 42
abuses 1 105 42
of 1 105 42
a 1 105 42
tyrant 1 105 42
on 1 105 42
the 1 105 42
Chair 1 105 42
of 1 105 42
Peter 1 105 42
threatens 1 105 42
the 1 105 42
hierarchs 1 105 42
with 1 105 42
a 1 105 42
legacy 1 105 42
of 1 105 42
shame 1 105 42
and 1 105 42
a 1 105 42
terrible 1 105 42
accountability 1 105 42
before 1 105 42
the 1 105 42
Just 1 105 42
Judge. 1 105 42

Their 0 105 43
failure 0 105 43
to 0 105 43
defend 0 105 43
the 0 105 43
Faith 0 105 43
by 0 105 43
standing 0 105 43

the 0 105 43
one 0 105 43
they 0 105 43
know 0 105 43
full 0 105 43
well 0 105 43
is 0 105 43
attacking 0 105 43
it 0 105 43
almost 0 105 43
daily 0 105 43
lends 0 105 43
itself 0 105 43
ever 0 105 43
more 0 105 43
to 0 105 43
an 0 105 43
indictment 0 105 43
for 0 105 43
timidity 0 105 43
in 0 105 43
the 0 105 43
face 0 105 43
of 0 105 43
unprecedented 0 105 43
danger 0 105 43
to 0 105 43
the 0 105 43
Church 0 105 43
and 0 105 43
the 0 105 43
cause 0 105 43
of 0 105 43
the 0 105 43
Gospel 0 105 43
of 0 105 43
which 0 105 43
they 0 105 43
are 0 105 43
divinely 0 105 43
charged 0 105 43
to 0 105 43
be 0 105 43
leaders. 0 105 43

The 1 105 44
time 1 105 44
for 1 105 44
“prudence” 1 105 44
is 1 105 44
long 1 105 44
past. 1 105 44

Prudence 0 105 45
now 0 105 45
gives 0 105 45
way 0 105 45
to 0 105 45
mere 0 105 45
pusillanimity. 0 105 45

The 0 105 46
time 0 105 46
for 0 105 46
hierarchical 0 105 46
action 0 105 46
is 0 105 46
now, 0 105 46
before 0 105 46
the 0 105 46
damage 0 105 46
to 0 105 46
the 0 105 46
Church 0 105 46
becomes 0 105 46
irreparable. 0 105 46

The 0 105 47
members 0 105 47
of 0 105 47
a 0 105 47
hierarchy 0 105 47
seemingly 0 105 47
cowed 0 105 47
by 0 105 47
a 1 105 47
papal 1 105 47
tyranny 1 105 47
the 1 105 47
Church 1 105 47
has 1 105 47
never 1 105 47
before 1 105 47
seen 1 105 47
must 0 105 47
rise 0 105 47
immediately 0 105 47
and 0 105 47
give 0 105 47
a 0 105 47
courageous 0 105 47
answer 0 105 47
to 0 105 47
the 0 105 47
challenge 0 105 47
posed 0 105 47
long 0 105 47
ago 0 105 47
by 0 105 47
Monsignor 0 105 47
Klaus 0 105 47
Gamber, 0 105 47
when 0 105 47
an 0 105 47
already 0 105 47
monumental 0 105 47
ecclesial 0 105 47
crisis 0 105 47
was 0 105 47
still 0 105 47
in 0 105 47
what 0 105 47
can 0 105 47
now 0 105 47
can 0 105 47
be 0 105 47
seen 0 105 47
as 0 105 47
merely 0 105 47
a 0 105 47
preliminary 0 105 47
stage: 0 105 47

Where 0 105 48
in 0 105 48
our 0 105 48
Church 0 105 48
are 0 105 48
the 0 105 48
leaders 0 105 48
who 0 105 48
can 0 105 48
show 0 105 48
us 0 105 48
the 0 105 48
right 0 105 48
path? 0 105 48

Where 0 105 49
are 0 105 49
the 0 105 49
bishops 0 105 49
courageous 0 105 49
enough 0 105 49
to 1 105 49
cut 1 105 49
out 1 105 49
the 1 105 49
cancerous 1 105 49
growth 1 105 49
of 1 105 49
modernist 1 105 49
theology 1 105 49
that 1 105 49
has 1 105 49
implanted 1 105 49
itself 1 105 49
and 1 105 49
is 1 105 49
festering 1 105 49
within 1 105 49
the 1 105 49
celebration 1 105 49
of 1 105 49
even 1 105 49
the 1 105 49
most 1 105 49
sacred 1 105 49
mysteries, 1 105 49
before 1 105 49
the 1 105 49
cancer 1 105 49
spreads 1 105 49
and 1 105 49
causes 1 105 49
even 1 105 49
greater 1 105 49
damage? 1 105 49

What 0 105 50
we 0 105 50
need 0 105 50
today 0 105 50
is 0 105 50
a 0 105 50
new 0 105 50
Athanasius, 0 105 50
a 0 105 50
new 0 105 50
Basil, 0 105 50
bishops 0 105 50
like 0 105 50
those 0 105 50
who 0 105 50
in 0 105 50
the 0 105 50
fourth 0 105 50
century 0 105 50
fought 0 105 50
courageously 0 105 50
against 0 105 50
Arianism 0 105 50
when 0 105 50
almost 0 105 50
the 0 105 50
whole 0 105 50
of 0 105 50
Christendom 0 105 50
had 0 105 50
succumbed 0 105 50
to 0 105 50
heresy. 0 105 50

Will 0 105 51
none 0 105 51
of 0 105 51
the 0 105 51
hierarchs 0 105 51
rise 0 105 51
to 0 105 51
defend 0 105 51
the 0 105 51
Church 0 105 51
as 0 105 51
“a 0 105 51
new 0 105 51
Athanasius, 0 105 51
a 0 105 51
new 0 105 51
Basil”? 0 105 51

Even 0 105 52
the 0 105 52
best 0 105 52
among 0 105 52
them 0 105 52
continue 0 105 52
to 0 105 52
limit 0 105 52
themselves 0 105 52
to 0 105 52
generalized 0 105 52
lamentations 0 105 52
at 0 105 52
conferences 0 105 52
or 0 105 52
in 0 105 52
interviews 0 105 52
about 0 105 52
the 0 105 52
parlous 0 105 52
state 0 105 52
of 0 105 52
the 0 105 52
Church 0 105 52
or 0 105 52
at 0 105 52
most 0 105 52
the 0 105 52
“confusion” 0 105 52
Francis 0 105 52
has 0 105 52
caused 0 105 52
by 0 105 52
not 0 105 52
“clarifying” 0 105 52
precisely 0 105 52
what 0 105 52
he 0 105 52
has 0 105 52
just 0 105 52
clarified. 0 105 52

They 0 105 53
avoid 0 105 53
the 0 105 53
absolutely 0 105 53
necessary 0 105 53
direct 0 105 53
and 0 105 53
public 0 105 53
exposure 0 105 53
of 0 105 53
error 0 105 53
at 0 105 53
its 0 105 53
source. 0 105 53

That 1 105 54
error 1 105 54
threatens 1 105 54
to 1 105 54
overwhelm 1 105 54
the 1 105 54
Church 1 105 54
while 1 105 54
they 1 105 54
do 1 105 54
little 1 105 54
more 1 105 54
than 1 105 54
fret 1 105 54
about 1 105 54
a 1 105 54
situation 1 105 54
whose 1 105 54
self-evident 1 105 54
cause—a 1 105 54
reckless 1 105 54
Pope 1 105 54
in 1 105 54
love 1 105 54
with 1 105 54
his 1 105 54
own 1 105 54
ideas 1 105 54
and 1 105 54
filled 1 105 54
with 1 105 54
contempt 1 105 54
for 1 105 54
Tradition—they 1 105 54
seem 1 105 54
incapable 1 105 54
of 1 105 54
identifying. 1 105 54

Concerned 0 105 55
clergy 0 105 55
and 0 105 55
laity 0 105 55
throughout 0 105 55
the 0 105 55
Catholic 0 105 55
world 0 105 55
are 0 105 55
doing 0 105 55
what 0 105 55
they 0 105 55
can 0 105 55
according 0 105 55
to 0 105 55
their 0 105 55
stations. 0 105 55

But 0 105 56
in 0 105 56
the 0 105 56
midst 0 105 56
of 0 105 56
that 0 105 56
“final 0 105 56
battle” 0 105 56
over 0 105 56
marriage 0 105 56
and 0 105 56
family 0 105 56
of 0 105 56
which 0 105 56
Sister 0 105 56
Lucia 0 105 56
warned 0 105 56
the 0 105 56
late 0 105 56
Cardinal 0 105 56
Caffarra 0 105 56
in 0 105 56
light 0 105 56
of 0 105 56
the 0 105 56
Third 0 105 56
Secret 0 105 56
of 0 105 56
Fatima, 0 105 56
within 0 105 56
the 0 105 56
human 0 105 56
element 0 105 56
of 0 105 56
the 0 105 56
Church 0 105 56
only 0 105 56
the 0 105 56
cardinals 0 105 56
and 0 105 56
the 0 105 56
bishops 0 105 56
possess 0 105 56
the 1 105 56
divinely 1 105 56
bestowed 1 105 56
power 1 105 56
to 1 105 56
repel 1 105 56
an 1 105 56
assault 1 105 56
on 1 105 56
marriage, 1 105 56
family 1 105 56
and 1 105 56
the 1 105 56
very 1 105 56
integrity 1 105 56
of 1 105 56
the 1 105 56
Faith 1 105 56
that 1 105 56
is 1 105 56
now, 1 105 56
for 1 105 56
the 1 105 56
first 1 105 56
time 1 105 56
in 1 105 56
Church 1 105 56
history, 1 105 56
being 0 105 56
led 0 105 56
by 0 105 56
a 0 105 56
Roman 0 105 56
Pontiff. 0 105 56

This 0 105 57
undeniably 0 105 57
apocalyptic 0 105 57
development 0 105 57
imposes 0 105 57
upon 0 105 57
the 0 105 57
hierarchs—first 0 105 57
and 0 105 57
foremost 0 105 57
in 0 105 57
the 0 105 57
Church—the 0 105 57
duty 0 105 57
to 0 105 57
act. 0 105 57

True 1 105 58
love 1 105 58
for 1 105 58
the 1 105 58
Church, 1 105 58
indeed 1 105 58
true 1 105 58
charity 1 105 58
toward 1 105 58
Francis 1 105 58
himself, 1 105 58
requires 1 105 58
of 1 105 58
them 1 105 58
nothing 1 105 58
less 1 105 58
than 1 105 58
what 1 105 58
was 1 105 58
required 1 105 58
of 1 105 58
Saint 1 105 58
Paul 1 105 58
when 1 105 58
the 1 105 58
first 1 105 58
Pope 1 105 58
fell 1 105 58
into 1 105 58
error 1 105 58
that 1 105 58
jeopardized 1 105 58
the 1 105 58
very 1 105 58
mission 1 105 58
of 1 105 58
the 1 105 58
Church: 1 105 58
that 1 105 58
Peter 1 105 58
be 1 105 58
withstood 1 105 58
to 1 105 58
his 1 105 58
face 1 105 58
