has 0 12 1
his 0 12 1
press 0 12 1
pass 0 12 1
back. 0 12 1

The 0 12 2
Trump 0 12 2
administration 0 12 2
stood 0 12 2
down 0 12 2
on 0 12 2
Monday 0 12 2
from 0 12 2
its 0 12 2
nearly 0 12 2
two-week-long 0 12 2
dispute 0 12 2
with 0 12 2
CNN 0 12 2
over 0 12 2
the 0 12 2
White 0 12 2
House 0 12 2
credentials 0 12 2
of 0 12 2
Mr. 0 12 2
Acosta, 0 12 2
informing 0 12 2
the 0 12 2
correspondent 0 12 2
that 0 12 2
his 0 12 2
badge 0 12 2
was 0 12 2
formally 0 12 2
restored. 0 12 2

CNN 0 12 3
in 0 12 3
turn 0 12 3
dropped 0 12 3
its 0 12 3
lawsuit 0 12 3
on 0 12 3
the 0 12 3
matter, 0 12 3
which 0 12 3
had 0 12 3
ballooned 1 12 3
into 0 12 3
a 0 12 3
test 0 12 3
of 0 12 3
press 0 12 3
freedoms 0 12 3
in 0 12 3
the 0 12 3
Trump 0 12 3
era. 0 12 3

But 0 12 4
while 0 12 4
it 0 12 4
yielded 0 12 4
to 0 12 4
Mr. 0 12 4
Acosta 0 12 4
— 0 12 4
whose 0 12 4
testy 1 12 4
questions 0 12 4
had 0 12 4
touched 0 12 4
off 0 12 4
Mr. 0 12 4
Trump’s 0 12 4
ire 1 12 4
— 0 12 4
the 0 12 4
administration 0 12 4
used 0 12 4
the 0 12 4
occasion 0 12 4
to 0 12 4
lay 0 12 4
down 0 12 4
a 0 12 4
set 0 12 4
of 0 12 4
formal 0 12 4
rules 0 12 4
governing 0 12 4
reporters’ 0 12 4
behavior 0 12 4
at 0 12 4
future 0 12 4
White 0 12 4
House 0 12 4
news 0 12 4
conferences, 0 12 4
a 0 12 4
highly 0 12 4
unusual 0 12 4
step. 0 12 4

Among 0 12 5
the 0 12 5
guidelines 0 12 5
was 0 12 5
a 0 12 5
restriction 0 12 5
of 0 12 5
one 0 12 5
question 0 12 5
per 0 12 5
reporter, 0 12 5
with 0 12 5
follow-ups 0 12 5
allowed 0 12 5
at 0 12 5
the 0 12 5
discretion 0 12 5
of 0 12 5
the 0 12 5
president 0 12 5
or 0 12 5
the 0 12 5
White 0 12 5
House 0 12 5
official 0 12 5
at 0 12 5
the 0 12 5
lectern. 0 12 5

“Failure 0 12 6
to 0 12 6
abide,” 0 12 6
the 0 12 6
administration 0 12 6
warned, 0 12 6
“may 0 12 6
result 0 12 6
in 0 12 6
suspension 0 12 6
or 0 12 6
revocation 0 12 6
of 0 12 6
the 0 12 6
journalist’s 0 12 6
hard 0 12 6
pass.” 0 12 6

The 0 12 7
White 0 12 7
House 0 12 7
sought 0 12 7
to 0 12 7
blame 0 12 7
Mr. 0 12 7
Acosta 0 12 7
for 0 12 7
behaving 0 12 7
disrespectfully, 0 12 7
although 0 12 7
Mr. 0 12 7
Trump 0 12 7
often 0 12 7
lobs 0 12 7
insults 1 12 7
at 0 12 7
journalists 0 12 7
and 0 12 7
encourages 0 12 7
a 0 12 7
free-for-all 0 12 7
format 0 12 7
when 0 12 7
taking 0 12 7
questions 0 12 7
from 0 12 7
reporters. 0 12 7

Codifying 0 12 8
the 0 12 8
behavior 0 12 8
of 0 12 8
journalists 0 12 8
struck 0 12 8
some 0 12 8
as 0 12 8
an 0 12 8
ominous 1 12 8
encroachment 1 12 8
into 0 12 8
freedom 0 12 8
of 0 12 8
the 0 12 8
press, 0 12 8
and 0 12 8
the 0 12 8
White 0 12 8
House 0 12 8
Correspondents’ 0 12 8
Association 0 12 8
said 0 12 8
on 0 12 8
Monday 0 12 8
that 0 12 8
it 0 12 8
had 0 12 8
not 0 12 8
been 0 12 8
consulted 0 12 8
about 0 12 8
the 0 12 8
new 0 12 8
guidelines. 0 12 8

The 0 12 9
American 0 12 9
Civil 0 12 9
Liberties 0 12 9
Union, 0 12 9
in 0 12 9
a 0 12 9
statement, 0 12 9
said: 0 12 9
“These 0 12 9
rules 0 12 9
give 0 12 9
the 0 12 9
White 0 12 9
House 0 12 9
far 0 12 9
too 0 12 9
much 0 12 9
discretion 0 12 9
to 0 12 9
avoid 0 12 9
real 0 12 9
scrutiny. 0 12 9

The 0 12 10
White 0 12 10
House 0 12 10
belongs 0 12 10
to 0 12 10
the 0 12 10
public, 0 12 10
not 0 12 10
the 0 12 10
president, 0 12 10
and 0 12 10
the 0 12 10
job 0 12 10
of 0 12 10
the 0 12 10
press 0 12 10
is 0 12 10
to 0 12 10
ask 0 12 10
hard 0 12 10
questions, 0 12 10
not 0 12 10
to 0 12 10
be 0 12 10
polite 0 12 10
company.” 0 12 10

Still, 0 12 11
the 0 12 11
guidelines 0 12 11
are 0 12 11
not 0 12 11
far 0 12 11
removed 0 12 11
from 0 12 11
the 0 12 11
manner 0 12 11
in 0 12 11
which 0 12 11
White 0 12 11
House 0 12 11
news 0 12 11
conferences 0 12 11
typically 0 12 11
proceed. 0 12 11

Mr. 0 12 12
Trump 0 12 12
made 0 12 12
clear 0 12 12
last 0 12 12
week 0 12 12
that 0 12 12
he 0 12 12
would 0 12 12
introduce 0 12 12
“regulations” 0 12 12
after 0 12 12
a 0 12 12
federal 0 12 12
judge 0 12 12
criticized 0 12 12
the 0 12 12
White 0 12 12
House 0 12 12
for 0 12 12
stripping 0 12 12
Mr. 0 12 12
Acosta’s 0 12 12
credentials 0 12 12
without 0 12 12
due 0 12 12
process 0 12 12
or 0 12 12
a 0 12 12
coherent 0 12 12
rationale. 0 12 12

“We 0 12 13
would 0 12 13
have 0 12 13
greatly 0 12 13
preferred 0 12 13
to 0 12 13
continue 0 12 13
hosting 0 12 13
White 0 12 13
House 0 12 13
press 0 12 13
conferences 0 12 13
in 0 12 13
reliance 0 12 13
on 0 12 13
a 0 12 13
set 0 12 13
of 0 12 13
understood 0 12 13
professional 0 12 13
norms, 0 12 13
and 0 12 13
we 0 12 13
believe 0 12 13
the 0 12 13
overwhelming 0 12 13
majority 0 12 13
of 0 12 13
journalists 0 12 13
covering 0 12 13
the 0 12 13
White 0 12 13
House 0 12 13
share 0 12 13
that 0 12 13
preference,” 0 12 13
Sarah 0 12 13
Huckabee 0 12 13
Sanders, 0 12 13
the 0 12 13
press 0 12 13
secretary, 0 12 13
said 0 12 13
in 0 12 13
a 0 12 13
statement. 0 12 13

Press 0 12 14
relations 0 12 14
were 0 12 14
not 0 12 14
always 0 12 14
rosy 0 12 14
in 0 12 14
pre-Trump 0 12 14

days. 0 12 15
President 0 12 15
Barack 0 12 15
Obama’s 0 12 15
aides 0 12 15
preselected 0 12 15
the 0 12 15
news 0 12 15
outlets 0 12 15
that 0 12 15
were 0 12 15
allowed 0 12 15
to 0 12 15
ask 0 12 15
questions 0 12 15
at 0 12 15
his 0 12 15
news 0 12 15
conferences. 0 12 15

Mr. 0 12 16
Obama 0 12 16
often 0 12 16
chastised 0 12 16
reporters, 0 12 16
including 0 12 16
Mr. 0 12 16
Acosta 0 12 16
on 0 12 16
one 0 12 16
occasion, 0 12 16
for 0 12 16
questions 0 12 16
he 0 12 16
deemed 0 12 16
overly 1 12 16
aggressive 1 12 16
or 0 12 16
grandstanding. 1 12 16

But 0 12 17
Mr. 0 12 17
Trump, 0 12 17
a 0 12 17
devoted 1 12 17
news 1 12 17
consumer 1 12 17
who 0 12 17
relishes 0 12 17
his 0 12 17
coverage, 0 12 17
plays 0 12 17
up 0 12 17
his 0 12 17
conflicts 0 12 17
with 0 12 17
reporters 0 12 17
in 0 12 17
part 0 12 17
to 0 12 17
excite 0 12 17
his 0 12 17
supporters. 0 12 17

He 0 12 18
has 0 12 18
held 0 12 18
far 0 12 18
fewer 0 12 18
formal 0 12 18
news 0 12 18
conferences 0 12 18
than 0 12 18
his 0 12 18
predecessors, 0 12 18

the 0 12 18
daily 0 12 18
White 0 12 18
House 0 12 18
briefing 0 12 18
has 0 12 18
virtually 0 12 18
disappeared 0 12 18

his 0 12 18

Mr. 0 12 19
Acosta’s 0 12 19
White 0 12 19
House 0 12 19
badge 0 12 19
was 0 12 19
the 0 12 19
most 0 12 19
severe 1 12 19
step 0 12 19
yet, 0 12 19
and 0 12 19
it 0 12 19
soon 0 12 19
became 0 12 19
apparent 0 12 19
that 0 12 19
the 0 12 19
move 0 12 19
would 0 12 19
not 0 12 19
pass 0 12 19
legal 0 12 19
muster: 0 12 19
After 0 12 19
suing 0 12 19
last 0 12 19
week, 0 12 19
Mr. 0 12 19
Acosta 0 12 19
was 0 12 19
granted 0 12 19
the 0 12 19
temporary 0 12 19
return 0 12 19
of 0 12 19
his 0 12 19
credentials 0 12 19
by 0 12 19
a 0 12 19
federal 0 12 19

judge. 0 12 20
A 0 12 20
back-and-forth 0 12 20
ensued 0 12 20
over 0 12 20
the 0 12 20

weekend. 0 12 21
Bill 0 12 21

sent 0 12 21
a 0 12 21
letter 0 12 21
to 0 12 21
Mr. 0 12 21
Acosta 0 12 21
that 0 12 21
listed 0 12 21
several 0 12 21
reasons 0 12 21
that 0 12 21
his 0 12 21
pass 0 12 21
had 0 12 21
been 0 12 21
revoked, 0 12 21
perhaps 0 12 21
an 0 12 21
attempt 0 12 21
to 0 12 21
satisfy 0 12 21
the 0 12 21
judge’s 0 12 21
request 0 12 21
for 0 12 21
a 0 12 21
clear 0 12 21
rationale. 0 12 21

CNN’s 0 12 22
lawyers 0 12 22
called 0 12 22
the 0 12 22
note 0 12 22
an 0 12 22
“after-the-fact 0 12 22
concocted 0 12 22
process.” 0 12 22
By 0 12 22
Monday 0 12 22
afternoon, 0 12 22
the 0 12 22
sides 0 12 22
had 0 12 22

resolution. 0 12 22

Aides 0 12 23
to 0 12 23
Mr. 0 12 23
Trump 0 12 23
say 0 12 23
that 0 12 23
the 0 12 23
president 0 12 23
does 0 12 23
not 0 12 23
mind 0 12 23
answering 0 12 23
questions, 0 12 23
pointing 0 12 23
to 0 12 23
his 0 12 23
numerous 0 12 23
impromptu 0 12 23
sessions 0 12 23

about 0 12 24
reporters 0 12 24

the 0 12 24
solemnity 0 12 24
of 0 12 24
the 0 12 24
setting, 0 12 24
even 0 12 24
as 0 12 24
Mr. 0 12 24

a 0 12 25
natural 0 12 25
give-and-take,” 0 12 25
Ms. 0 12 25
Sanders 0 12 25
wrote 0 12 25
on 0 12 25
Monday, 0 12 25
suggesting 0 12 25
that 0 12 25
the 0 12 25
onus 0 12 25
was 0 12 25
on 0 12 25
the 0 12 25
press 0 12 25
corps 0 12 25
to 0 12 25

that 0 12 25
a 0 12 25
“code 0 12 25
of 0 12 25
conduct” 0 12 25
did 0 12 25
not 0 12 25
become 0 12 25

necessary. 0 12 26
That 0 12 26
notion 0 12 26
read 0 12 26
more 0 12 26
like 0 12 26
a 0 12 26
warning 0 12 26
— 0 12 26

— 0 12 26
and 0 12 26
the 0 12 26
Correspondents’ 0 12 26
