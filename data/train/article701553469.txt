First 1 62 1
they 1 62 1
came 1 62 1
for 1 62 1
the 1 62 1
Jews. 1 62 1

And 1 62 2
then 1 62 2
they 1 62 2
came 1 62 2
for 1 62 2
everyone 1 62 2
else. 1 62 2

Jewish 0 62 3
students 0 62 3
have 0 62 3
already 0 62 3
faced 0 62 3
plenty 0 62 3
of 0 62 3
harassment 0 62 3
and 0 62 3
hate 0 62 3
at 0 62 3

at 0 62 4
the 0 62 4
Canadian 0 62 4
university 0 62 4

with 0 62 4
a 0 62 4

blatant 1 62 4

A 0 62 5
Jewish 0 62 5
student 0 62 5
at 0 62 5
McGill 0 62 5
University 0 62 5
has 0 62 5
been 0 62 5
kicked 1 62 5
off 1 62 5
the 0 62 5
student 0 62 5
government 0 62 5
board 0 62 5
for 0 62 5
having 0 62 5
“conflicts 0 62 5
of 0 62 5
interest” 0 62 5
due 0 62 5
to 0 62 5
his 0 62 5
pro-Israel 0 62 5
activism. 0 62 5

Third-year 0 62 6
student 0 62 6
Noah 0 62 6
Lew 0 62 6
was 0 62 6
one 0 62 6
of 0 62 6
12 0 62 6
board 0 62 6
members 0 62 6
up 0 62 6
for 0 62 6
general 0 62 6

ratification 0 62 6
on 0 62 6
Monday 0 62 6

The 0 62 7
ratification 0 62 7
vote 0 62 7
is 0 62 7
typically 0 62 7
a 0 62 7
mere 0 62 7
formality, 0 62 7
but 0 62 7
Monday’s 0 62 7
was 0 62 7
different 0 62 7
due 0 62 7
to 0 62 7
Democratize 0 62 7
Student 0 62 7
Society 0 62 7
of 0 62 7
McGill 0 62 7
University 0 62 7
(SSMU), 0 62 7
an 0 62 7
organization 0 62 7
that 0 62 7
was 0 62 7
established 0 62 7
to 0 62 7
resist 0 62 7
the 0 62 7
university’s 0 62 7
ban 0 62 7
of 0 62 7
the 0 62 7

and 0 62 7
Sanctions 0 62 7

movement 0 62 7
on 0 62 7
campus. 0 62 7

Democratize 0 62 8
SSMU 0 62 8
was 0 62 8
able 0 62 8
to 0 62 8
pass 0 62 8
a 0 62 8
motion 0 62 8
that 0 62 8
required 0 62 8
each 0 62 8
board 0 62 8
member 0 62 8
to 0 62 8
be 0 62 8
voted 0 62 8
upon 0 62 8
separately 0 62 8
under 0 62 8
the 0 62 8
grounds 0 62 8
that 0 62 8
they 0 62 8
weren’t 0 62 8
a 0 62 8
fan 0 62 8
of 0 62 8
the 0 62 8
names. 0 62 8

When 0 62 9
it 0 62 9
was 0 62 9
Lew’s 0 62 9
turn, 0 62 9
he 0 62 9
was 0 62 9
voted 0 62 9
down, 0 62 9
105 0 62 9
to 0 62 9
73 0 62 9
with 0 62 9
12 0 62 9
abstaining, 0 62 9
with 0 62 9
applause 0 62 9
following 0 62 9
the 0 62 9
vote. 0 62 9

Two 0 62 10
other 0 62 10
students 0 62 10
who 0 62 10
had 0 62 10
criticized 0 62 10
BDS, 0 62 10
Alexander 0 62 10
Scheffel 0 62 10
and 0 62 10
Josephine 0 62 10
Wright 0 62 10
O’Manique, 0 62 10
were 0 62 10
also 0 62 10
voted 0 62 10
down. 0 62 10

Democratize 0 62 11
SSMU 0 62 11
had 0 62 11
targeted 0 62 11
Lew 0 62 11
and 0 62 11
the 0 62 11
other 0 62 11
two 0 62 11
students 0 62 11
on 0 62 11
the 0 62 11
board 0 62 11
because 0 62 11
they 0 62 11
had 0 62 11
connections 0 62 11
to 0 62 11
the 0 62 11
Canadian 0 62 11
Jewish 0 62 11
Political 0 62 11
Affairs 0 62 11
Committee 0 62 11
(CJPAC) 0 62 11
and 0 62 11
were 0 62 11
involved 0 62 11
in 0 62 11
getting 0 62 11
the 0 62 11
BDS 0 62 11
ban 0 62 11
passed, 0 62 11
which 0 62 11
Democratize 0 62 11
SSMU 0 62 11
claimed 0 62 11
were 0 62 11
“conflicts 0 62 11
of 0 62 11
interests.” 0 62 11

Somehow 0 62 12
I 0 62 12
don't 0 62 12
think 0 62 12
being 0 62 12
a 0 62 12
member 0 62 12
of 0 62 12
a 0 62 12
Muslim 0 62 12
student 0 62 12
group 0 62 12
and 0 62 12
supporting 0 62 12
BDS 0 62 12
would 0 62 12
be 0 62 12
considered 0 62 12
a 0 62 12
conflict 0 62 12
of 0 62 12
interest. 0 62 12

But 0 62 13
the 1 62 13
campus 1 62 13
anti-Israel 1 62 13
crowd 1 62 13
has 0 62 13
been 0 62 13
working 0 62 13
rather 0 62 13
hard 0 62 13
to 0 62 13
intimidate 0 62 13
and 0 62 13
penalize 0 62 13
anyone 0 62 13
involved 0 62 13
in 0 62 13
pro-Israel 0 62 13
organizations. 0 62 13

And 0 62 14
to 0 62 14
keep 0 62 14
their 0 62 14
racist 1 62 14
boycott 1 62 14
movement 1 62 14
going 0 62 14
by 0 62 14
maintaining 0 62 14
control 0 62 14
over 0 62 14
student 0 62 14
governments. 0 62 14

Lew 0 62 15
shared 0 62 15
the 0 62 15
experience 0 62 15
on 0 62 15
Facebook. 0 62 15

“I 0 62 16
have 1 62 16
no 1 62 16
doubt 1 62 16
from 1 62 16
the 1 62 16
information 1 62 16
circulated 1 62 16
about 1 62 16
me 1 62 16
and 1 62 16
campaign 1 62 16
run 1 62 16
against 1 62 16
me 1 62 16
prior 1 62 16
to 1 62 16
this 1 62 16
vote 1 62 16
that 1 62 16
this 1 62 16
was 1 62 16
about 1 62 16
my 1 62 16
Jewish 1 62 16
identity, 1 62 16
and 1 62 16
nothing 1 62 16
more,” 1 62 16
wrote 0 62 16
Lew. 0 62 16

“I 0 62 17
was 0 62 17

right 0 62 17
to 0 62 17
Jewish 0 62 17
self-determination.” 0 62 17
Lew 0 62 17
added 0 62 17
that 0 62 17
the 0 62 17
experience 0 62 17
shows 0 62 17
the 0 62 17
inherent 0 62 17
anti-Semitism 0 62 17
in 0 62 17
the 0 62 17
BDS 0 62 17
movement. 0 62 17

“If 0 62 18
BDS 0 62 18
is 0 62 18
not 0 62 18
anti-Semitic, 0 62 18
why 1 62 18
did 1 62 18
a 1 62 18
BDS-led 1 62 18
campaign 1 62 18
name 1 62 18

on 1 62 18

me 1 62 18
from 1 62 18

for 1 62 18
this 1 62 18
reason?” 1 62 18
wrote 0 62 18
Lew. 0 62 18

“If 1 62 19
BDS 1 62 19

why 1 62 19
was 1 62 19
I 1 62 19
barred 1 62 19
from 1 62 19
participating 1 62 19
in 1 62 19
student 1 62 19

of 1 62 19
my 1 62 19

There 0 62 20
are 0 62 20
some 0 62 20
more 0 62 20
details 0 62 20
here 0 62 20
and 0 62 20
a 0 62 20
petition. 0 62 20

On 0 62 21
Monday 0 62 21
night, 0 62 21
three 0 62 21
students 0 62 21
were 0 62 21
removed 0 62 21
from 0 62 21
the 0 62 21
Board 0 62 21
of 0 62 21
Directors 0 62 21
of 0 62 21
the 0 62 21
Students’ 0 62 21
Society 0 62 21
of 0 62 21
McGill 0 62 21
University 0 62 21
(SSMU), 0 62 21
McGill’s 0 62 21
main 0 62 21
student 0 62 21
government. 0 62 21

All 0 62 22
three 0 62 22
were 0 62 22
targeted 0 62 22
for 0 62 22
removal 0 62 22
either 0 62 22
because 0 62 22
they 0 62 22
are 0 62 22
Jewish 0 62 22
or 0 62 22
have 0 62 22
vocally 0 62 22
opposed 0 62 22
anti-Jewish 0 62 22
discrimination 0 62 22
on 0 62 22
campus. 0 62 22

This 0 62 23
episode 0 62 23
is 0 62 23
utterly 1 62 23
unacceptable, 1 62 23
and 0 62 23
is 0 62 23
merely 0 62 23
the 0 62 23
latest 0 62 23
in 0 62 23
a 0 62 23
long 0 62 23
string 0 62 23
of 0 62 23
antisemitic 0 62 23
incidents 0 62 23
at 0 62 23
your 0 62 23
university. 0 62 23

Indeed, 0 62 24
according 0 62 24
to 0 62 24
eyewitnesses, 0 62 24
one 0 62 24
of 0 62 24
the 0 62 24
members 0 62 24
of 0 62 24
the 0 62 24
mob 0 62 24
that 0 62 24
removed 0 62 24
the 0 62 24
three 0 62 24
directors 0 62 24
was 0 62 24
Igor 0 62 24
Sadikov. 0 62 24

You 0 62 25
will 0 62 25
remember 0 62 25
Sadikov 0 62 25
as 0 62 25
the 0 62 25
student 0 62 25
politician 0 62 25
who 0 62 25
in 0 62 25
February 0 62 25
told 0 62 25
his 0 62 25
followers 0 62 25
to 0 62 25
“punch 1 62 25
a 1 62 25
Zionist 1 62 25
today.” 1 62 25
It 0 62 25
is 0 62 25
unclear 0 62 25
whether 0 62 25
Sadikov 0 62 25
has 0 62 25
faced 0 62 25
any 0 62 25
disciplinary 0 62 25
action 0 62 25
for 0 62 25
this 0 62 25
incitement 0 62 25
to 0 62 25
violence 0 62 25
from 0 62 25
your 0 62 25
administration. 0 62 25

Antisemitism 0 62 26
at 0 62 26
McGill 0 62 26
does 0 62 26
not 0 62 26
emerge 0 62 26
from 0 62 26
a 0 62 26
vacuum. 0 62 26

Rather, 0 62 27
it 0 62 27
has 0 62 27
been 0 62 27
nurtured 0 62 27
in 0 62 27
part 0 62 27
by 0 62 27
a 1 62 27
toxic 1 62 27
campus 1 62 27
press, 1 62 27
especially 0 62 27
the 0 62 27
McGill 0 62 27
Daily, 0 62 27
a 0 62 27
publication 0 62 27
which 0 62 27
openly 0 62 27
refuses 0 62 27
to 0 62 27
publish 0 62 27
any 0 62 27
“Zionist” 0 62 27
content. 0 62 27

In 0 62 28
practice, 0 62 28
this 0 62 28
prevents 0 62 28
McGill’s 0 62 28
Jewish 0 62 28
community 0 62 28
from 0 62 28
defending 0 62 28
itself 0 62 28
against 0 62 28
the 1 62 28
absurd 1 62 28
attacks 1 62 28
to 0 62 28
which 0 62 28
it 0 62 28
is 0 62 28
subjected. 0 62 28

If 0 62 29
the 0 62 29
Daily 0 62 29
is 0 62 29
committed 0 62 29
to 0 62 29
systematically 0 62 29
excluding 0 62 29
the 0 62 29
voices 0 62 29
of 0 62 29
an 0 62 29
ethno-religious 0 62 29
community 0 62 29
on 0 62 29
campus, 0 62 29
then 0 62 29
it 0 62 29
cannot 0 62 29
continue 0 62 29
to 0 62 29
receive 0 62 29
automatic 0 62 29
student 0 62 29
funding, 0 62 29
as 0 62 29
it 0 62 29
does 0 62 29
now. 0 62 29

The 0 62 30
double 0 62 30
standard 0 62 30
here 0 62 30
is 0 62 30
pretty 0 62 30
clear. 0 62 30

And 0 62 30

we 0 62 30

know 1 62 30

exactly 1 62 30

what 1 62 30

the 1 62 30

reaction 1 62 30

would 1 62 30

be 1 62 30

if 1 62 30

a 1 62 30

student 1 62 30

paper 1 62 30

refused 1 62 30

to 1 62 30

publish 1 62 30

any 1 62 30

pro-Islamist 1 62 30

content. 1 62 30
