under 0 370 16

Officer 0 370 17
Guyger 0 370 17
was 0 370 17
terminated 0 370 17
for 0 370 17
her 0 370 17

She 0 370 18
was 0 370 18
hired 0 370 18
in 0 370 18
November 0 370 18
2013 0 370 18
and 0 370 18
was 0 370 18

to 0 370 18
the 0 370 18
Southeast 0 370 18

right 0 370 19
to 0 370 19

her 0 370 19
discipline. 0 370 19

This 0 370 20
move 0 370 20
is 0 370 20
noteworthy 0 370 20
as 0 370 20
the 0 370 20
department 0 370 20
has 0 370 20
been 0 370 20
standing 0 370 20
up 0 370 20
against 0 370 20
those 0 370 20

to 0 370 20

As 0 370 21
recently 0 370 21
as 0 370 21
Friday, 0 370 21
Hall 0 370 21
refused 0 370 21
to 0 370 21
fire 0 370 21
Guyger, 0 370 21
saying 0 370 21
in 0 370 21
part, 0 370 21
“There 0 370 21
is 0 370 21
one 0 370 21
overriding 0 370 21
reason 0 370 21
that 0 370 21
I 0 370 21
have 0 370 21
not 0 370 21
taken 0 370 21
any 0 370 21
administrative 0 370 21
or 0 370 21
employment 0 370 21
action 0 370 21
against 0 370 21
Officer 0 370 21
Amber 0 370 21
Guyger. 0 370 21

I 0 370 22
don’t 0 370 22
want 0 370 22
to 0 370 22
interfere 0 370 22
with 0 370 22
the 0 370 22
on-going 0 370 22
criminal 0 370 22
investigation 0 370 22
into 0 370 22
her 0 370 22
actions.” 0 370 22

Also, 0 370 23
in 0 370 23
a 0 370 23
town 0 370 23
hall 0 370 23
meeting 0 370 23
last 0 370 23
week, 0 370 23
Hall 0 370 23
again 0 370 23
stood 0 370 23
behind 0 370 23
her 0 370 23
choice 0 370 23
to 0 370 23
refuse 0 370 23
to 0 370 23
fire 0 370 23
Guyger, 0 370 23
claiming 0 370 23
it 0 370 23
would 0 370 23
be 0 370 23
against 0 370 23
the 0 370 23
law. 0 370 23

“I 0 370 24
can’t 0 370 24
do 0 370 24
that 0 370 24
because 0 370 24
there 0 370 24
are 0 370 24
both 0 370 24
local, 0 370 24
state 0 370 24
and 0 370 24
federal 0 370 24
laws 0 370 24
that 0 370 24
prohibit 0 370 24
me 0 370 24
from 0 370 24
taking 0 370 24
action. 0 370 24

There 0 370 25
are 0 370 25
civil 0 370 25
service 0 370 25
laws 0 370 25
we 0 370 25
have 0 370 25
to 0 370 25
adhere 0 370 25
to,” 0 370 25
said 0 370 25
Hall. 0 370 25

Apparently, 0 370 26
it 0 370 26
is 0 370 26
no 0 370 26
longer 0 370 26
against 0 370 26
the 0 370 26
law. 0 370 26

This 0 370 27
news 0 370 27
will 0 370 27
likely 0 370 27
be 0 370 27
well 0 370 27
received 0 370 27
by 0 370 27
the 0 370 27
Jean 0 370 27
family 0 370 27
as 0 370 27
well 0 370 27
as 0 370 27
the 0 370 27
activists 0 370 27
who 0 370 27
have 0 370 27
been 0 370 27
calling 0 370 27
for 0 370 27
justice 0 370 27
for 0 370 27
Botham 0 370 27
since 0 370 27
the 0 370 27
beginning. 0 370 27

As 0 370 28
TFTP 0 370 28
previously 0 370 28
reported, 0 370 28
the 0 370 28
idea 0 370 28
of 0 370 28
not 0 370 28
firing 0 370 28
Guyger 0 370 28
seemed 0 370 28
utterly 1 370 28
preposterous 1 370 28
as 0 370 28
she 0 370 28
admitted 0 370 28
to 0 370 28
doing 0 370 28
something 0 370 28
wrong. 0 370 28

While 0 370 29
controversy 0 370 29
swarms 0 370 29
the 0 370 29
case 0 370 29
of 0 370 29
why 0 370 29
she 0 370 29
may 0 370 29
have 0 370 29
killed 0 370 29
Jean, 0 370 29
there 0 370 29
is 0 370 29
no 0 370 29
doubt 0 370 29
that 0 370 29
she 0 370 29
did 0 370 29
kill 0 370 29
him. 0 370 29

This 0 370 30
is 0 370 30
a 0 370 30
fact. 0 370 30

This 0 370 31
public 0 370 31
servant 0 370 31
walked 0 370 31
into 0 370 31
an 0 370 31
innocent 1 370 31
man’s 0 370 31
home 0 370 31
and 0 370 31
shot 0 370 31
him 0 370 31
dead. 0 370 31

Because 0 370 32
of 0 370 32
her 0 370 32
actions, 0 370 32
this 0 370 32
man 0 370 32
no 0 370 32
longer 0 370 32
lives. 0 370 32

This 0 370 33
alone 0 370 33
should 0 370 33
have 0 370 33
been 0 370 33
enough 0 370 33
to 0 370 33
fire 0 370 33
her. 0 370 33

Surprisingly 0 370 34
enough, 0 370 34
NRA 0 370 34
spokesperson 0 370 34
Dana 0 370 34
Loesch 0 370 34
responded 0 370 34
to 0 370 34
the 0 370 34
firing 0 370 34
of 0 370 34
Guyger 0 370 34
with 0 370 34
one 0 370 34
word, 0 370 34
“Good,” 0 370 34
showing 0 370 34
her 0 370 34
support 0 370 34
for 0 370 34
the 0 370 34
move. 0 370 34

For 0 370 35
those 0 370 35
who 0 370 35
don’t 0 370 35
recall, 0 370 35
Loesch 0 370 35
sparked 0 370 35
controversy 0 370 35
earlier 0 370 35
this 0 370 35
month 0 370 35
by 0 370 35
claiming 0 370 35
that 0 370 35
if 0 370 35
Botham 0 370 35
Jean 0 370 35
were 0 370 35
a 0 370 35
gun 0 370 35
owner, 0 370 35
he 0 370 35
may 0 370 35
be 0 370 35
alive 0 370 35
today. 0 370 35

Indeed, 0 370 36
as 0 370 36
TFTP 0 370 36
reported 0 370 36
over 0 370 36
the 0 370 36
weekend, 0 370 36
a 0 370 36
father 0 370 36
in 0 370 36
Prince 0 370 36
George’s 0 370 36
County 0 370 36
opened 0 370 36
fire 0 370 36
on 0 370 36
officers 0 370 36
as 0 370 36
they 0 370 36
wrongly 0 370 36
entered 0 370 36
his 0 370 36
apartment. 0 370 36

He 0 370 37
shot 0 370 37
two 0 370 37
officers. 0 370 37

Not 0 370 38
only 0 370 38
was 0 370 38
he 0 370 38
not 0 370 38
arrested, 0 370 38
but 0 370 38
the 0 370 38
police 0 370 38
chief 0 370 38
praised 0 370 38
him 0 370 38
and 0 370 38
apologized. 0 370 38

In 0 370 39
response 0 370 39
to 0 370 39
Guyger’s 0 370 39
termination, 0 370 39
the 0 370 39
family’s 0 370 39
attorney, 0 370 39
Lee 0 370 39
Merritt 0 370 39
noted 0 370 39
that 0 370 39
the 0 370 39
family 0 370 39
expressed 0 370 39
“satisfaction” 0 370 39
with 0 370 39
the 0 370 39
move. 0 370 39

“The 0 370 40
Jean 0 370 40
family 0 370 40
expressed 0 370 40
satisfaction 0 370 40

explanation 0 370 40
and 0 370 40
in 0 370 40

We 0 370 41
see 0 370 41
it 0 370 41
as 0 370 41
an 0 370 41
initial 0 370 41
victory 0 370 41
— 0 370 41
