The 0
department 0
then 0
went 0
on 0
to 0
note 0
that 0
Guyger 0
could 0
appeal 0
this 0
firing 0
under 0
their 0
civil 0
service 0
rules. 0

Officer 0
Guyger 0
was 0
terminated 0
for 0
her 0
actions. 0

She 0
was 0
hired 0
in 0
November 0
2013 0
and 0
was 0
assigned 0
to 0
the 0
Southeast 0
Patrol 0
Division. 0

Under 0
civil 0
service 0
rules, 0
Officer 0
Guyger 0
has 0
the 0
right 0
to 0
appeal 0
her 0
discipline. 0

This 0
move 0
is 0
noteworthy 0
as 0
the 0
department 0
has 0
been 0
standing 0
up 0
against 0
those 0
who 0
have 0
been 0
calling 0
for 0
the 0
officer 0
to 0
be 0
fired. 0

As 0
recently 0
as 0
Friday, 0
Hall 0
refused 0
to 0
fire 0
Guyger, 0
saying 0
in 0
part, 0
“There 0
is 0
one 0
overriding 0
reason 0
that 0
I 0
have 0
not 0
taken 0
any 0
administrative 0
or 0
employment 0
action 0
against 0
Officer 0
Amber 0
Guyger. 0

I 0
don’t 0
want 0
to 0
interfere 0
with 0
the 0
on-going 0
criminal 0
investigation 0
into 0
her 0
actions.” 0

Also, 0
in 0
a 0
town 0
hall 0
meeting 0
last 0
week, 0
Hall 0
again 0
stood 0
behind 0
her 0
choice 0
to 0
refuse 0
to 0
fire 0
Guyger, 0
claiming 0
it 0
would 0
be 0
against 0
the 0
law. 0

“I 0
can’t 0
do 0
that 0
because 0
there 0
are 0
both 0
local, 0
state 0
and 0
federal 0
laws 0
that 0
prohibit 0
me 0
from 0
taking 0
action. 0

There 0
are 0
civil 0
service 0
laws 0
we 0
have 0
to 0
adhere 0
to,” 0
said 0
Hall. 0

Apparently, 0
it 0
is 0
no 0
longer 0
against 0
the 0
law. 0

This 0
news 0
will 0
likely 0
be 0
well 0
received 0
by 0
the 0
Jean 0
family 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
the 0
activists 0
who 0
have 0
been 0
calling 0
for 0
justice 0
for 0
Botham 0
since 0
the 0
beginning. 0

As 0
TFTP 0
previously 0
reported, 0
the 0
idea 0
of 0
not 0
firing 0
Guyger 0
seemed 0
utterly 1
preposterous 1
as 0
she 0
admitted 0
to 0
doing 0
something 0
wrong. 0

While 0
controversy 0
swarms 0
the 0
case 0
of 0
why 0
she 0
may 0
have 0
killed 0
Jean, 0
there 0
is 0
no 0
doubt 0
that 0
she 0
did 0
kill 0
him. 0

This 0
is 0
a 0
fact. 0

This 0
public 0
servant 0
walked 0
into 0
an 0
innocent 1
man’s 0
home 0
and 0
shot 0
him 0
dead. 0

Because 0
of 0
her 0
actions, 0
this 0
man 0
no 0
longer 0
lives. 0

This 0
alone 0
should 0
have 0
been 0
enough 0
to 0
fire 0
her. 0

Surprisingly 0
enough, 0
NRA 0
spokesperson 0
Dana 0
Loesch 0
responded 0
to 0
the 0
firing 0
of 0
Guyger 0
with 0
one 0
word, 0
“Good,” 0
showing 0
her 0
support 0
for 0
the 0
move. 0

For 0
those 0
who 0
don’t 0
recall, 0
Loesch 0
sparked 0
controversy 0
earlier 0
this 0
month 0
by 0
claiming 0
that 0
if 0
Botham 0
Jean 0
were 0
a 0
gun 0
owner, 0
he 0
may 0
be 0
alive 0
today. 0

Indeed, 0
as 0
TFTP 0
reported 0
over 0
the 0
weekend, 0
a 0
father 0
in 0
Prince 0
George’s 0
County 0
opened 0
fire 0
on 0
officers 0
as 0
they 0
wrongly 0
entered 0
his 0
apartment. 0

He 0
shot 0
two 0
officers. 0

Not 0
only 0
was 0
he 0
not 0
arrested, 0
but 0
the 0
police 0
chief 0
praised 0
him 0
and 0
apologized. 0

In 0
response 0
to 0
Guyger’s 0
termination, 0
the 0
family’s 0
attorney, 0
Lee 0
Merritt 0
noted 0
that 0
the 0
family 0
expressed 0
“satisfaction” 0
with 0
the 0
move. 0

“The 0
Jean 0
family 0
expressed 0
satisfaction 0
in 0
this 0
explanation 0
and 0
in 0
Guyger’s 0
termination. 0

We 0
see 0
it 0
as 0
an 0
initial 0
victory 0
— 0
well 0
received 0
on 0
the 0
day 0
Botham 0
Jean 0
is 0
laid 0
to 0
rest 0
in 0
his 0
native 0
country 0
in 0
St. 0
Lucia,” 0
Merritt’s 0
office 0
said 0
in 0
a 0
statement, 0
adding 0
that 0
they 0
are 0
committed 0
to 0
see 0
a 0
“proper 0
murder 0
indictment, 0
conviction 0
and 0
appropriate 0
sentencing.” 0
