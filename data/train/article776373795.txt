the 0 199 22
president 0 199 22
to 0 199 22

frequently 1 199 30
defends 1 199 30
Trump 1 199 30
on 1 199 30
television. 1 199 30

In 1 199 31
an 1 199 31
interview 1 199 31
with 1 199 31
the 1 199 31
Los 1 199 31
Angeles 1 199 31
Times, 1 199 31
Dershowitz 1 199 31
said 1 199 31
he 1 199 31
does 1 199 31
not 1 199 31
believe 1 199 31
Sessions 1 199 31
has 1 199 31
the 1 199 31
authority 1 199 31
to 1 199 31
end 1 199 31
the 1 199 31
probe. 1 199 31

“You 1 199 32
can’t 1 199 32
be 1 199 32
both 1 199 32
recused 1 199 32
and 1 199 32
making 1 199 32
decisions 1 199 32
about 1 199 32
the 1 199 32
investigation,” 1 199 32
he 1 199 32
said. 1 199 32

But 0 199 33
Dershowitz 0 199 33
also 0 199 33
cast 0 199 33
doubt 0 199 33
on 0 199 33
whether 0 199 33
Trump’s 0 199 33
tweets 0 199 33
can 0 199 33
be 0 199 33
seen 0 199 33
as 0 199 33
an 0 199 33
act 0 199 33
of 0 199 33
obstruction. 0 199 33

“You 0 199 34
cannot 0 199 34
obstruct 0 199 34
justice 0 199 34
by 0 199 34
openly 0 199 34
exercising 0 199 34
your 0 199 34
First 0 199 34
Amendment 0 199 34
rights 0 199 34
and 0 199 34
openly 0 199 34
criticizing 0 199 34
a 0 199 34
prosecution, 0 199 34
whether 0 199 34
you’re 0 199 34
right 0 199 34
or 0 199 34
wrong,” 0 199 34
he 0 199 34
said. 0 199 34

“Obstruction 0 199 35
of 0 199 35
justice 0 199 35
is 0 199 35
generally 0 199 35
committed 0 199 35
behind 0 199 35
the 0 199 35
scenes, 0 199 35
so 0 199 35
I 0 199 35
think 0 199 35
both 0 199 35
sides 0 199 35
are 0 199 35
a 0 199 35
little 0 199 35
overwrought 0 199 35
here.” 0 199 35

Stephen 0 199 36
Vladeck, 0 199 36
a 0 199 36
University 0 199 36
of 0 199 36
Texas 0 199 36
law 0 199 36
professor, 0 199 36
agreed 0 199 36
that 0 199 36
Sessions 0 199 36
cannot 0 199 36
stop 0 199 36
the 0 199 36
Russia 0 199 36
investigation 0 199 36
given 0 199 36
that 0 199 36
he 0 199 36
recused 0 199 36
himself. 0 199 36

“The 0 199 37
president, 0 199 37
intentionally 0 199 37
or 0 199 37
not, 0 199 37
is 0 199 37
misdirecting 1 199 37
his 1 199 37
ire,” 1 199 37
Vladeck 0 199 37
said. 0 199 37

If 0 199 38
Trump 0 199 38
wanted 0 199 38
to 0 199 38
use 0 199 38
his 0 199 38
power 0 199 38
to 0 199 38
end 0 199 38
the 0 199 38
probe, 0 199 38
he 0 199 38
would 0 199 38
have 0 199 38
to 0 199 38
give 0 199 38
the 0 199 38
order 0 199 38
to 0 199 38
Rod 0 199 38

supervising 0 199 38

work, 0 199 38
and 0 199 38
fire 0 199 38
Rosenstein 0 199 38
if 0 199 38
he 0 199 38
does 0 199 38
not 0 199 38
comply, 0 199 38
according 0 199 38
to 0 199 38
Vladeck. 0 199 38

Trump 0 199 39
could 0 199 39
also 0 199 39
try 0 199 39
to 0 199 39
replace 0 199 39
Sessions 0 199 39
as 0 199 39
attorney 0 199 39
general 0 199 39
with 0 199 39
someone 0 199 39
