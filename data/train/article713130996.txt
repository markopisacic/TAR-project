Gonzalez 0 104 5
is 0 104 5
contending 0 104 5
the 0 104 5

“He 1 104 17

included 0 104 19

quite 0 104 19
possibly 0 104 19
false-documented 0 104 19

True 0 104 20
to 0 104 20
form, 0 104 20
judge 0 104 20
Samuel 0 104 20

the 0 104 20
identities 0 104 20
of 0 104 20
the 0 104 20
jurors. 0 104 20

So 0 104 21
observers 0 104 21
have 0 104 21
grounds 0 104 21
to 0 104 21
believe 0 104 21
that 0 104 21
Garcia 0 104 21
and 0 104 21
Gonzalez 0 104 21
both 0 104 21
got 0 104 21
the 0 104 21
jury 0 104 21
they 0 104 21
wanted. 0 104 21

Garcia 0 104 22
told 0 104 22
the 0 104 22
court 0 104 22
Zarate 0 104 22
was 0 104 22
playing 0 104 22
his 0 104 22
own 0 104 22
“secret 1 104 22
version 1 104 22
of 1 104 22
Russian 1 104 22
roulette,” 1 104 22
and 0 104 22
thus 0 104 22
parroted 0 104 22
the 0 104 22
defense’s 0 104 22
contention 0 104 22
that 0 104 22
the 0 104 22
shooting 0 104 22
was 0 104 22
all 0 104 22
a 0 104 22
matter 0 104 22
of 0 104 22
chance. 0 104 22

As 0 104 23
it 0 104 23
happens, 0 104 23
in 0 104 23
Russian 0 104 23
roulette 0 104 23
a 0 104 23
shooter 0 104 23
loads 0 104 23
one 0 104 23
bullet 0 104 23
into 0 104 23
a 0 104 23
six-shot 0 104 23
revolver, 0 104 23
spins 0 104 23
the 0 104 23
cylinder, 0 104 23
then 0 104 23
puts 0 104 23
the 0 104 23
gun 0 104 23
to 0 104 23
his 0 104 23
own 0 104 23
head 0 104 23
and 0 104 23
pulls 0 104 23
the 0 104 23
trigger. 0 104 23

In 0 104 24
a 0 104 24
central 0 104 24
fact 0 104 24
of 0 104 24
the 0 104 24
case, 0 104 24
Zarate 0 104 24
did 0 104 24
not 0 104 24
aim 0 104 24
the 0 104 24
gun 0 104 24
at 0 104 24
himself 0 104 24
but 0 104 24
fired 0 104 24
in 0 104 24
the 0 104 24
direction 0 104 24
of 0 104 24
Kate 0 104 24
Steinle. 0 104 24

In 0 104 25
another 0 104 25
established 0 104 25
fact, 0 104 25
the 0 104 25
bullet 0 104 25
struck 0 104 25
her 0 104 25
in 0 104 25
the 0 104 25
lower 0 104 25
back 0 104 25
and 0 104 25
tore 0 104 25
through 0 104 25
her 0 104 25
abdominal 0 104 25
aorta. 0 104 25

This 0 104 26
happened 0 104 26
in 0 104 26
broad 0 104 26
daylight, 0 104 26
but 0 104 26
as 0 104 26
in 0 104 26
In 0 104 26
the 0 104 26
Heat 0 104 26
of 0 104 26
the 0 104 26
Night, 0 104 26
they 0 104 26
had 0 104 26
the 0 104 26
body 0 104 26
which 0 104 26
was 0 104 26
dead. 0 104 26

Garcia 0 104 27
Zarate 0 104 27
confessed 0 104 27
to 0 104 27
firing 0 104 27
the 0 104 27
shot 0 104 27
and 0 104 27
had 0 104 27
gunpowder 0 104 27
residue 0 104 27
on 0 104 27
his 0 104 27
hands. 0 104 27

After 0 104 28
firing, 0 104 28
he 0 104 28
tossed 0 104 28
the 0 104 28
gun 0 104 28
in 0 104 28
the 0 104 28
water. 0 104 28

He 0 104 29
said 0 104 29
he 0 104 29
had 0 104 29
found 0 104 29
the 0 104 29
stolen 0 104 29
weapon 0 104 29
wrapped 0 104 29
in 0 104 29
a 0 104 29
cloth 0 104 29
and 0 104 29
that 0 104 29
it 0 104 29
discharged 0 104 29
by 0 104 29
itself, 0 104 29
both 0 104 29
utterly 0 104 29
unbelievable 0 104 29
claims. 0 104 29

Even 0 104 30
so, 0 104 30
the 0 104 30
politically 0 104 30
correct 0 104 30
jury 0 104 30
found 0 104 30
the 0 104 30
career 0 104 30
criminal 0 104 30
not 0 104 30
guilty 0 104 30
of 0 104 30
murder 0 104 30
and 0 104 30
manslaughter. 0 104 30

Any 0 104 31
observer 0 104 31
could 0 104 31
be 0 104 31
forgiven 0 104 31
for 0 104 31
believing 0 104 31
that 0 104 31
prosecution 0 104 31
and 0 104 31
defense 0 104 31
both 0 104 31
got 0 104 31
the 0 104 31
outcome 0 104 31
they 0 104 31
wanted. 0 104 31

Unlike 1 104 32
Stalin’s 1 104 32
trials 1 104 32
of 1 104 32
the 1 104 32
old 1 104 32

this 1 104 32
show 1 104 32
trial 1 104 32
aimed 1 104 32
to 1 104 32
establish 1 104 32
innocence 1 104 32
for 1 104 32
the 1 104 32
guilty, 1 104 32
and 1 104 32
the 1 104 32
dynamics 1 104 32
of 1 104 32
the 1 104 32
left 1 104 32
were 1 104 32
on 1 104 32
full 1 104 32
display. 1 104 32

Denunciations 0 104 33
of 0 104 33
“gun 0 104 33
violence” 0 104 33
were 0 104 33
nowhere 0 104 33
in 0 104 33
evidence 0 104 33
and 0 104 33
expressions 0 104 33
of 0 104 33
