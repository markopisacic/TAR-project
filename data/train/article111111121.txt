The 0

fired 0
Officer 0
Amber 0
Guyger 0
on 0
Monday, 0
two 0
weeks 0
after 0
she 0
was 0
charged 0
in 0
the 0
fatal 0
shooting 0
of 0
her 0
neighbor. 0

This 0
contradicted 0
the 0
police 0
chief’s 0
recent 0
statements 0
that 0
she 0
was 0
unable 0
to 0
discipline 0
the 0
officer 0
while 0
a 0
criminal 0
investigation 0
proceeded. 0

Guyger 0

allegedly 0
walked 0
into 0
the 0
apartment 0
of 0
the 0
neighbor, 0
Botham 0
Jean, 0
and 0
fatally 0
shot 0
him 0
Sept 0
6. 0

When 0

she 0
was 0
arrested 0
three 0
days 0
later 0
on 0
manslaughter 0
charges, 0
Guyger 0
said 0
she 0
confused 0
Jean’s 0
home 0
for 0
her 0
own, 0
confused 0
Jean 0
for 0
an 0
intruder, 0
and 0
shot 0
him 0
when 0
he 0
refused 0
her 0
commands, 0
according 0
to 0
court 0
documents. 0

The 0
victim’s 0
family 0
has 0
disputed 0
her 0
account 0
and 0
said 0
she 0
had 0
knocked 0
on 0
Jean’s 0
door 0
before 0
killing 0
him. 0

The 0

than 0
700 0

by 0
The 0
Washington 0
Post 0
this 0
year 0
— 0
sparked 0
criticism 0
against 0
the 0
police 0
department, 0
which 0
waited 0
days 0
to 0
arrest 0
Guyger, 0
then 0
went 0
weeks 0
without 0
disciplining 0
her 0
even 0
though 0
she 0
was 0
placed 0
on 0
leave. 0

“The 0
delay 0
raised 0
questions 0
about 0
why 0
investigators 0
held 0
off 0
on 0
arresting 0
the 0
officer 0
and 0
about 0
whether 0
law 0
enforcement 0
authorities 0
were 0
showing 0
deferential 0
treatment 0
for 0
one 0
of 0
their 0
own,” 0

The 0

After 0

repeated 0
protests, 0
Police 0
Chief 0
U. 0
Reneé 0
Hall 0
gave 0
contradictory 0
explanations 0
last 0
week 0
for 0
why 0
she 0
could 0
not 0
fire 0
the 0
officer. 0

She 0
told 0
a 0
town 0
hall 0
that 0
“local, 0
state 0
and 0
federal 0
laws 0
prohibit 0
me 0
from 0
taking 0
action,” 0
according 0
to 0
ABC 0
affiliate 0
WFAA. 0

Two 0

days 0
later, 0
the 0
Dallas 0
Morning 0
News 0
reported 0
that 0
police 0
could 0
fire 0
Guyger 0
but 0
did 0
not 0
plan 0
to 0
review 0
her 0
employment 0
until 0
a 0
criminal 0
investigation 0
wrapped 0
up 0
— 0
probably 0
months 0
away. 0

In 0
a 0
statement, 0
Hall 0
said 0
that 0
any 0
disciplinary 0
investigation 0
would 0
risk 0
compromising 0
the 0
criminal 0
case. 0

“That 0
is 0
not 0
a 0
risk 0
I 0
am 0
willing 0
to 0
take,” 0
she 0
said. 0

Police 0

did 0
not 0
explain 0
what 0
changed 0
by 0
Monday, 0
when 0
the 0
department 0
announced 0
that 0
an 0
internal-affairs 0
investigation 0
had 0
been 0
launched 0
and 0
already 0
“concluded” 0
that 0
Guyger’s 0
arrest 0
was 0
a 0
fireable 0
offense. 0

The 0
officer, 0
who 0
was 0
hired 0
in 0
late 0
2013, 0
was 0
terminated 0
during 0
a 0
hearing 0
Monday 0
morning 0
“for 0
her 0
actions.” 0

The 0

statement 0
notes 0
that 0
Guyger 0
can 0
appeal 0
her 0
firing. 0

Police 0
did 0
not 0
comment 0
on 0
whether 0
Hall 0
is 0
still 0
worried 0
that 0
the 0
termination 0
might 0
affect 0
the 0
criminal 0
investigation. 0

As 0

Paul 0
wrote 0
for 0
The 0
Post, 0
the 0
more 0
significant 0
legal 0
questions 0
are 0
whether 0
Guyger 0
is 0
prosecuted 0
as 0
a 0
police 0
officer 0
or 0
civilian 0
and 0
whether 0
a 0
jury 0
decides 0
she 0
acted 0
reasonably 0
in 0
using 0
deadly 0
force. 0
