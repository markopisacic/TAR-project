“I 0
absolutely, 1
unqualifiedly 1
denounce 1
and 1
reject 1
the 1
views 1
of 1
Louis 1
Farrakhan," 1
said 0
Ellison. 0

"I’ve 0
said 0
that 0
many, 0
many 0
years 0
ago.” 0

“Look, 0
in 0
the 0
early 0
1990s, 0
Louis 0
Farrakhan 0
was 0
a 0
person 0
speaking 0
the 0
issues 0
of 0
African-American 0
civil 0
rights," 0
Ellison 0
added. 0

"At 0

he 0

some 0
things, 0
I 0
thought, 0
he 0

then 0
concluded, 0
"He 0
made 0
it 0
very 0
clear 0
in 0
the 0
early 0
90s 0
that 0
his 1
views 1
and 1
mine 1
were 1
absolutely 1
incompatible, 1
and 0
I’ve 0
been 0
saying 0
that 0

Keith, 0
you're 0
lying. 0

It's 0
clear 0
from 0
video 0
evidence 0
that 0
Ellison 0
and 0
fellow 0
Democrat 0
Gregory 0

had 0
dinner 0
with 0
Farrakhan 0
and 0
Iranian 0

Take 0
a 0
look 0
for 0
yourself 0
and 0
understand 0
how 0
pathological 0
liar 0
and 0
accused 0
woman 0
abuser 0
Keith 0
Ellison 0
seeks 0
to 0
deceive 0
you. 0

In 0
case 0
you 0
missed 0
it, 0
here's 1
a 1
still 1
frame 1
of 1
Ellison 1
just 1
a 1
few 1
feet 1
away 1
from 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
has 1
called 1
on 1
10,000 1
blacks 1
to 1
stalk 1
and 1
murder 1
white 1
people. 1

Both 0
of 0
these 0
men 0
have 0
the 0
same 0
devil 0
as 0
their 0
father 0
because 0
both 0
men 0
are 0
following 0
after 0
the 0
teaching 0
of 0
the 0
Koran 0
. 0

One 0
of 0
them 0
just 0
actually 0
has 0
the 0
nerve 0
to 0
say 0
it. 0

The 0
other 0
doesn't. 0

Maybe 0
Ellison 0
is 0
attempting 0
to 1
pull 1
an 1
Obama. 1

Remember 0
when 0
Obama's 0
"pastor," 0
Jeremiah 0
Wright 0
uttered 0
"God 0
damn, 0
America!"? 0

Obama 0
tried 0
to 0
say 0
he 0
had 0
been 0
in 0
that 0
church 0
for 0
years 0
and 0
never 0
heard 0
such 0
things, 0
which 0
isn't 0
true. 0

Ellison 1
is 1
attempting 1
to 1
do 1
that 1
same. 1
