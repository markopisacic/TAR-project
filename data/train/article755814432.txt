Rudy 0 89 1
Giuliani 0 89 1
the 0 89 1
concept 0 89 1
of 0 89 1

to 0 89 1
carry 0 89 1
out 0 89 1

against 0 89 1
the 0 89 1
United 0 89 1
States 0 89 1
on 0 89 1
9/11. 0 89 1

They 0 89 2
didn’t 0 89 2
do 0 89 2
it 0 89 2
because 0 89 2
we 0 89 2
are 0 89 2
so 0 89 2
rich 0 89 2
and 0 89 2
so 0 89 2
free, 0 89 2
as 0 89 2
the 0 89 2
neocons 0 89 2
would 0 89 2
have 0 89 2
us 0 89 2
believe. 0 89 2

They 0 89 3
came 0 89 3
over 0 89 3
here 0 89 3
because 0 89 3
we 0 89 3
had 0 89 3
been 0 89 3
killing 0 89 3
Muslims 0 89 3
“over 0 89 3
there” 0 89 3
for 0 89 3
decades. 0 89 3

How 0 89 4
do 0 89 4
we 0 89 4
know 0 89 4
this? 0 89 4

Well, 0 89 5
they 0 89 5
told 0 89 5
us. 0 89 5

Osama 0 89 6
bin 0 89 6
Laden 0 89 6
made 0 89 6
it 0 89 6
clear 0 89 6
why 0 89 6
al-Qaeda 0 89 6
sought 0 89 6
to 0 89 6
attack 0 89 6
the 0 89 6
US. 0 89 6

They 0 89 7
didn’t 0 89 7
like 0 89 7
the 0 89 7
US 0 89 7
taking 0 89 7
sides 0 89 7
in 0 89 7
the 0 89 7
Israel-Palestine 0 89 7
conflict 0 89 7
and 0 89 7
they 0 89 7
didn’t 0 89 7

US 0 89 7
troops 0 89 7
on 0 89 7
their 0 89 7

Why 0 89 8
believe 0 89 8
a 0 89 8
terrorist, 0 89 8
some 0 89 8
responded. 0 89 8

Unfortunately, 0 89 20
it 0 89 20
is 0 89 20
clear 0 89 20
that 0 89 20
Giuliani 0 89 20
never 0 89 20
really 0 89 20
understood 0 89 20
what 0 89 20
I 0 89 20
was 0 89 20
trying 0 89 20
to 0 89 20
tell 0 89 20
him. 0 89 20

Like 0 89 21
the 0 89 21
rest 0 89 21
of 0 89 21
the 0 89 21
neocons, 0 89 21
he 0 89 21
either 0 89 21
doesn’t 0 89 21

it 0 89 21
or 0 89 21
doesn’t 0 89 21
want 0 89 21
to 0 89 21
get 0 89 21
it. 0 89 21

In 0 89 22
a 0 89 22
recent 0 89 22
speech 0 89 22
to 0 89 22
the 0 89 22
MeK 0 89 22
– 0 89 22
a 0 89 22
violent 1 89 22
Islamist-Marxist 0 89 22
cult 0 89 22
that 0 89 22
spent 0 89 22
two 0 89 22
decades 0 89 22
on 0 89 22
the 0 89 22
US 0 89 22
terror 0 89 22
watch 0 89 22
list 0 89 22
– 0 89 22
Giuliani 0 89 22
promised 0 89 22
that 0 89 22
the 0 89 22
Trump 0 89 22
Administration 0 89 22
had 0 89 22
made 0 89 22
“regime 0 89 22
change” 0 89 22
a 0 89 22
priority 0 89 22
for 0 89 22
Iran. 0 89 22

He 0 89 23
even 0 89 23
told 0 89 23
the 0 89 23
members 0 89 23
of 0 89 23
that 0 89 23
organization 0 89 23
– 0 89 23
an 0 89 23
organization 0 89 23
that 0 89 23
has 0 89 23
killed 1 89 23
dozens 1 89 23
of 1 89 23
Americans 1 89 23
– 0 89 23
that 0 89 23
Trump 0 89 23
would 0 89 23
put 0 89 23
them 0 89 23
in 0 89 23
charge 0 89 23
of 0 89 23
Iran! 0 89 23

Giuliani 0 89 24
shares 0 89 24
with 0 89 24
numerous 0 89 24
other 0 89 24
neocons 0 89 24
like 0 89 24
John 0 89 24
Bolton 0 89 24
a 0 89 24
strong 0 89 24
relationship 0 89 24
with 0 89 24
this 0 89 24
group. 0 89 24

In 0 89 25
fact, 0 89 25
both 0 89 25
Giuliani 0 89 25
and 0 89 25
Bolton 0 89 25
have 0 89 25
been 0 89 25
on 0 89 25
the 0 89 25
payroll 0 89 25
of 0 89 25
the 0 89 25
MeK 0 89 25
and 0 89 25
have 0 89 25
received 0 89 25
tens 0 89 25
of 0 89 25
thousands 0 89 25
of 0 89 25
dollars 0 89 25
to 0 89 25
speak 0 89 25
to 0 89 25
their 0 89 25
followers. 0 89 25

This 0 89 26
is 0 89 26
another 0 89 26
example 0 89 26
of 0 89 26
how 0 89 26
foreign 0 89 26
lobbies 0 89 26
and 0 89 26
special 0 89 26
interest 0 89 26
groups 0 89 26
maintain 0 89 26
an 0 89 26
iron 0 89 26
grip 0 89 26
on 0 89 26
our 0 89 26
foreign 0 89 26
policy. 0 89 26

Does 1 89 27
anyone 1 89 27
really 1 89 27
think 1 89 27
Iran 1 89 27
will 1 89 27
be 1 89 27
better 1 89 27
off 1 89 27
if 1 89 27
Trump 1 89 27
puts 1 89 27
a 1 89 27
bunch 1 89 27
of 1 89 27
“former” 1 89 27
terrorists 1 89 27
in 1 89 27
charge 1 89 27
of 1 89 27
the 1 89 27
country? 1 89 27

How 1 89 28
did 1 89 28
that 1 89 28
work 1 89 28
in 1 89 28
Libya? 1 89 28

It’s 0 89 29
easy 0 89 29
to 0 89 29
dismiss 0 89 29
the 0 89 29
bombastic 0 89 29
Giuliani 0 89 29
as 0 89 29
he 0 89 29
speaks 0 89 29
to 0 89 29
his 0 89 29
financial 0 89 29
benefactors 0 89 29
in 0 89 29
the 0 89 29
MeK. 0 89 29

Unfortunately, 0 89 30
however, 0 89 30
Giuliani’s 0 89 30
claims 0 89 30
were 0 89 30
confirmed 0 89 30
late 0 89 30
last 0 89 30
week, 0 89 30
when 0 89 30
the 0 89 30
Washington 0 89 30
Free 0 89 30
Beacon 0 89 30
published 0 89 30
a 0 89 30
three-page 0 89 30
policy 0 89 30
paper 0 89 30
being 0 89 30
circulated 0 89 30
among 0 89 30
National 0 89 30
Security 0 89 30
Council 0 89 30
officials 0 89 30
containing 0 89 30
plans 0 89 30
to 0 89 30
spark 0 89 30
regime 0 89 30
change 0 89 30
in 0 89 30
Iran. 0 89 30

The 0 89 31
paper 0 89 31
suggests 0 89 31
that 0 89 31
the 0 89 31
US 0 89 31
focus 0 89 31
on 0 89 31
Iran’s 0 89 31
many 0 89 31
ethnic 0 89 31
minority 0 89 31
groups 0 89 31
to 0 89 31
spark 0 89 31
unrest 0 89 31
and 0 89 31
an 0 89 31
eventual 0 89 31
overthrow 0 89 31
of 0 89 31
the 0 89 31
government. 0 89 31

This 0 89 32
is 0 89 32
virtually 0 89 32
the 0 89 32
same 0 89 32
road 0 89 32
map 0 89 32
that 0 89 32
the 0 89 32
US 0 89 32
has 0 89 32
followed 0 89 32
in 0 89 32
Iraq, 0 89 32
Libya, 0 89 32
Syria, 0 89 32
and 0 89 32
so 0 89 32
on. 0 89 32

The 0 89 33
results 0 89 33
have 0 89 33
been 0 89 33
unmitigated 0 89 33
disaster 1 89 33
after 1 89 33
disaster. 1 89 33

Unleashing 0 89 34
terrorists 0 89 34
on 0 89 34
Iran 0 89 34
to 0 89 34
overthrow 0 89 34
its 0 89 34
government 0 89 34
is 0 89 34
not 0 89 34
only 0 89 34
illegal 0 89 34
and 0 89 34
immoral: 0 89 34
it’s 0 89 34
also 0 89 34
incredibly 1 89 34
stupid. 1 89 34

We 0 89 35
know 0 89 35
from 0 89 35
9/11 0 89 35
that 0 89 35
blowback 0 89 35
is 0 89 35
real, 0 89 35
even 0 89 35
if 0 89 35
Giuliani 0 89 35
and 0 89 35
the 0 89 35
neocons 0 89 35
refuse 0 89 35
to 0 89 35
understand 0 89 35
it. 0 89 35

Iran 0 89 36
does 0 89 36
not 0 89 36
threaten 0 89 36
the 0 89 36
United 0 89 36
States. 0 89 36

Unlike 0 89 37
Washington’s 0 89 37
Arab 0 89 37
allies 0 89 37
in 0 89 37
the 0 89 37
region, 0 89 37
Iran 0 89 37
actually 0 89 37
holds 0 89 37
reasonably 0 89 37
democratic 0 89 37
elections 0 89 37
and 0 89 37
has 0 89 37
a 0 89 37
Western-oriented, 0 89 37
educated, 0 89 37
and 0 89 37
very 0 89 37
young 0 89 37
population. 0 89 37

Why 0 89 38
not 0 89 38
open 0 89 38
up 0 89 38
to 0 89 38
Iran 0 89 38
with 0 89 38
massive 0 89 38
amounts 0 89 38
of 0 89 38
trade 0 89 38
and 0 89 38
other 0 89 38
contacts? 0 89 38

Does 0 89 39
anyone 0 89 39
(except 0 89 39
for 0 89 39
the 0 89 39
neocons) 0 89 39
really 0 89 39
believe 0 89 39
it 0 89 39
is 0 89 39
better 0 89 39
to 0 89 39
unleash 0 89 39
terrorists 0 89 39
on 0 89 39
a 0 89 39
population 0 89 39
than 0 89 39
to 0 89 39
engage 0 89 39
them 0 89 39
in 0 89 39
trade 0 89 39
and 0 89 39
travel? 0 89 39

We 1 89 40
need 1 89 40
to 1 89 40
worry 1 89 40
about 1 89 40
blowback 1 89 40
from 1 89 40
President 1 89 40
Trump’s 1 89 40
fully-neoconized 1 89 40
Middle 1 89 40
East 1 89 40
policy! 1 89 40

That’s 1 89 41
the 1 89 41
real 1 89 41
threat! 1 89 41
