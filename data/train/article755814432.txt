Back 0 216 1
in 0 216 1
the 0 216 1
2008 0 216 1
presidential 0 216 1
race, 0 216 1
I 0 216 1
explained 0 216 1
to 0 216 1
then-candidate 0 216 1
Rudy 0 216 1
Giuliani 0 216 1
the 0 216 1
concept 0 216 1
of 0 216 1
“blowback.” 0 216 1
Years 0 216 1
of 0 216 1
US 0 216 1
meddling 0 216 1
and 0 216 1
military 0 216 1

parts 0 216 1
of 0 216 1
the 0 216 1

a 0 216 1
group 0 216 1
of 0 216 1
terrorists 0 216 1
to 0 216 1
carry 0 216 1
out 0 216 1
attacks 0 216 1
against 0 216 1
the 0 216 1
United 0 216 1
States 0 216 1
on 0 216 1
9/11. 0 216 1

They 0 216 2
didn’t 0 216 2
do 0 216 2
it 0 216 2
because 0 216 2
we 0 216 2
are 0 216 2
so 0 216 2
rich 0 216 2
and 0 216 2
so 0 216 2
free, 0 216 2
as 0 216 2
the 0 216 2
neocons 0 216 2
would 0 216 2
have 0 216 2
us 0 216 2
believe. 0 216 2

They 0 216 3
came 0 216 3
over 0 216 3
here 0 216 3
because 0 216 3
we 0 216 3
had 0 216 3
been 0 216 3
killing 0 216 3
Muslims 0 216 3
“over 0 216 3
there” 0 216 3
for 0 216 3
decades. 0 216 3

How 0 216 4
do 0 216 4
we 0 216 4
know 0 216 4
this? 0 216 4

Well, 0 216 5
they 0 216 5
told 0 216 5
us. 0 216 5

Osama 0 216 6
bin 0 216 6
Laden 0 216 6
made 0 216 6
it 0 216 6
clear 0 216 6
why 0 216 6
al-Qaeda 0 216 6
sought 0 216 6
to 0 216 6
attack 0 216 6
the 0 216 6
US. 0 216 6

They 0 216 7
didn’t 0 216 7
like 0 216 7
the 0 216 7
US 0 216 7
taking 0 216 7
sides 0 216 7
in 0 216 7
the 0 216 7
Israel-Palestine 0 216 7
conflict 0 216 7
and 0 216 7
they 0 216 7
didn’t 0 216 7

US 0 216 7
troops 0 216 7
on 0 216 7
their 0 216 7

Why 0 216 8
believe 0 216 8
a 0 216 8
terrorist, 0 216 8
some 0 216 8
responded. 0 216 8

As 0 216 9
I 0 216 9

to 0 216 9
Giuliani 0 216 9
ten 0 216 9

is 0 216 9

Unfortunately, 0 216 20
it 0 216 20
is 0 216 20
clear 0 216 20
that 0 216 20
Giuliani 0 216 20
never 0 216 20
really 0 216 20
understood 0 216 20
what 0 216 20
I 0 216 20
was 0 216 20
trying 0 216 20
to 0 216 20
tell 0 216 20
him. 0 216 20

Like 0 216 21
the 0 216 21
rest 0 216 21
of 0 216 21
the 0 216 21
neocons, 0 216 21
he 0 216 21
either 0 216 21
doesn’t 0 216 21
get 0 216 21
it 0 216 21
or 0 216 21
doesn’t 0 216 21
want 0 216 21
to 0 216 21
get 0 216 21
it. 0 216 21

In 0 216 22
a 0 216 22
recent 0 216 22
speech 0 216 22
to 0 216 22
the 0 216 22
MeK 0 216 22
– 0 216 22
a 0 216 22
violent 1 216 22
Islamist-Marxist 0 216 22
cult 0 216 22
that 0 216 22
spent 0 216 22
two 0 216 22
decades 0 216 22
on 0 216 22
the 0 216 22
US 0 216 22
terror 0 216 22
watch 0 216 22
list 0 216 22
– 0 216 22
Giuliani 0 216 22
promised 0 216 22
that 0 216 22
the 0 216 22
Trump 0 216 22
Administration 0 216 22
had 0 216 22
made 0 216 22
“regime 0 216 22
change” 0 216 22
a 0 216 22
priority 0 216 22
for 0 216 22
Iran. 0 216 22

He 0 216 23
even 0 216 23
told 0 216 23
the 0 216 23
members 0 216 23
of 0 216 23
that 0 216 23
organization 0 216 23
– 0 216 23
an 0 216 23
organization 0 216 23
that 0 216 23
has 0 216 23
killed 1 216 23
dozens 1 216 23
of 1 216 23
Americans 1 216 23
– 0 216 23
that 0 216 23
Trump 0 216 23
would 0 216 23
put 0 216 23
them 0 216 23
in 0 216 23
charge 0 216 23
of 0 216 23
Iran! 0 216 23

Giuliani 0 216 24
shares 0 216 24
with 0 216 24
numerous 0 216 24
other 0 216 24
neocons 0 216 24
like 0 216 24
John 0 216 24
Bolton 0 216 24
a 0 216 24
strong 0 216 24
relationship 0 216 24
with 0 216 24
this 0 216 24
group. 0 216 24

In 0 216 25
fact, 0 216 25
both 0 216 25
Giuliani 0 216 25
and 0 216 25
Bolton 0 216 25
have 0 216 25
been 0 216 25
on 0 216 25
the 0 216 25
payroll 0 216 25
of 0 216 25
the 0 216 25
MeK 0 216 25
and 0 216 25
have 0 216 25
received 0 216 25
tens 0 216 25
of 0 216 25
thousands 0 216 25
of 0 216 25
dollars 0 216 25
to 0 216 25
speak 0 216 25
to 0 216 25
their 0 216 25
followers. 0 216 25

This 0 216 26
is 0 216 26
another 0 216 26
example 0 216 26
of 0 216 26
how 0 216 26
foreign 0 216 26
lobbies 0 216 26
and 0 216 26
special 0 216 26
interest 0 216 26
groups 0 216 26
maintain 0 216 26
an 0 216 26
iron 0 216 26
grip 0 216 26
on 0 216 26
our 0 216 26
foreign 0 216 26
policy. 0 216 26

Does 1 216 27
anyone 1 216 27
really 1 216 27
think 1 216 27
Iran 1 216 27
will 1 216 27
be 1 216 27
better 1 216 27
off 1 216 27
if 1 216 27
Trump 1 216 27
puts 1 216 27
a 1 216 27
bunch 1 216 27
of 1 216 27
“former” 1 216 27
terrorists 1 216 27
in 1 216 27
charge 1 216 27
of 1 216 27
the 1 216 27
country? 1 216 27

How 1 216 28
did 1 216 28
that 1 216 28
work 1 216 28
in 1 216 28
Libya? 1 216 28

It’s 0 216 29
easy 0 216 29
to 0 216 29
dismiss 0 216 29
the 0 216 29
bombastic 0 216 29
Giuliani 0 216 29
as 0 216 29
he 0 216 29
speaks 0 216 29
to 0 216 29
his 0 216 29
financial 0 216 29
benefactors 0 216 29
in 0 216 29
the 0 216 29
MeK. 0 216 29

Unfortunately, 0 216 30
however, 0 216 30
Giuliani’s 0 216 30
claims 0 216 30
were 0 216 30
confirmed 0 216 30
late 0 216 30
last 0 216 30
week, 0 216 30
when 0 216 30
the 0 216 30
Washington 0 216 30
Free 0 216 30
Beacon 0 216 30
published 0 216 30
a 0 216 30
three-page 0 216 30
policy 0 216 30
paper 0 216 30
being 0 216 30
circulated 0 216 30
among 0 216 30
National 0 216 30
Security 0 216 30
Council 0 216 30
officials 0 216 30
containing 0 216 30
plans 0 216 30
to 0 216 30
spark 0 216 30
regime 0 216 30
change 0 216 30
in 0 216 30
Iran. 0 216 30

The 0 216 31
paper 0 216 31
suggests 0 216 31
that 0 216 31
the 0 216 31
US 0 216 31
focus 0 216 31
on 0 216 31
Iran’s 0 216 31
many 0 216 31
ethnic 0 216 31
minority 0 216 31
groups 0 216 31
to 0 216 31
spark 0 216 31
unrest 0 216 31
and 0 216 31
an 0 216 31
eventual 0 216 31
overthrow 0 216 31
of 0 216 31
the 0 216 31
government. 0 216 31

This 0 216 32
is 0 216 32
virtually 0 216 32
the 0 216 32
same 0 216 32
road 0 216 32
map 0 216 32
that 0 216 32
the 0 216 32
US 0 216 32
has 0 216 32
followed 0 216 32
in 0 216 32
Iraq, 0 216 32
Libya, 0 216 32
Syria, 0 216 32
and 0 216 32
so 0 216 32
on. 0 216 32

The 0 216 33
results 0 216 33
have 0 216 33
been 0 216 33
unmitigated 0 216 33
disaster 1 216 33
after 1 216 33
disaster. 1 216 33

Unleashing 0 216 34
terrorists 0 216 34
on 0 216 34
Iran 0 216 34
to 0 216 34
overthrow 0 216 34
its 0 216 34
government 0 216 34
is 0 216 34
not 0 216 34
only 0 216 34
illegal 0 216 34
and 0 216 34
immoral: 0 216 34
it’s 0 216 34
also 0 216 34
incredibly 1 216 34
stupid. 1 216 34

We 0 216 35
know 0 216 35
from 0 216 35
9/11 0 216 35
that 0 216 35
blowback 0 216 35
is 0 216 35
real, 0 216 35
even 0 216 35
if 0 216 35
Giuliani 0 216 35
and 0 216 35
the 0 216 35
neocons 0 216 35
refuse 0 216 35
to 0 216 35
understand 0 216 35
it. 0 216 35

Iran 0 216 36
does 0 216 36
not 0 216 36
threaten 0 216 36
the 0 216 36
United 0 216 36
States. 0 216 36

Unlike 0 216 37
Washington’s 0 216 37
Arab 0 216 37
allies 0 216 37
in 0 216 37
the 0 216 37
region, 0 216 37
Iran 0 216 37
actually 0 216 37
holds 0 216 37
reasonably 0 216 37
democratic 0 216 37
elections 0 216 37
and 0 216 37
has 0 216 37
a 0 216 37
Western-oriented, 0 216 37
educated, 0 216 37
and 0 216 37
very 0 216 37
young 0 216 37
population. 0 216 37

Why 0 216 38
not 0 216 38
open 0 216 38
up 0 216 38
to 0 216 38
Iran 0 216 38
with 0 216 38
massive 0 216 38
amounts 0 216 38
of 0 216 38
trade 0 216 38
and 0 216 38
other 0 216 38
contacts? 0 216 38

Does 0 216 39
anyone 0 216 39
(except 0 216 39
for 0 216 39
the 0 216 39
neocons) 0 216 39
really 0 216 39
believe 0 216 39
it 0 216 39
is 0 216 39
better 0 216 39
to 0 216 39
unleash 0 216 39
terrorists 0 216 39
on 0 216 39
a 0 216 39
population 0 216 39
than 0 216 39
to 0 216 39
engage 0 216 39
them 0 216 39
in 0 216 39
trade 0 216 39
and 0 216 39
travel? 0 216 39

We 1 216 40
need 1 216 40
to 1 216 40
worry 1 216 40
about 1 216 40
blowback 1 216 40
from 1 216 40
President 1 216 40
Trump’s 1 216 40
fully-neoconized 1 216 40
Middle 1 216 40
East 1 216 40
policy! 1 216 40

That’s 1 216 41
the 1 216 41
real 1 216 41
threat! 1 216 41
