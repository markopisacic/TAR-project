The 0
US 0
embassy 0
in 0
China 0

alert 0
Wednesday 0
after 0
a 0

government 0
employee 0
experienced 0
an 0
"abnormal" 0
sound 0
and 0
suffered 0
a 0
mild 0

-- 0
in 0
an 0
incident 0
reminiscent 0
of 0
a 0
mysterious 0
illness 0
that 0
hit 0
diplomats 0
in 0
Cuba. 0

US 0
and 0
Chinese 0
authorities 0
are 0
investigating 0
the 0
matter 0
after 0
the 0
employee, 0
who 0
was 0
assigned 0
to 0
the 0
southern 0
city 0
of 0
Guangzhou, 0
was 0
diagnosed 0
with 0
mild 0
traumatic 0
brain 0
injury 0
(MTBI), 0
said 0
embassy 0
spokeswoman 0
Jinnie 0
Lee. 0

In 0
an 0
alert 0
emailed 0
to 0
US 0
citizens 0
in 0
China, 0
the 0
embassy 0
said 0
it 0
does 0
not 0
know 0
what 0
caused 0
the 0
symptoms 0
or 0
of 0
any 0
similar 0
situations 0
in 0
the 0
country. 0

In 0
Cuba 0
last 0
year, 0
the 0
US 0
disclosed 0
that 0
24 0
diplomats 0
and 0
their 0
family 0
members 0
had 0
fallen 0
victim 0
to 0
an 0
unsolved 0
mysterious 0
attack 0
that 0
left 0
them 0
with 0
injuries 0
resembling 0
brain 0
trauma. 0

Ten 0
Canadian 0
diplomats 0
and 0
their 0
relatives 0
also 0
suffered 0
a 0
strange 0
illness. 0

"We 0
cannot 0
at 0
this 0
time 0
connect 0
it 0
with 0
what 0
happened 0
in 0
Havana 0
but 0
we 0
are 0
investigating 0
all 0
possibilities," 0
a 0
US 0
embassy 0
official 0
in 0
Beijing 0
told 0
AFP 0
on 0
the 0
condition 0
of 0
anonymity. 0

The 0
embassy's 0
health 0
alert 0
says 0
the 0
government 0
employee 0
"recently 0
reported 0
subtle 0
and 0
vague, 0
but 0
abnormal, 0
sensations 0
of 0
sound 0
and 0
pressure". 0

"The 0
US 0
government 0
is 0
taking 0
these 0
reports 0
seriously 0
and 0
has 0
informed 0
its 0
official 0
staff 0
in 0
China 0
of 0
this 0
event," 0
the 0
message 0
says. 0

US 0
and 0
Chinese 0
authorities 0
are 0
investigating 0
the 0
matter, 0
an 0
embassy 0
spokeswoman 0
said 0

"While 0
in 0
China, 0
if 0
you 0
experience 0
any 0
unusual 0
acute 0
auditory 0
or 0
sensory 0
phenomena 0
accompanied 0
by 0
unusual 0
sounds 0
or 0
piercing 0
noises, 0
do 0
not 0
attempt 0
to 0
locate 0
their 0
source. 0

Instead, 0
move 0
to 0
a 0
location 0
where 0
the 0
sounds 0
are 0
not 0
present," 0
it 0
says, 0
urging 0
people 0
with 0
medical 0
problems 0
to 0
consult 0
a 0
doctor. 0

Lee 0
said 0
the 0
employee 0
experienced 0
"a 0
variety 0
of 0
physical 0
symptoms" 0
between 0
late 0
2017 0
through 0
April 0
2018. 0

The 0
person 0
was 0
sent 0
to 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
and 0
diagnosed 0
with 0
MTBI 0
on 0
May 0
18. 0

"The 0
(State) 0
Department 0
is 0
taking 0
this 0
incident 0
very 0
seriously 0
and 0
is 0
working 0
to 0
determine 0
the 0
cause 0
and 0
impact 0
of 0
the 0
incident," 0
Lee 0
said. 0

"The 0
Chinese 0
government 0
has 0
assured 0
us 0
they 0
are 0
also 0
investigating 0
and 0
taking 0
appropriate 0
measures." 0

The 0
Chinese 0
foreign 0
ministry 0
could 0
not 0
be 0
immediately 0
reached 0
for 0

In 0
Cuba, 0
the 0
American 0
victims 0
had 0
associated 0
the 0
onset 0
of 0
their 0
symptoms 0
with 0
"unusual 0
sounds 0
or 0
auditory 0
sensations", 0
a 0
State 0
Department 0
physician 0
told 0
the 0
US 0
Senate 0
in 0
January. 0

Charles 0
Rosenfarb, 0
a 0
doctor 0
and 0
director 0
of 0
the 0
State 0
Department 0
bureau 0
of 0
medical 0
services, 0
said 0
the 0
symptoms 0
were 0
mixed 0
but 0
consistent 0
with 0
brain 0
trauma. 0

The 0
victims 0
suffered 0
headaches, 0
hearing 0
loss, 0
disorientation 0
and 0
some 0
loss 0
of 0
cognitive 0
ability. 0

Initially 0
officials 0
suspected 0
the 0
Americans 0
had 0
been 0
targeted 0
by 0
some 0
sort 0
of 0
acoustic 0
weapon, 0
although 0
in 0
public 0
senior 0
officials 0
were 0
more 0
cautious, 0
speaking 0
of 0
"health 0
attacks". 0

Media 0
reports 0
have 0
suggested 0
that 0
the 0
FBI 0
has 0
not 0
been 0
able 0
to 0
verify 0
any 0
evidence 0
to 0
support 0
the 0
sonic 0
weapon 0
theory. 0

The 0
US 0
government 0
has 0
held 0
Cuba 0
responsible, 0
arguing 0
that 0
Raul 0
Castro's 0
authoritarian 0
state 0
must 0
have 0
either 0
carried 0
out 0
the 0
assaults 0
or 0
at 0
least 0
known 0
who 0
was 0
behind 0
them. 0

The 0
incident 0
prompted 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
last 0
year 0
to 0
withdraw 0
more 0
than 0
half 0
of 0
its 0
personnel 0
at 0
the 0
embassy 0
in 0
Havana, 0
which 0
reopened 0
in 0
2015 0
as 0
the 0
two 0
nations 0
re-established 0
diplomatic 0
relations 0
that 0
had 0
ruptured 0
in 0
1961. 0

Canada 0
announced 0
last 0
month 0
that 0
it 0
was 0
bringing 0
home 0
the 0
families 0
of 0
its 0
diplomats 0
in 0
Cuba 0
after 0
a 0
year-long 0
investigation 0
into 0
the 0
illness 0
failed 0
to 0
reveal 0
a 0
cause. 0

"The 0
cause 0
(of 0
their 0
symptoms) 0
remains 0
unknown 0
but 0
could 0
be 0
human-made," 0
the 0
Canadian 0
government 0
concluded. 0

Canadian 0
and 0
US 0
authorities 0
had 0
initially 0
suspected 0
a 0
"sonic 0
attack" 0
or 0
a 0
"mass 0
psychosomatic 0
incident", 0
but 0
those 0
are 0
"now 0
considered 0
unlikely", 0
a 0
senior 0
Canadian 0
official 0
said. 0

The 0
symptoms 0
included 0
dizziness, 0
headaches 0
and 0
a 0
lack 0
of 0
ability 0
to 0
concentrate. 0

Unlike 0
their 0
American 0
counterparts, 0
however, 0
no 0
Canadian 0
envoy 0
reported 0
hearing 0
any 0
suspicious 0
sound 0
prior 0
to 0
falling 0
ill. 0
