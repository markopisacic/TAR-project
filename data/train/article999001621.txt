In 0

the 0
British 0

chief. 0

Under 0
her 0
lead 0
the 0
paper 0
took 0
a 0
new 0
direction. 0

While 1
it 1
earlier 1
made 1
attempts 1
to 1
balance 1
its 1
shoddier 1
side 1
with 1
some 1
interesting 1
reporting, 1
it 1
is 1
now 1
solidly 1
main 1
stream 1
in 1
the 1
worst 1
sense. 1

It 1
promotes 1
neo-liberalism 1
and 1
a 1
delves 1
into 1
cranky 1
identity 1
grievances 1
stories. 1

It 1
also 1
became 1
an 1
main 1
outlet 1
for 1
manipulative 1
propaganda 1
peddled 1
by 1
the 1
British 1
secret 1
services. 1

recent 1
fake 1
news 1
story 1
about 1
Paul 1
Manafort, 1
Wikileaks 1
and 1
Julian 1
Assange 1
aptly 1
demonstrates 1
this. 1

The 0
documentation 0
of 0
it 0
is 0
a 0
bit 0
lengthy 0
but 0
provides 0
that 0
it 0
was 0
a 1
willful 1
fake. 1

On 0
November 0
27 0
the 0

prepared 0
to 0

in 0

in 0

at 0

three 0

Some 0
two 0

it 0

It 0
is 0

why 0

wanted 0
to 0

what 0
was 0

the 0

A 0
well-placed 0

told 0
the 0

that 0
Manafort 0
went 0
to 0

Assange 0
around 0

Manafort, 0
69, 0
denies 0
involvement 0
in 0
the 0
hack 0
and 0
says 0
the 1
claim 1
is 1
“100% 1
false”. 1

His 0
lawyers 0
declined 0
to 0
answer 0
the 0
Guardian’s 0
questions 0
about 0
the 0
visits. 0

The 0
piece 0
did 0
not 0
include 0
the 0
public 0
denial 0
Wikileaks 0
issued 0
to 0
its 0
5.4 0
million 0
followers 0
one 0
and 0
a 0
half 0
hour 0
before 0
it 0
was 0
published. 0

The 0
Guardian 0
piece 0
came 0
at 0
a 0
critical 0
moment. 0

Currently 0
the 0
U.K. 0
and 0
Ecuador 0
conspire 0
to 0
deliver 0
Julian 0
Assange 0
to 0
U.S. 0
authorities. 0

On 0
Monday 0
special 0
counsel 0
Robert 0
Mueller 0
said 0
Manafort 0
lied 0
to 0
investigators, 0
violating 0
his 0
recent 0
plea 0
deal. 0

The 0
new 0
sensational 1
claim 1
was 0
immediately 0
picked 0
up 0
by 0
prominent 0
reporters 0
and 0
major 0
main 0
stream 0
outlets. 0

They 0
distributed 0
is 0
as 0
a 0
factual 0
account. 0

It 0
is 0
likely 0
that 0
millions 0
of 0
people 0
took 0
note 0
of 0
its 0
claim. 0

But 1
several 1
people 1
who 1
had 1
followed 1
the 1
Russiagate 1
fairytale 1
and 1
the 1
Mueller 1
investigation 1
were 1
immediately 1
suspicious 1
of 1
the 1
Guardian 1
claim. 1

The 1
story 1
was 1
weakly 1
sourced 1
and 1
included 1
some 1
details 1
that 1
seemed 1
unlikely 1
to 1
be 1
true. 1

Glenn 0
Greenwald 0
noted 0
that 0
the 0
Ecuadorian 0
embassy 0
is 0
under 0
heavy 0
CCTV 0
surveillance. 0

There 0
are 0
several 0
guards, 0
and 0
visitors 0
have 0
to 0
provide 0
their 0
identity 0
to 0
enter 0
it. 0

Every 0
visit 0
is 0
logged. 0

If 0
Manafort 0
had 0
really 0
visited 0
Assange, 0
it 0
would 0
have 0
long 0
been 0
known: 0

In 1
sum, 1
the 1
Guardian 1
published 1
a 1
story 1
today 1
that 1
it 1
knew 1
would 1
explode 1
into 1
all 1
sorts 1
of 1
viral 1
benefits 1
for 1
the 1
paper 1
and 1
its 1
reporters 1
even 1
though 1
there 1
are 1
gaping 1
holes 1
and 1
highly 1
sketchy 1
aspects 1
to 1
the 1
story. 1

Moreover, 1
the 1
main 1
author 1
of 1
the 1
story, 1
Luke 1
Harding, 1
is 1
known 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
notorious 1
fraud, 1
a 1
russo-phobe 1
intelligence 1
asset 1
with 1
a 1
personal 1
grievance 1
towards 1
Assange 1
and 1
Wikileaks. 1

A 0
year 0
ago 0

important 0
Moon 0
of 0
Alabama 0
piece 0
- 0
From 0
Snowden 0
To 0
Russia-gate 0

The 0

The 0
Media 0

Harding: 0

The 0
people 0
who 0
promote 0
the 1
"Russian 1
influence" 1
nonsense 1
are 0
political 1
operatives 1
or 1
hacks. 1

Take 1
for 1
example 1
Luke 1
Harding 1
of 1
the 1
Guardian 1
who 1
just 1
published 1
a 1
book 1
titled 1
Collusion: 1
Secret 1
Meetings, 1
Dirty 1
Money, 1
and 1
How 1
Russia 1
Helped 1
Donald 1
Trump 1
Win. 1

He 1
was 1
taken 1
apart 1
in 1
a 1
Real 1
News 1
interview 1
(vid) 1
about 1
the 1
book. 1

The 1
interviewer 1
pointed 1
out 1
that 1
there 1
is 1
absolutely 1
no 1
evidence 1
in 1
the 1
book 1
to 1
support 1
its 1
claims. 1

When 1
asked 1
for 1
any 1
proof 1
for 1
his 1
assertion 1
Harding 1
defensively 1
says 1
that 1
he 1
is 1
just 1
"storytelling" 1
- 1
in 1
other 1
words: 1
it 1
is 1
fiction. 1

Harding 1
earlier 1
wrote 1
a 1
book 1
about 1
Edward 1
Snowden 1
which 1
was 1
a 1
similar 1
sham. 1

Julian 1
Assange 1
called 1
it 1
"a 1
hack 1
job 1
in 1
the 1
purest 1
sense 1
of 1
the 1
term". 1

Harding 1
is 1
also 1
known 1
as 1
plagiarizer. 1

When 1
he 1
worked 1
in 1
Moscow 1
he 1
copied 1
stories 1
and 1
passages 1
from 1
the 1
now 1
defunct 1
Exile, 1
run 1
by 1
Matt 1
Taibbi 1
and 1
Mark 1
Ames. 1

The 1
Guardian 1
had 1
to 1
publish 1
an 1
apology. 1

The 1
new 1
Guardian 1
story 1
looked 1
like 1
another 1
weak 1
attempt 1
to 1
connect 1
the 1
alleged 1
Russian 1
malfeasance 1
with 1
Assange 1
and 1
the 1
Wikileaks 1
publishing 1
of 1
the 1
DNC 1
emails. 1

Assange 1
and 1
other 1
involved 1
people 1
deny 1
that 1
such 1
a 1
relation 1
existed. 1

There 1
is 1
no 1
public 1
evidence 1
that 1
support 1
such 1
claims. 1

Shortly 0
after 0
the 0
Guardian's 0
fake 0
news 0
story 0
went 0
public 0
Paul 0
Manafort 0
issued 0
an 0
unequivocal 0
denial: 0

“I 0
have 0
never 0
met 0
Julian 0
Assange 0
or 0
anyone 0
connected 0
to 0
him,” 0
the 0
statement 0
said. 0

“I 0
have 0
never 0
been 0
contacted 0
by 0
anyone 0
connected 0
to 0
Wikileaks, 0
either 0
directly 0
or 0
indirectly. 0

I 1
have 1
never 1
reached 0
out 0
to 0
Assange 0
or 0
Wikileaks 0
on 0
any 0
matter. 0

We 0
are 0

options 0

the 0

this 0

under 0
fire 0
from 0

journalists, 0
the 0
Guardian 0

This 0

We 0
put 0

both 0
Paul 0

representatives 0
prior 0
to 0

Neither 0
responded 0
to 0

the 0

taking 0
place. 0

We 0
have 0
since 0
updated 0
the 0
story 0
to 0
reflect 0
their 0
denials. 0

This 1
defensive 1
Guardian 1
claim 1
is, 1
like 1
its 1
story, 1
evidently 1
completely 1
false. 1

Wikileaks 1
publicly 1
denied 1
the 1
Guardian's 1
claims 1
90 1
minutes 1
before 1
the 1
story 1
was 1
first 1
published. 1

Manafort 1
asserts 1
that 1
his 1
lawyers 1
had 1
notified 1
the 1
Guardian 1
that 1
the 1
story 1
was 1
false 1
before 1
the 1
Guardian 1
'proceeded 1
with 1
the 1
story'. 1

At 0
21:05 0
utc 0
a 0
third 0
version 0
was 0
published 0
which 0
included 0
Manafort's 0
denial. 0

Half 0
an 0
hour 0
later 0
Julian 0
Assange 0
instructed 0
his 0
lawyers 0
to 0
sue 0
the 0
Guardian 0
for 0
libel. 0

Wikileaks 0
opened 0
a 0
fund 0
to 0
support 0
the 0
lawsuit. 0

A 0
day 0
after 0
the 0
Guardian 1
smear 1
piece 1
the 0
Washington 0
Times 0
reported 0
that 0
Manafort's 0
passports, 0
entered 0
into 0
evidence 0
by 0
the 0
Mueller 0
prosecution, 0
show 0
that 0
he 0
did 0
not 0
visit 0
London 0
in 0
any 0
of 0
the 0
years 0
the 0
Guardian 0
claimed 0
he 0
was 0
there 0
to 0
visit 0
Assange. 0

The 1
story 1
was 1
completely 1
false 1
and 1
the 1
Guardian 1
knew 1
it 1
was. 1

It 1
disregarded 1
and 1
left 1
out 1
the 1
denials 1
the 1
subjects 1
of 1
the 1
story 1
had 1
issued 1
before 1
it 1
was 1
published. 1

The 1

Guardian 1
has 1
become 1
a 1
main 1
outlet 1
for 1
British 1
government 1
disinformation 1
operations 1
aimed 1
at 1
defaming 1
Russia. 1

It 1
smeared 1
Assange 1
and 1
Snowden 1
as 1
Russian 1
collaborators. 1

It 1
uncritically 1
peddled 1
the 1
Russiagate 1
story 1
and 1
the 1
nonsensical 1
Skripal 1
claims 1
which 1
are 1
both 1
obviously 1
concocted 1
by 1
British 1
intelligence 1
services. 1

That 1
seems 1
to 1
have 1
become 1
its 1
main 1
purpose. 1

As 0
Disobediant 0
Media 0
notes 0
(emphasis 0
in 0
the 0
original): 0

While 1
most 1
readers 1
with 1
functional 1
critical 1
thinking 1
capacity 1
may 1
readily 1
dismiss 1
the 1
Guardian’s 1
smear 1
on 1
its 1
face, 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
the 1
Guardian 1
published 1
this 1
piece, 1
and 1
that 1
Luke 1
Harding 1
is 1
still 1
operating 1
with 1
even 1
the 1
tiniest 1
modicum 1
of 1
respect 1
as 1
a 1
journalist 1
despite 1
his 1
history 1
of 1
deceit, 1
tells 1
us 1
something 1
bone-chilling 1
about 1
journalism. 1

It 1
is 1
no 1
accident 1
that 1
Luke 1
Harding 1
is 1
still 1
employed: 1
in 1
fact, 1
it 1
is 1
because 1
of 1
Harding’s 1
consistent 1
loyalty 1
to 1
establishment, 1
specifically 1
the 1
UK 1
intelligence 1
apparatus, 1
over 1
the 1
truth 1
that 1
determines 1
his 1
“success” 1
amongst 1
legacy 1
press 1
outlets. 1

Harding 1
is 1
not 1
a 1
defacement 1
or 1
a 1
departure 1
from 1
the 1
norm, 1
but 1
the 1
personification 1
of 1
it. 1

truth 0
is 0
that 0
the 0
Guardian 0
has 0
not 0
erred 0
in 0
this 0
latest 0
story 0
attacking 0
Assange, 0
or 0
in 0
its 0
much 0
longer-running 0
campaign 0
to 1
vilify 1
him. 1

With 1
this 1
story, 1
it 1
has 1
done 1
what 1
it 1
regularly 1
does 1
when 1
supposedly 1
vital 1
western 1
foreign 1
policy 1
interests 1
are 1
at 1
stake 1
– 1
it 1
simply 1
regurgitates 1
an 1
elite-serving, 1
western 1
narrative. 1

Its 1
job 1
is 1
to 1
shore 1
up 1
a 1
consensus 1
on 1
the 1
left 1
for 1
attacks 1
on 1
leading 1
threats 1
to 1
the 1
existing, 1
neoliberal 1
order: 1
... 1

The 1
Guardian 1
did 1
not 1
make 1
a 1
mistake 1
in 1
vilifying 1
Assange 1
without 1
a 1
shred 1
of 1
evidence. 1

It 1
did 1
what 1
it 1
is 1
designed 1
to 1
do. 1

We 1
have 1
previously 1
shown 1
that 1
the 1
Guardian 1
even 1
uses 1
fascist 1
propaganda 1
tropes 1
to 1
smear 1
the 1
Russian 1
people. 1

It 1
is 1
openly 1
publishing 1
Goebbels' 1
cartoons 1
and 1
rhetoric 1
against 1
Europes 1
biggest 1
state. 1

There 1
is 1
no 1
longer 1
any 1
line 1
that 1
it 1
does 1
not 1
dare 1
to 1
cross. 1

Unfortunately 1
other 1
'western' 1
media 1
are 1
not 1
much 1
better. 1

Within 0
hours 0
of 0
being 0
published 0
the 0
Guardian 0
piece 0
was 0
debunked 0
as 0
fake 0
news. 0

That 0
did 0
not 0
hinder 0
other 0
outlets 0
to 0
add 0
to 0
its 0
smear. 1

Politico 1
allowed 1
"a 1
former 1
CIA 1
officer," 1
writing 1
under 1
a 1
pen 1
name, 1
to 1
suggest 1
- 1
without 1
any 1
evidence 1
- 1
that 1
the 1
Guardian 1
has 1
been 1
duped 1
- 1
not 1
by 1
its 1
MI5/6 1
and 1
Ecuadorian 1
spy 1
sources, 1
but 1
by 1
Russian 1
disinformation: 1

Rather 0
than 0
being 0
the 1
bombshell 1
smoking 1
gun 1
that 1
directly 1
connects 1
the 1
Trump 1
campaign 1
to 1
WikiLeaks, 1
perhaps 0
the 0
report 0
is 0
something 0
else 0
entirely: 0
a 1
disinformation 1
campaign. 1

Is 1
it 1
possible 1
someone 1
planted 1
this 1
story 1
as 1
a 1
means 1
to 1
discredit 1
the 1
journalists? 1

... 0

Harding 0
is 0
likely 0
a 0
major 0
target 0
for 0
anyone 0
wrapped 0
up 0
in 0
Russia’s 0
intelligence 0
operation 0
against 0
the 0
West’s 0
democratic 0
institutions. 0

If 0
this 0
latest 0
story 0
about 0
Manafort 0
and 0
Assange 0
is 0
false—that 0
is, 0
if, 0
for 0
example, 0
the 0
sources 0
lied 0
to 0
Harding 0
and 0
Collyns 0
(or 0
if 0
the 0

themselves 0
were 0
lied 0

and 0
thus 0
thought 0
they 0
were 0
being 0
truthful 0
in 0
their 0
statements 0
to 0
the 0
journalists), 0
or 0
if 0
the 0
Ecuadorian 0
intelligence 0
document 0
is 0
a 0
fake, 0
the 0
most 0
logical 0
explanation 0
is 0
that 0
it 0
is 0
an 0
attempt 0
to 0
make 0
Harding 0
look 0
bad. 0

The 1
is 1
zero 1
evidence 1
in 1
the 1
Politico 1
screed 1
that 1
supports 1
its 1
suggestions 1
and 1
claims. 1

It 1
is 1
fake 1
news 1
about 1
a 1
fake 1
news 1
story. 1

It 0
also 0
included 0
the 0
false 0
claim 0
that 0
Glenn 0
Greenwald 0
worked 0
with 0
Wikileaks 0
on 0
the 0
Snowden 0
papers. 0

That 0
claim 0
was 0
later 0
removed. 0

We 0
have 0
seen 0
a 0
similar 0
pattern 0
in 0
the 0
Skripal 0
affair. 0

When 0
'western' 0
intelligence 0
get 0
caught 0
in 0
spreading 0
disinformation, 0
they 0
accuse 0
Russia 0
of 0
being 0
the 0
source 0
of 0
the 0
fake. 0

Unfortunately 1
no 1
western 1
main 1
stream 1
media 1
can 1
any 1
longer 1
be 1
trusted 1
to 1
publish 1
the 1
truth. 1

The 0
Guardian 0
is 0
only 0
one 0
of 0
many 0
which 0
peddle 1
smears 1
and 0
disinformation 0
about 0
the 1
'enemies' 1
of 1
the 1
ruling 1
'western 1
interests'. 1

It 1
is 1
on 1
all 1
of 1
us 1
to 1
debunk 1
them 1
and 1
to 1
educate 1
the 1
public 1
