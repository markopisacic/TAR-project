“They 0 219 4

say 0 219 4
it 0 219 4

criminal,” 0 219 4
Saucier 0 219 4
told 0 219 4
Fox 0 219 4
News, 0 219 4
referring 0 219 4
to 0 219 4
prosecuting 0 219 4
authorities 0 219 4
in 0 219 4
his 0 219 4
case, 0 219 4
“but 0 219 4
they 0 219 4
didn’t 0 219 4
prosecute 0 219 4

Hillary 0 219 5
is 0 219 5
still 0 219 5
walking 0 219 5
free. 0 219 5

Two 0 219 6
guys 0 219 6
on 0 219 6
my 0 219 6
ship 0 219 6
did 0 219 6
the 0 219 6
same 0 219 6
thing 0 219 6
and 0 219 6
weren’t 0 219 6
treated 0 219 6
as 0 219 6
criminals. 0 219 6

We 0 219 7
want 0 219 7
them 0 219 7
to 0 219 7
correct 0 219 7
the 0 219 7
wrong.” 0 219 7

Daigle 0 219 8
said 0 219 8
that 0 219 8
a 0 219 8
notice 0 219 8
about 0 219 8
the 0 219 8
pending 0 219 8

included 0 219 8
in 0 219 8
it 0 219 8
in 0 219 8
December. 0 219 8

There 0 219 9
is 0 219 9
usually 0 219 9
a 0 219 9
six-month 0 219 9
period 0 219 9
that 0 219 9
must 0 219 9
lapse 0 219 9
before 0 219 9
the 0 219 9
lawsuit 0 219 9
actually 0 219 9
is 0 219 9
filed. 0 219 9

“We’ll 0 219 10
highlight 0 219 10
the 0 219 10
differences 0 219 10
in 0 219 10
the 0 219 10
way 0 219 10
Hillary 0 219 10
Clinton 0 219 10
was 0 219 10
prosecuted 0 219 10
and 0 219 10
how 0 219 10
my 0 219 10
client 0 219 10
was 0 219 10
prosecuted,” 0 219 10
Daigle 0 219 10
said. 0 219 10

“We’re 0 219 11
seeking 0 219 11
to 0 219 11
cast 0 219 11
a 0 219 11
light 0 219 11
on 0 219 11
this 0 219 11
to 0 219 11
show 0 219 11
that 0 219 11
there’s 0 219 11
a 0 219 11
two-tier 0 219 11
justice 0 219 11
system 0 219 11
and 0 219 11
we 0 219 11
want 0 219 11
it 0 219 11
to 0 219 11
be 0 219 11
corrected.” 0 219 11

While 0 219 12
campaigning, 0 219 12
and 0 219 12
after 0 219 12
taking 0 219 12
office, 0 219 12
Trump 0 219 12
frequently 0 219 12
voiced 0 219 12
support 0 219 12
for 0 219 12
Saucier, 0 219 12
who 0 219 12
in 0 219 12
March 0 219 12
became 0 219 12
the 0 219 12
second 0 219 12
person 0 219 12
he 0 219 12
pardoned. 0 219 12

Trump 0 219 13
often 0 219 13
compared 0 219 13
the 0 219 13
Obama 0 219 13
administration’s 0 219 13
handling 0 219 13
of 0 219 13
Saucier’s 0 219 13
case 0 219 13
with 0 219 13
that 0 219 13
of 0 219 13
Clinton. 0 219 13

Saucier, 0 219 14
who 0 219 14
lives 0 219 14
in 0 219 14
Vermont, 0 219 14
pleaded 0 219 14
guilty 0 219 14
in 0 219 14
2016 0 219 14
to 0 219 14
taking 0 219 14
photos 0 219 14
inside 0 219 14
the 0 219 14
USS 0 219 14

in 0 219 14
Groton, 0 219 14
Connecticut, 0 219 14
in 0 219 14
2009. 0 219 14

He 0 219 15
said 0 219 15
he 0 219 15
only 0 219 15
wanted 0 219 15
service 0 219 15
mementos, 0 219 15
but 0 219 15
federal 0 219 15
prosecutors 0 219 15
argued 0 219 15
he 0 219 15
was 0 219 15
a 0 219 15
disgruntled 0 219 15
sailor 0 219 15
who 0 219 15
had 0 219 15
put 0 219 15
national 0 219 15
security 0 219 15
at 0 219 15
risk 0 219 15
by 0 219 15
taking 0 219 15
photos 0 219 15
showing 0 219 15
the 0 219 15
submarine's 0 219 15
propulsion 0 219 15
system 0 219 15
and 0 219 15
reactor 0 219 15
compartment 0 219 15
and 0 219 15
then 0 219 15
obstructed 0 219 15
justice 0 219 15
by 0 219 15
destroying 0 219 15
a 0 219 15
laptop 0 219 15
and 0 219 15
camera. 0 219 15

Saucier 0 219 16
said 0 219 16
that 0 219 16
he 0 219 16
recognized 0 219 16
he 0 219 16
had 0 219 16
erred 0 219 16
in 0 219 16
taking 0 219 16
the 0 219 16
photos, 0 219 16
which 0 219 16
he 0 219 16
said 0 219 16
he 0 219 16
wanted 0 219 16
to 0 219 16
show 0 219 16
only 0 219 16
to 0 219 16
his 0 219 16
family 0 219 16
to 0 219 16
show 0 219 16
them 0 219 16
where 0 219 16
he 0 219 16
worked. 0 219 16

But 0 219 17
he 0 219 17
lashed 0 219 17
out 0 219 17
at 0 219 17
Obama 0 219 17
officials, 0 219 17
saying 0 219 17
that 0 219 17
his 0 219 17
prosecution 0 219 17
was 0 219 17
politically 0 219 17
motivated, 0 219 17
prompted 0 219 17
by 0 219 17
sensitivity 0 219 17
about 0 219 17
classified 0 219 17
information 0 219 17
amid 0 219 17
the 0 219 17
scandal 0 219 17
involving 0 219 17
Clinton's 0 219 17
emails. 0 219 17

“My 0 219 18
case 0 219 18
was 0 219 18
usually 0 219 18
something 0 219 18
handled 0 219 18
by 0 219 18
military 0 219 18
courts,” 0 219 18
he 0 219 18
said. 0 219 18

“They 1 219 19
used 1 219 19
me 1 219 19
as 1 219 19
an 1 219 19
example 1 219 19
because 1 219 19
of 1 219 19
[the 1 219 19
backlash 1 219 19
over] 1 219 19
Hillary 1 219 19
Clinton.” 1 219 19

Saucier, 0 219 20
31, 0 219 20
said 0 219 20
that 0 219 20
the 0 219 20
pardon 0 219 20
has 0 219 20
enabled 0 219 20
him 0 219 20
to 0 219 20
pick 0 219 20
up 0 219 20
the 0 219 20
pieces 0 219 20
and 0 219 20
rebuild 0 219 20
his 0 219 20
life 0 219 20
with 0 219 20
his 0 219 20
wife 0 219 20
and 0 219 20
young 0 219 20
daughter. 0 219 20

A 0 219 21
felony 0 219 21
conviction 0 219 21
left 0 219 21
him 0 219 21
scrambling 0 219 21
to 0 219 21
find 0 219 21
work; 0 219 21
he 0 219 21
finally 0 219 21
landed 0 219 21
a 0 219 21
job 0 219 21
collecting 0 219 21
garbage. 0 219 21

Now, 0 219 22
he 0 219 22
works 0 219 22
on 0 219 22
design 0 219 22
and 0 219 22
engineering 0 219 22
projects 0 219 22
for 0 219 22
an 0 219 22
industrial 0 219 22
boiler 0 219 22
company. 0 219 22

“Things 0 219 23
are 0 219 23
starting 0 219 23
to 0 219 23
go 0 219 23
in 0 219 23
the 0 219 23
right 0 219 23
direction,” 0 219 23
Saucier 0 219 23
said. 0 219 23

“I 0 219 24
work 0 219 24
with 0 219 24
a 0 219 24
group 0 219 24
of 0 219 24
really 0 219 24
great 0 219 24
people, 0 219 24
I 0 219 24
get 0 219 24
to 0 219 24
use 0 219 24
my 0 219 24
skills 0 219 24
set.” 0 219 24

Because 0 219 25
of 0 219 25
the 0 219 25
loss 0 219 25
of 0 219 25
income 0 219 25
during 0 219 25
his 0 219 25
imprisonment, 0 219 25
as 0 219 25
well 0 219 25
as 0 219 25
earning 0 219 25
below 0 219 25
his 0 219 25
potential 0 219 25
when 0 219 25
he 0 219 25
collected 0 219 25
garbage, 0 219 25
he 0 219 25
and 0 219 25
his 0 219 25
wife 0 219 25
Sadie 0 219 25
lost 0 219 25
their 0 219 25
home 0 219 25
to 0 219 25
foreclosure. 0 219 25

Debt 0 219 26
collectors 0 219 26
called 0 219 26
and 0 219 26
his 0 219 26
cars 0 219 26
were 0 219 26
repossessed. 0 219 26

“With 0 219 27
a 0 219 27
pardon 0 219 27
there’s 0 219 27
no 0 219 27
magic 0 219 27
wand 0 219 27
that 0 219 27
that 0 219 27
gets 0 219 27
waved 0 219 27
and 0 219 27
makes 0 219 27
everything 0 219 27
right,” 0 219 27
he 0 219 27
said, 0 219 27
“But 0 219 27
I 0 219 27
try 0 219 27
to 0 219 27
stay 0 219 27
positive 0 219 27
and 0 219 27
look 0 219 27
forward.” 0 219 27

He 0 219 28
praises 0 219 28
the 0 219 28
pardons 0 219 28
that 0 219 28
Trump 0 219 28
has 0 219 28
granted, 0 219 28
and 0 219 28
takes 0 219 28
exception 0 219 28
at 0 219 28
the 0 219 28
criticism. 0 219 28

“The 0 219 29
Obama 0 219 29
administration 0 219 29
singled 0 219 29
out 0 219 29
Dinesh 0 219 29
for 0 219 29
things 0 219 29
most 0 219 29
people 0 219 29
don’t 0 219 29
even 0 219 29
get 0 219 29

Saucier 0 219 29
said. 0 219 29

“President 0 219 30
Trump 0 219 30
noticed 0 219 30
that 0 219 30
my 0 219 30

was 0 219 30
exemplary 0 219 30

that 0 219 30
