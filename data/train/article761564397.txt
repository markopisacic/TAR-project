“They 0 237 4

my 0 237 4
case 0 237 4
to 0 237 4
say 0 237 4
it 0 237 4
was 0 237 4
criminal,” 0 237 4
Saucier 0 237 4
told 0 237 4
Fox 0 237 4
News, 0 237 4
referring 0 237 4
to 0 237 4
prosecuting 0 237 4
authorities 0 237 4
in 0 237 4
his 0 237 4
case, 0 237 4
“but 0 237 4
they 0 237 4
didn’t 0 237 4
prosecute 0 237 4
Hillary 0 237 4

Hillary 0 237 5
is 0 237 5
still 0 237 5
walking 0 237 5
free. 0 237 5

Two 0 237 6
guys 0 237 6
on 0 237 6
my 0 237 6
ship 0 237 6
did 0 237 6
the 0 237 6
same 0 237 6
thing 0 237 6
and 0 237 6
weren’t 0 237 6
treated 0 237 6
as 0 237 6
criminals. 0 237 6

We 0 237 7
want 0 237 7
them 0 237 7
to 0 237 7
correct 0 237 7
the 0 237 7
wrong.” 0 237 7

Daigle 0 237 8
said 0 237 8
that 0 237 8
a 0 237 8
notice 0 237 8
about 0 237 8
the 0 237 8
pending 0 237 8

included 0 237 8
in 0 237 8
it 0 237 8
in 0 237 8
December. 0 237 8

There 0 237 9
is 0 237 9
usually 0 237 9
a 0 237 9
six-month 0 237 9
period 0 237 9
that 0 237 9
must 0 237 9
lapse 0 237 9
before 0 237 9
the 0 237 9
lawsuit 0 237 9
actually 0 237 9
is 0 237 9
filed. 0 237 9

“We’ll 0 237 10
highlight 0 237 10
the 0 237 10
differences 0 237 10
in 0 237 10
the 0 237 10
way 0 237 10
Hillary 0 237 10
Clinton 0 237 10
was 0 237 10
prosecuted 0 237 10
and 0 237 10
how 0 237 10
my 0 237 10
client 0 237 10
was 0 237 10
prosecuted,” 0 237 10
Daigle 0 237 10
said. 0 237 10

“We’re 0 237 11
seeking 0 237 11
to 0 237 11
cast 0 237 11
a 0 237 11
light 0 237 11
on 0 237 11
this 0 237 11
to 0 237 11
show 0 237 11
that 0 237 11
there’s 0 237 11
a 0 237 11
two-tier 0 237 11
justice 0 237 11
system 0 237 11
and 0 237 11
we 0 237 11
want 0 237 11
it 0 237 11
to 0 237 11
be 0 237 11
corrected.” 0 237 11

While 0 237 12
campaigning, 0 237 12
and 0 237 12
after 0 237 12
taking 0 237 12
office, 0 237 12
Trump 0 237 12
frequently 0 237 12
voiced 0 237 12
support 0 237 12
for 0 237 12
Saucier, 0 237 12
who 0 237 12
in 0 237 12
March 0 237 12
became 0 237 12
the 0 237 12
second 0 237 12
person 0 237 12
he 0 237 12
pardoned. 0 237 12

Trump 0 237 13
often 0 237 13
compared 0 237 13
the 0 237 13
Obama 0 237 13
administration’s 0 237 13
handling 0 237 13
of 0 237 13
Saucier’s 0 237 13
case 0 237 13
with 0 237 13
that 0 237 13
of 0 237 13
Clinton. 0 237 13

Saucier, 0 237 14
who 0 237 14
lives 0 237 14
in 0 237 14
Vermont, 0 237 14
pleaded 0 237 14
guilty 0 237 14
in 0 237 14
2016 0 237 14
to 0 237 14
taking 0 237 14
photos 0 237 14
inside 0 237 14
the 0 237 14
USS 0 237 14

it 0 237 14
was 0 237 14
stationed 0 237 14
in 0 237 14
Groton, 0 237 14
Connecticut, 0 237 14
in 0 237 14
2009. 0 237 14

He 0 237 15
said 0 237 15
he 0 237 15
only 0 237 15
wanted 0 237 15
service 0 237 15
mementos, 0 237 15
but 0 237 15
federal 0 237 15
prosecutors 0 237 15
argued 0 237 15
he 0 237 15
was 0 237 15
a 0 237 15
disgruntled 0 237 15
sailor 0 237 15
who 0 237 15
had 0 237 15
put 0 237 15
national 0 237 15
security 0 237 15
at 0 237 15
risk 0 237 15
by 0 237 15
taking 0 237 15
photos 0 237 15
showing 0 237 15
the 0 237 15
submarine's 0 237 15
propulsion 0 237 15
system 0 237 15
and 0 237 15
reactor 0 237 15
compartment 0 237 15
and 0 237 15
then 0 237 15
obstructed 0 237 15
justice 0 237 15
by 0 237 15
destroying 0 237 15
a 0 237 15
laptop 0 237 15
and 0 237 15
camera. 0 237 15

Saucier 0 237 16
said 0 237 16
that 0 237 16
he 0 237 16
recognized 0 237 16
he 0 237 16
had 0 237 16
erred 0 237 16
in 0 237 16
taking 0 237 16
the 0 237 16
photos, 0 237 16
which 0 237 16
he 0 237 16
said 0 237 16
he 0 237 16
wanted 0 237 16
to 0 237 16
show 0 237 16
only 0 237 16
to 0 237 16
his 0 237 16
family 0 237 16
to 0 237 16
show 0 237 16
them 0 237 16
where 0 237 16
he 0 237 16
worked. 0 237 16

But 0 237 17
he 0 237 17
lashed 0 237 17
out 0 237 17
at 0 237 17
Obama 0 237 17
officials, 0 237 17
saying 0 237 17
that 0 237 17
his 0 237 17
prosecution 0 237 17
was 0 237 17
politically 0 237 17
motivated, 0 237 17
prompted 0 237 17
by 0 237 17
sensitivity 0 237 17
about 0 237 17
classified 0 237 17
information 0 237 17
amid 0 237 17
the 0 237 17
scandal 0 237 17
involving 0 237 17
Clinton's 0 237 17
emails. 0 237 17

“My 0 237 18
case 0 237 18
was 0 237 18
usually 0 237 18
something 0 237 18
handled 0 237 18
by 0 237 18
military 0 237 18
courts,” 0 237 18
he 0 237 18
said. 0 237 18

“They 1 237 19
used 1 237 19
me 1 237 19
as 1 237 19
an 1 237 19
example 1 237 19
because 1 237 19
of 1 237 19
[the 1 237 19
backlash 1 237 19
over] 1 237 19
Hillary 1 237 19
Clinton.” 1 237 19

Saucier, 0 237 20
31, 0 237 20
said 0 237 20
that 0 237 20
the 0 237 20
pardon 0 237 20
has 0 237 20
enabled 0 237 20
him 0 237 20
to 0 237 20
pick 0 237 20
up 0 237 20
the 0 237 20
pieces 0 237 20
and 0 237 20
rebuild 0 237 20
his 0 237 20
life 0 237 20
with 0 237 20
his 0 237 20
wife 0 237 20
and 0 237 20
young 0 237 20
daughter. 0 237 20

A 0 237 21
felony 0 237 21
conviction 0 237 21
left 0 237 21
him 0 237 21
scrambling 0 237 21
to 0 237 21
find 0 237 21
work; 0 237 21
he 0 237 21
finally 0 237 21
landed 0 237 21
a 0 237 21
job 0 237 21
collecting 0 237 21
garbage. 0 237 21

Now, 0 237 22
he 0 237 22
works 0 237 22
on 0 237 22
design 0 237 22
and 0 237 22
engineering 0 237 22
projects 0 237 22
for 0 237 22
an 0 237 22
industrial 0 237 22
boiler 0 237 22
company. 0 237 22

“Things 0 237 23
are 0 237 23
starting 0 237 23
to 0 237 23
go 0 237 23
in 0 237 23
the 0 237 23
right 0 237 23
direction,” 0 237 23
Saucier 0 237 23
said. 0 237 23

“I 0 237 24
work 0 237 24
with 0 237 24
a 0 237 24
group 0 237 24
of 0 237 24
really 0 237 24
great 0 237 24
people, 0 237 24
I 0 237 24
get 0 237 24
to 0 237 24
use 0 237 24
my 0 237 24
skills 0 237 24
set.” 0 237 24

Because 0 237 25
of 0 237 25
the 0 237 25
loss 0 237 25
of 0 237 25
income 0 237 25
during 0 237 25
his 0 237 25
imprisonment, 0 237 25
as 0 237 25
well 0 237 25
as 0 237 25
earning 0 237 25
below 0 237 25
his 0 237 25
potential 0 237 25
when 0 237 25
he 0 237 25
collected 0 237 25
garbage, 0 237 25
he 0 237 25
and 0 237 25
his 0 237 25
wife 0 237 25
Sadie 0 237 25
lost 0 237 25
their 0 237 25
home 0 237 25
to 0 237 25
foreclosure. 0 237 25

Debt 0 237 26
collectors 0 237 26
called 0 237 26
and 0 237 26
his 0 237 26
cars 0 237 26
were 0 237 26
repossessed. 0 237 26

“With 0 237 27
a 0 237 27
pardon 0 237 27
there’s 0 237 27
no 0 237 27
magic 0 237 27
wand 0 237 27
that 0 237 27
that 0 237 27
gets 0 237 27
waved 0 237 27
and 0 237 27
makes 0 237 27
everything 0 237 27
right,” 0 237 27
he 0 237 27
said, 0 237 27
“But 0 237 27
I 0 237 27
try 0 237 27
to 0 237 27
stay 0 237 27
positive 0 237 27
and 0 237 27
look 0 237 27
forward.” 0 237 27

He 0 237 28
praises 0 237 28
the 0 237 28
pardons 0 237 28
that 0 237 28
Trump 0 237 28
has 0 237 28
granted, 0 237 28
and 0 237 28
takes 0 237 28
exception 0 237 28
at 0 237 28
the 0 237 28
criticism. 0 237 28

“The 0 237 29
Obama 0 237 29
administration 0 237 29
singled 0 237 29
out 0 237 29
Dinesh 0 237 29
for 0 237 29
things 0 237 29
most 0 237 29
people 0 237 29
don’t 0 237 29
even 0 237 29
get 0 237 29
charged 0 237 29

Saucier 0 237 29
said. 0 237 29

“President 0 237 30
Trump 0 237 30
noticed 0 237 30
that 0 237 30
my 0 237 30
career 0 237 30
was 0 237 30
exemplary 0 237 30

that 0 237 30
