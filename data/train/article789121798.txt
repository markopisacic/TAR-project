- 0
Here's 0
Why 0

If 0
you 0
don’t 0
like 0
President 0
Trump 0
and 0
can’t 0
understand 0
how 0
anyone 0
could, 0
look 0
no 0
further 0
than 0
the 0
past 0
week 0
for 0
an 0
excellent 0
example 0
of 0
what 1
on 1
Earth 1
could’ve 0
made 0
a 1
man 1
promising 1
to 1
Drain 1
the 1
Swamp 1
so 0
popular. 0

The 0
Washington 0
establishment 0
politicians 0
act 1
like 1
children 1
when 0
they 0
can’t 0
have 0
their 0
way. 0

They 1
kick 1
and 1
scream 1
and 1
lie 1
and 1
pout. 1

President 1
Trump 1
is 1
the 1
anti-politician 1
and 0
when 0
Congress 0
continues 0
to 0
behave 0
like 0
this, 0
he 0
only 0
gets 0
more 0
popular. 0

President 0
Trump 0
nominated 0
Bret 0
Kavanaugh 0
to 0
the 0
supreme 0
court. 0

He’s 0
a 0
pro-life 1
judge 1
and 0
his 0
vote 0
will 0
certainly 0
tip 0
the 0
scales 0
of 0
justice 0
to 0
the 0
right. 0

The 0
power 0
that 0
the 0
Supreme 0
Court 0
has, 0
some 0
would 0
argue, 0
is 0
greater 0
in 0
certain 0
aspects 0
than 0
that 0
of 0
the 0
president 0
himself. 0

Perhaps 0
that’s 0
why 0
the 0
2016 0
election 0
loss 0
was 0
so 0
devastating 1
to 0
the 0
Democrats. 0

Trump 0
potentially 0
has 0
the 0
ability 0
to 0
nominate 0
3 0
Supreme 0
Court 0
justices 0
during 0
his 0
presidency, 0
thus 0
shaping 0
the 0
laws 0
and 0
morals 0
of 0
this 0
country 0
for 0
about 0
the 0
next 0
30 0
years. 0

Personally, 1
I 1
trust 1
very, 1
very 1
few 1
politicians 1
no 1
matter 1
the 1
party 1
that 1
they 1
claim. 1

So, 0
when 0
a 1
bunch 1
of 1
well-documented 1
liars 1
come 0
out 0
with 0
yet 0
another 0
sexual 0
assault 0
allegation 0
against 0
a 0
Trump 0
appointee, 0
let’s 0
just 0
say 0
I’m 0
skeptical 0
and 0
here’s 0

Timing 0

The 0
most 0
suspicious 0
part 0
of 0
this 0
whole 0
situation 0
is 0
the 0
timing. 0

Christine 0
Ford 0
recalled 0
the 0
incident 0
in 0
2006 0

She's 0
known 0
about 0
this 0
for 0
over 0
ten 0
years, 0
why 0
come 0
forward 0
now? 0

She's 0
affiliated 0
with 0
the 0
democratic 0
party 0
and 0
the 0
“resist” 0
movement 0

She 0
hired 0
a 0
Clinton 0
attorney, 0
Lisa 0
Banks 0

She 0
can 0
produce 0
exactly 0
zero 0
witnesses 0

Any 0
one 0
of 0
these 0
(and 0
dozens 0
of 0
other) 0
circumstances 0
by 0
themselves 0
are 0
not 0
enough 0
to 0
dismiss 0
this 0
allegation 0
outright. 0

However, 0
taken 1
together 1
as 1
a 1
whole, 1
it’s 1
far 1
too 1
suspicious 1
to 1
lend 1
it 1
any 1
credibility. 1

Ladies, 0
you 0
demand 0
to 0
be 0
believed, 0
no 0
matter 0
what. 0

Well, 0
when 0
every 1
time 1
there's 1
a 1
man 1
that 1
you 1
don't 1
like 1
running 1
for 1
public 1
office 1
or 1
being 1
nominated 1
for 1
a 1
position, 1
some 1
woman 1
crawls 1
out 1
from 1
a 1
line 1
of 1
protesters 1
and 1
makes 1
an 1
ambiguous-at-best 1
claim 1
about 1
unwanted 1
sexual 1
advances, 1
it 0
becomes 0
increasingly 0
difficult 0
to 0
take 0
you 0
seriously. 0

No, 0
an 0
accusation 0
against 0
a 0
man 0
who 0
has 0
been 0
investigated 0
by 0
the 0
FBI 0
six 0
times 0
prior 0
and 0
has 0
75 0
women 0
publicly 0
vouching 0
for 0
his 0
character 0
is 0
not 0
going 0
to 0
stop 0
this 0
process. 0

And 0
guess 0
what, 0
next 1
time 1
a 1
man 1
is 1
nominated 1
to 1
a 1
position 1
who 1
really 1
has 1
committed 1
a 1
crime, 1
people 1
will 1
be 1
that 1
much 1
less 1
likely 1
to 1
believe 1
his 1
accuser. 1

Way 1
to 1
go! 1

By 0
attempting 0
to 0
derail 0
this 0
process 0
with 0
such 1
a 1
pathetic 1
attempt 1
at 1
a 1
smear 1
campaign, 1
you 0
have 0
successfully 0
made 0
it 0
much 0
easier 0
for 0
a 0
real 0
sex 0
offender 0
to 0
point 0
back 0
at 0
this 0
and 0
say, 0
“look, 0
this 0
is 0
what 0
they 0
do"! 0

Women 1
everywhere 1
should 1
be 1
furious. 1

As 0
an 0
outsider, 0
a 0
regular 1
Joe 1
American, 1
this 0
is 0
what 0
I 0
see: 0
Trump 0
nominates 0
a 0
very 0
well 0
known, 0
well-established 0
judge 0
to 0
the 0
supreme 0
court. 0

Immediately 0
every 0
Democrat 0
publicly 0
stated 0
that 0
they 0
would 0
vote 0
No 0
for 0
his 0
confirmation. 0

On 0
the 0
other 0
hand, 0
every 0
Republican 0
publicly 0
stated 0
that 0
they 0
would 0
vote 0
Yes. 0

Currently, 0
there's 0
more 0
Republicans 0
in 0
Congress 0
than 0
Democrats, 0
which 0
means 0
the 0
guy 0
will 0
be 0
confirmed. 0

There's 0
an 0
election 0
2 0
months 0
away. 0

The 0
Democrats 0
think 0
that 0
they'll 0
take 0
back 0
the 0
majority 0
of 0
Congress 0
and 0
will 0
thus 0
be 0
able 0
to 0
block 0
Trump's 0
nomination. 0

All 0
they 0
have 0
to 0
do 0
is 0
delay 0
the 0
confirmation 0
until 0
after 0
the 0
election. 0

So, 0
they 1
dig 1
up 1
some 1
Trump-hating 1
woman 1
from 1
Kavanaugh’s 1
past 1
and 1
convince 1
her 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
he 1
assaulted 1
her 1
thinking 1
that 1
such 1
an 1
allegation 1
will 1
surely 1
delay 1
the 1
vote 1
long 1
enough 1
for 1
them 1
to 1
regain 1
control 1
of 1
Congress. 1

It’s 0
not 0
difficult 0
to 0
see 0
through 0
this 0
plan. 0

These 0
are 0
the 0
facts. 0

This 0
is 0
not 0
my 0
opinion. 0

Everything 1
else 1
is 1
just 1
noise. 1
