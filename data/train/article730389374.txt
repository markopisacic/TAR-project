Friday 0
night, 0
a 0
drone, 0
apparently 0
modeled 0
on 0
a 0
U.S. 0
drone 0
that 0
fell 0
into 0
Iran's 0
hands, 0
intruded 0
briefly 0
into 0
Israeli 0
airspace 0
over 0
the 0
Golan 0
Heights, 0
and 0
was 0
shot 0
down 0
by 0
an 0
Apache 0
helicopter. 0

Israel 0
seized 0
upon 0
this 0
to 0
send 0
F-16s 0
to 0
strike 0
the 0
airfield 0
whence 0
the 0
drone 0
originated. 0

Returning 0
home, 0
an 0
F-16 0
was 0
hit 0
and 0
crashed, 0
unleashing 0
the 0
most 0
devastating 0
Israeli 0
attack 0
in 0
decades 0
on 0
Syria. 0

Monday's 0
headline 0
on 0
The 0

Journal 0

page 0
blared: 0

"The 0
Pentagon 0
and 0
State 0
Department 0
have 0
already 0
condemned 0
Iran 0
and 0
thrown 0
their 0
support 0
behind 0
Israel. 0

The 0
question 0
now 0
is 0
whether 0
the 0
Trump 0
administration 0
will 0
go 0
further. 0

... 0
Secretary 0
of 0
State 0
Rex 0
Tillerson 0
(has) 0
affirmed 0
that 0
the 0
U.S. 0
seeks 0
not 0
only 0
to 0
ensure 0
its 0
allies' 0
security 0
but 0
to 0
deny 0
Iran 0
its 0
'dreams 0
of 0
a 0
northern 0
arch' 0
from 0
Tehran 0
to 0
Beirut. 0

A 0
good 0
way 0
to 0
achieve 0
both 0
objectives 0
would 0
be 0
back 0
Israel's 0
response 0
to 0
Iran's 0
aggression--now 0
and 0
in 0
the 0
future." 0

Chagai 0
Tzuriel 0
, 0
who 0
heads 0
the 0
Israeli 0
Ministry 0
of 0
Intelligence, 0
echoed 0
the 0
FDD: 0
"If 1
you 1
(Americans) 1
are 1
committed 1
to 1
countering 1
Iran 1
in 1
the 1
region, 1
then 1
you 1
must 1
do 1
so 1
in 1
Syria--first." 1

Our 0
orders 0
have 0
been 0
cut. 0

Iran 0
has 0
dismissed 0
as 0
"lies" 1
and 1
"ridiculous" 1
the 0
charge 0
that 0
it 0
sent 0
the 0
drone 0
into 0
Israeli 0
airspace. 0

If 0
Tehran 0
did, 0
it 0
would 0
be 0
an 0
act 0
of 0
monumental 1
stupidity. 1

Not 0
only 0
did 0
the 0
drone 0
bring 0
devastating 0
Israeli 0
reprisals 0
against 0
Syria 0
and 0
embarrass 0
Iran's 0
ally 0
Russia, 0
it 0
brought 0
attacks 0
on 0
Russian-provided 0
and 0
possibly 0
Russian-manned 0
air 0
defenses. 0

Moreover, 0
in 0
recent 0
months 0
Iranian 0
policy--suspending 0
patrol 0
boat 0
harassment 0
of 0
U.S. 0
warships--appears 0
crafted 0
to 0
ease 0
tensions 0
and 0
provide 0
no 0
new 0
causes 0
for 0
Trump 0
to 0
abandon 0
the 0
nuclear 0
deal 0
Prime 0
Minister 0
Hassan 0
Rouhani 0
regards 0
as 0
his 0
legacy. 0

Indeed, 0
why 0
would 0
Iran, 0
which, 0
with 0
Assad, 0
Russia 0
and 0
Hezbollah, 0
is 0
among 0
the 0
victors 0
in 0
Syria's 0
six-year 0
civil 0
war, 0
wish 0
to 0
reignite 0
the 0
bloodletting 0
and 0
bring 0
Israeli 0
and 0
U.S. 0
firepower 0
in 0
on 0
the 0
other 0
side? 0

In 0
Syria's 0
southeast, 0
another 0
incident 0
a 0
week 0
ago 0
may 0
portend 0
an 0
indefinite 0
U.S. 0
stay 0
in 0
that 0
broken 0
and 0
bleeding 0
country. 0

To 0
recapture 0
oil 0
fields 0
lost 0
in 0
the 0
war, 0
forces 0
backed 0
by 0
Assad 0
crossed 0
the 0
Euphrates 0
into 0
territory 0
taken 0
from 0
ISIS 0
by 0
the 0
U.S. 0
and 0
our 0
Kurd 0
allies. 0

The 0
U.S. 0
response 0
was 0
a 0
barrage 0
of 0
air 0
and 0
artillery 0
strikes 0
that 0
killed 0
100 0
soldiers. 0

What 0
this 0
signals 0
is 0
that, 0
though 0
ISIS 0
has 0
been 0
all 0
but 0
evicted 0
from 0
Syria, 0
the 0
U.S. 0
intends 0
to 0
retain 0
that 0
fourth 0
of 0
Syria 0
as 0
a 0
bargaining 1
chip 1
in 0
negotiations. 0

In 0
the 0
northwest, 0
Turkey 0
has 0
sent 0
its 0
Syrian 0
allies 0
to 0
attack 0
Afrin 0
and 0
President 0
Recep 0
Tayyip 0
Erdogan 0
has 0
threatened 0
Manbij, 0
80 0
miles 0
to 0
the 0
east, 0
where 0
U.S. 0
troops 0
commingle 0
with 0
the 0
Kurd 0
defenders 0
and 0
U.S. 0
generals 0
were 0
visible 0
last 0
week. 0

Midweek, 0
Erdogan 1
exploded: 1
"(The 0
Americans) 0
tell 0
us, 0
'Don't 0
come 0
to 0
Manbij.' 0

We 0
will 0
come 0
to 0
Manbij 0
to 0
hand 0
over 0
these 0
territories 0
to 0
their 0
rightful 0
owners." 0

The 0
U.S. 0
and 0
Turkey, 0
allies 0
for 0
six 0
decades, 0
with 0
the 0
largest 0
armies 0
in 0
NATO, 0
may 0
soon 0
be 0
staring 0
down 0
each 0
other's 0
gun 0
barrels. 0

Has 1
President 1
Trump 1
thought 1
through 1
where 1
we 1
are 1
going 1
with 1
this 1
deepening 1
commitment 1
in 1
Syria, 1
where 0
we 0
have 0
only 0
2,000 0
troops 0
and 0
no 0
allies 0
but 0
the 0
Kurds, 0
while 0
on 0
the 0
other 0
side 0
is 0
the 0
Syrian 0
army, 0
Hezbollah, 0
Russia 0
and 0
Iran, 0
and 0
Shiite 0
militias 0
from 0
Iraq, 0
Afghanistan 0
and 0
Pakistan? 0

Clearly, 0
we 0
have 0
an 0
obligation 0
not 0
to 0
abandon 0
the 0
Kurds, 0
who 0
took 0
most 0
of 0
the 0
casualties 0
in 0
liberating 0
eastern 0
Syria 0
from 0
ISIS. 0

And 0
we 0
have 0
a 0
strategic 0
interest 0
in 0
not 0
losing 0
Turkey 0
as 0
an 0
ally. 0

But 0
this 0
calls 0
for 0
active 1
diplomacy, 1
not 1
military 1
action. 1

And 0
now 0
that 0
the 0
rebels 0
have 0
been 0
defeated 0
and 0
the 0
civil 0
war 0
is 0
almost 0
over, 0
what 0
would 0
be 0
the 0
cost 0
and 0
what 0
would 0
be 0
the 0
prospects 0
of 0
fighting 0
a 0
new 0
and 0
wider 0
war? 0

What 0
would 0
victory 0
look 0
like? 0

Bibi 0
and 0
the 0
FDD 0
want 0
to 0
see 0
U.S. 0
power 0
deployed 0
alongside 0
that 0
of 0
Israel, 0
against 0
Iran, 0
Assad 0
and 0
Hezbollah. 0

But 0
while 0
Israel's 0
interests 0
are 0
clear, 0
what 1
would 1
be 1
the 1
U.S. 1
vital 1
interest? 1

What 1
outcome 1
would 1
justify 1
another 1
U.S. 1
war 1
in 1
a 1
region 1
where 1
all 1
the 1
previous 1
wars 1
in 1
this 1
century 1
have 1
left 1
us 1
bleeding, 1
bankrupt, 1
divided 1
and 1
disillusioned? 1

When 1
he 1
was 1
running 1
, 1
Donald 1
Trump 1
seemed 1
to 1
understand 1
this. 1
