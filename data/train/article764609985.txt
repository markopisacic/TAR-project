At 0
the 0

the 0

Horowitz 0
was 0

in 0

However, 0
the 0
Inspector 0
General 0
left 0
the 0
door 0
open 0
to 0
the 0
possibility 0
that 0
political 0
bias 0
did 0
indeed 0
play 0
a 0
role, 0
as 0
his 0
current 0
investigation 0
in 0
the 0
Russia-Collusion 0
probe 0
of 0
the 0

While 0
the 0

refuses 0
to 0

conclusively 0
that 0
political 0
bias 0
was 0
the 0
animus 0
behind 0
the 0
FBI’s 0
handling 0

it 0
also 0
indicates 0
that 0

may 0
have 0
more 0
to 0
say 0
about 0
the 0
FBI’s 0
political 0
leanings 0
in 0
his 0
Russia 0
report. 0

The 0
Washington 0
Post 0
explains: 0

The 0
Justice 0
Department 0
inspector 0
general 0
on 0
Thursday 0
castigated 0
former 0
FBI 0
Director 0
James 0
B. 0
Comey 0
for 0
his 0
actions 0
during 0
the 0
Hillary 0
Clinton 0
email 0
investigation 0
and 0
found 0
that 0
other 0
senior 0
bureau 0
officials 0
showed 0
a 0
“willingness 0
to 0
take 0
official 0
action” 0
to 0
prevent 0
Donald 0
Trump 0
from 0
becoming 0
president… 0
Some 0
senior 0
bureau 0
officials, 0
the 0
report 0
found, 0
exhibited 0
a 0
disturbing 1
“willingness 0
to 0
take 0
official 0
action” 0
to 0
hurt 0
Trump’s 0
chances 0
to 0
become 0
president. 0

Perhaps 0
the 0
most 0
damaging 1
new 0
revelation 0
in 0
the 0
report 0
is 0
a 0
previously-unreported 0
text 0
message 0
in 0
which 0
Peter 1
Strzok, 1
a 1
key 1
investigator 1
on 1
both 1
the 1
Clinton 1
email 1
case 1
and 1
the 1
investigation 1
of 1
Russia 1
and 1
the 1
Trump 1
campaign, 1
assured 1
an 1
FBI 1
lawyer 1
in 1
August 1
2016 1
that 1
“we’ll 1
stop” 1
Trump 1
from 1
making 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
White 1
House. 1

“[Trump’s] 0
not 0
ever 0
going 0
to 0
become 0
president, 0
right? 0

Right? 0

!” 0
the 0
lawyer, 0
Lisa 0
Page, 0
wrote 0
to 0
Strzok. 0

“No. 0

No 0
he 0
won’t. 0

We’ll 0
stop 0
it,” 0
Strzok 0
responded… 0

The 0
inspector 0
general 0
concluded 0
that 0
Strzok’s 0
text, 0
along 0
with 0
others 0
disparaging 1
Trump, 0
“is 0
not 0
only 0
indicative 0
of 0
a 0
biased 0
state 0
of 0
mind 0
but, 0
even 0
more 0
seriously, 0
implies 0
a 0
willingness 0
to 0
take 0
official 0
action 0
to 0
impact 0
the 0
presidential 0
candidate’s 0
electoral 0
prospects.” 0

The 0
messages 0
“potentially 0
indicated 0
or 0
created 0
the 0
appearance 0
that 0
investigative 0
decisions 0
were 0
impacted 0
by 0
bias 0
or 0
improper 0
considerations,” 0
the 0
inspector 0
general 0
wrote… 0

Strzok 0
has 0
argued 0
that 0
he 0
was 0
just 0
trying 0
to 0
reassure 0
Page 0
that 0
Trump 0
couldn’t 0
win, 0
and 0
that 0
he 0
wasn’t 0
implying 0
that 0
they 0
would 0
take 0
action 0
to 0
stop 0
his 0
election. 0

But 0
it 0
wasn’t 0
just 0
Page 0
and 0
Strzok, 0
there 0
were 0
FIVE 1
other 0
investigators 0
on 0
the 0
Clinton 0
case 0
who 0
expressed 0
overtly 0
political 0
views 0
in 0
support 0
of 0
Clinton 0
and/or 0
against 0
Trump… 0
DURING 1
the 0
investigation. 0

Page 0
and 0
Strzok 0
are 0
not 0
the 0
only 0
FBI 0
officials 0
assigned 0
to 0
the 0
Clinton 0
email 0
probe 0
who 0
were 0
found 0
to 0
have 0
exchanged 0
personal 0
messages 0
indicating 0
either 0
an 0
animus 0
against 0
Trump 0
or 0
frustration 0
with 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
the 0
FBI 0
was 0
investigating 0
Clinton. 0

The 0
report 0
identified 0
five 0
officials 0
with 0
some 0
connection 0
to 0
the 0
email 0
probe 0
who 0
were 0
expressing 0
political 0
views, 0
faulting 0
them 0
for 0
having 0
brought 0
“discredit 0
to 0
themselves, 0
sowed 0
doubt 0
about 0
the 0
FBI’s 0
handling 0
of 0
the 0
midyear 0
investigation, 0
and 0
impacted 0
the 0
reputation 0
of 0
the 0
FBI.” 0
The 0
midyear 0
investigation 0
refers 0
to 0
the 0
Clinton 0
email 0
probe. 0

“The 0
messages 0
cast 0
a 0
cloud 0
over 0
the 0
FBI 0
investigations 0
to 0
which 0
these 0
employees 0
were 0
assigned,” 0
Horowitz 0
alleged. 0

“Ultimately 0
the 0
consequences 0
of 0
these 0
actions 0
impact 0
not 0
only 0
the 0
senders 0
of 0
these 0
messages 0
but 0
also 0
other 0
who 0
worked 0
on 0
these 0
investigation 0
and, 0
indeed, 0
the 0
entire 0
FBI.” 0

The 0
IG 0
also 0
found 0
that 0
the 0
FBI 0
moved 0
slowly 0
on 0
new 0
evidence 0
that 0
could 0
have 0
damned 1
Hillary 0
Clinton, 0
and 0
did 0
so 0
for 0
reasons 0
that 0
make 0
no 0
sense. 0

The 0
report 0
took 0
particular 0
aim 0
at 0
FBI 0
officials 0
investigating 0
Clinton’s 0
email 0
server 0
for 0
moving 0
slowly 0
after 0
agents 0
in 0
the 0
New 0
York 0
Field 0
office 0
discovered 0
messages 0
on 0
the 0
laptop 0
of 0
disgraced 1
former 0
Congressman 0
Anthony 0
Weiner 0
that 0
might 0
be 0
relevant 0
to 0
their 0
case. 0

By 0
no 0
later 0
than 0
September 0
29, 0
the 0
inspector 0
general 0
alleged, 0
the 0
bureau 0
had 0
learned 0
“virtually 0
every 0
fact” 0
it 0
would 0
cite 0
as 0
justification 0
late 0
the 0
next 0
month 0
to 0
search 0
Weiner’s 0
laptop 0
for 0
messages 0
of 0
Clinton 0
and 0
top 0
aide 0
Huma 0
Abedin. 0

The 0
inspector 0
general 0
derided 0
the 0
bureau’s 0
reasons 0
for 0
not 0
moving 0
more 0
quickly 0
— 0
that 0
agents 0
were 0
waiting 0
for 0
additional 0
information 0
from 0
New 0
York, 0
that 0
they 0
couldn’t 0
move 0
without 0
a 0
warrant 0
and 0
that 0
investigators 0
were 0
more 0
focused 0
on 0
the 0
Russia 0
case 0
— 0
as 0
“unpersuasive,” 1
“illogical,” 1
and 1
inconsistent 1
with 0
their 0
assertion 0
that 0
they 0
would 0
leave 0
no 0
stone 0
unturned 0
on 0
Clinton. 0

The 0
report 0
also 0
faulted 0
the 0
bureau 0
for 0
assigning 0
essentially 0
the 0
same 0
personnel 0
to 0
the 0
Russia 0
and 0
Clinton 0
teams, 0
and 0
singled 0
out 0
Strzok, 0
suggesting 0
his 0
anti-Trump 0
views 0
might 0
have 0
played 0
a 0
role 0
in 0
his 0
not 0
acting 0
more 0
expeditiously 0
on 0
the 0
new 0
lead. 0

“Under 0
these 0
circumstances, 0
we 1
did 1
not 1
have 1
confidence 1
that 1
Strzok’s 1
decision 1
to 1
prioritize 1
the 1
Russia 1
investigation 1
over 1
following 1
up 1
on 1
the 1
Midyear-related 1
investigative 1
lead 1
discovered 1
on 1
the 1
Weiner 1
laptop 1
was 1
free 1
from 1
bias,” 1
the 0
report 0
said. 0

Did 0
you 0
get 0
that? 0

IG 0
Horowitz 0
can’t 0
prove 0
it, 0
but 0
he’s 0
not 0
sure 0
that 0
Strzok 0
wasn’t 0
acting 0
in 0
a 0
politically 0
biased 0
manner 0
when 0
he 0
slow-played 0
the 0
Clinton 0
investigation 0
while 0
moving 0
more 0
quickly 0
on 0
the 0
Russia 0
investigation. 0

How 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
can 1
we 1
trust 1
them 1
even 0
as 0
they 0
express 0
bias 0
while 0
investigating 0
malfeasance? 0

We 0
see 0
this 0
kind 0
of 0
corruption 0
all 0
over 0
the 0
world, 0
why 0
should 0
believe 0
that 0
these 0
officials 0
could 0
be 0
immune 0
to 0
acting 0
on 0
their 0
personal 0
biases? 0

There 0
were 0
7 0
of 0
them 0
on 0
the 0
case, 0
and 0
they 0
were 0
comfortable 0
enough 0
with 0
each 0
other 0
to 0
express 0
their 0
biases 0
openly 0
and 0
none 0
of 0
them 0
ever 0
chastised 0
the 0
others 0
for 0
expressing 0
those 0
biases! 0

Not 0
only 0
that, 0
the 0
team 0
that 0
handled 0
Clinton’s 0
investigation 0
so 0
poorly 0
was 0
almost 0
the 0
identical 0
team 0
that 0
was 0
then 0
assigned 0
to 0
handle 0
the 0
Russia 0
investigation! 0

Meaning, 0
the 0
obviously 0
politically 0
biased 0
team 0
that 0
had 0
just 0
cleared 0
the 0
woman 0
that 0
they 0
supported, 0
was 0
now 0
tapped 0
to 0
investigate 0
if 0
the 0
man 0
that 0
they 0
hated 0
was 0
tied 0
to 0
Russian 0
corruption. 0

This 0
is 0
INSANE. 1

Meanwhile, 0
another 0
story 0
just 0
breaking 0
at 0
Fox 0
News 0
provides 0
even 0
more 0
evidence 0
that 0
Peter 0
Strzok 0
is 0
the 0
big 1
bad 1
guy 1
in 0
the 0
FBI 0
mess. 1

Not 0
only 0
was 0
he 0
slow-playing 0
the 0
Clinton 0
investigation, 0
he 0
may 0
be 0
the 0
only 0
reason 0
she 0
was 0
never 0
charged 0
with 0
a 0
crime. 0

In 0
a 0
newly 0
released 0
FBI 0
email, 0
we 0
learned 0
that 0
“foreign 0
actors” 0
gained 0
at 0

some 0
access 0
to 0
Hillary 0
Clinton’s 0
unsecure 0

highly 0
anticipated 0
report 0
on 0

Clinton 0

case 0
later 0
Thursday. 0

The 0
House 0
committees, 0
which 0
conducted 0
a 0
joint 0
probe 0
into 0
decisions 0
made 0
by 0
the 0

in 0
2016 0

addressed 0

in 0

“Documents 0

question: 0

email 0
about 0
Clinton 0
emails 0

on 0
Scribd 0

The 0
email 0
came 0
from 0
FBI 0
agent 0
Peter 0
Strzok 0
and 0
it’s 0
the 0
first 0
place 0
we 0
see 0
the 0
question 0
of 0
whether 0
or 0
not 0
Clinton 0
can 0
be 0
found 0
as 0
“grossly 1
negligent,” 1
in 0
the 0
handling 0
of 0
classified 0
intel. 0

Remember, 0
Strzok 0
is 0
widely 0
credited 0
as 0
the 0
man 0
who 0
changed 0
FBI 0
Director 0
Comey’s 0
language 0
on 0
the 0
Clinton 0
email 0
investigation 0
from 0
the 0
prosecutable 0
“grossly 1
negligent” 1
to 0
the 0
legally 0
superflous 0
“extremely 1
careless.” 1

At 0
HotAir.com 0
John 0
Sexton 0
explains 0
the 0
importance 0
of 0
this 0
discovery: 0

In 0
the 0
FBI 0
memo, 0
you 0
can 0
already 0
see 0
the 0
genesis 0
of 0
the 0
distinction 0
the 0
FBI 0
would 0
rely 0
on 0
to 0
clear 0
Clinton. 0

Strzok 0
writes 0
that 0
the 0
media 0
has 0
been 0
focused 0
on 0
the 0
question 0
of 0
why 0
Hillary 0
seems 0
to 0
be 0
getting 0
a 0
pass 0
when 0
“Petraeus/Berger/Libby” 0
did 0
not. 0

He 0
writes, 0
“We 0
draw 0
the 0
distinction 0
in 0
noting 0
we 0
have 0
no 0
evidence 0
classified 0
information 0
was 0
ever 0
shared 0
with 0
an 0
unauthorized 0
party, 0
i.e. 0

notwithstanding 0
the 0
server 0
setup, 0
we 0
have 0
not 0
seen 0
classified 0
information 0
shared 0
with 0
a 0
member 0
of 0
the 0
media, 0
an 0
agent 0
of 0
a 0
foreign 0
power, 0
a 0
lover, 0
etc.” 0
In 0
other 0
words, 0
Hillary 0
may 0
have 0
been 0
hacked 0
but 0
she 0
didn’t 0
intentionally 0
give 0
anything 0
away. 0

Of 0
course, 0
the 0
statute 0
itself 0
didn’t 0
make 0
intent 0
a 0
prerequisite. 0

Herridge 0
reports 0
that 0
the 0
House 0
committee 0
memo 0
once 0
again 0
raises 0
this 0
same 0
issue: 0
“Officials 0

stating 0
Secretary 0
Clinton 0
lacked 0
the 0
requisite 0
‘intent’ 0
for 0
charges 0
to 0
be 0
filed,” 0
the 0
memo 0
says, 0
before 0
pointing 0
to 0
statements 0
by 0
Comey 0
that 0
indicated 0
a 0
belief 0
that 0
intent 0
was 0
required 0
— 0
which 0
the 0
memo 0
says 0
ignored 0
“meaningful 0
aspects” 0
of 0
the 0
law. 0

It 0
really 0
does 0
seem 0
that 0
Strzok, 0
an 0
agent 0
who 0
had 0
a 0
personal 0
pro-Hillary 0
bias, 0
was 0
the 0
person 0
who 0
pushed 0
to 0
let 0
her 0
off 0
the 0
hook 0
by 0
focusing 0
on 0
her 0
intent 0
rather 0
than 0
her 0
negligence 0
setting 0
up 0
the 0
server 0
in 0
the 0
first 0
place. 0

I 1
fully 1
believe 1
IG 1
Horowitz’ 1
findings 1
here. 0

I 0
believe 0
that 0
he 0
was 0
unable 0
to 0
prove 0
that 0
there 0
was 0
any 0
political 0
motive 0
to 0
the 0
FBI’s 0
handling 0
of 0
the 0
Clinton 0
email 0
case, 0
and 0
I 0
believe 0
that 0
while 0
the 0
case 0
was 0
obviously 0
mishandled, 1
it 0
could 0
have 0
reached 0
the 0
conclusion 0
it 0
did 0
honorably. 0

However, 0
I 0
also 0
think 0
that 0
the 0
IG 0
has 0
purposely 0
left 0
room 0
in 0
his 0
conclusion 0
to 0
amend 0
that 0
decision 0
after 0
he’s 0
concluded 0
his 0
Russia 0
investigation. 0

In 0
fact, 0
there 0
are 0
already 0
signs 0
of 0
him 0
doing 0
that 0
in 0
this 0
report. 0

Much 0
of 0
the 0
information 0
that 0
he 0
uses 0
to 0
chastise 0
Strzok’s 0
behavior 0
and 0
judgment 0
in 0
the 0
Clinton 0
email 0
case, 0
would 0
have 0
actually 0
come 0
from 0
his 0
current 0
investigation 0
into 0
the 0
Russia 0
mess. 0

It’s 0
quite 0
possible 0
that 0
as 0
bad 0
as 0
this 0
report 0
is 0
for 0
Comey, 0
Strzok, 0
Page, 0
and 0
Obama’s 0
FBI 0
leadership… 0
Horowitz’ 0
conclusion 0
in 0
the 0
Russia 0
investigation 0
could 0
prove 0
to 0
be 0
even 1
worse. 1

We’ll 0
see. 0
