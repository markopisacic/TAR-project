3D-Printed 0
Gun 0
Plans 0

In 0
July, 0
I 0
reported 0
that 0
the 0
Department 0
of 0
Justice 0
finally 0
settled 0
with 0
Cody 0
Wilson 0
and 0
Defense 0
Distributed 0
over 0
his 0
3D-print 0
gun 0
plans 0
being 0
lawful. 0

The 0
DOJ 0
surrendered 0
in 0
the 0
matter 0
and 0
accepted 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
the 0
plans 0
are 0
protected 0
under 0
the 0
First 0
Amendment. 0

However, 0
a 0
federal 0
judge, 0
in 0
a 0
lawsuit 0
brought 0
by 0
eight 0
states 0
and 0
the 0
District 0
of 0
Columbia, 0
has 0
blocked 0
the 0
plans 0
from 0
being 0
released. 0

The 0
judge 0
should 0
understand 0
that 0
these 0
plans 0
are 0
protected 0
under 0
the 0
First 0
Amendment 0
in 0
the 0
same 0
way 0
that 0
any 0
other 0
printed 0
material 0
is, 0
and 0
that 0
there 0
is 0
no 0
crime 0
that 0
has 0
been 0
committed 0
by 0
making 0
them 0
available 0
to 0
people 0
online. 0

Second, 0
if 0
that 0
were 0
not 0
enough, 0
we 0
already 0
know 0
that 0
the 0
Second 0
Amendment 0
protects 0
actual 0
arms 0
from 0
restriction 0
and 0
the 0
right 0
to 0
keep 0
and 0
bear 0
them 0
from 0
infringement. 0

U.S. 0

Robert 0

a 0

a 0

to 0
reverse 0
the 0
decision 0
letting 0
Defense 0

publish 0
the 0

Trump 0
said 0
Tuesday 0
that 0
he's 0
"looking 0

the 0
idea, 0
saying 0
making 0
3D 0
plastic 0

available 0

"doesn't 0

serious? 1

Why, 0
yes, 0
yes 0
they 0
are 0
serious. 0

Deadly 1
serious. 0

It 0

when 0
you 0
have 0
the 0
same 0
people 0
who 0
have 1
absolutely 1
no 1

with 0

murder 1
their 0
babies 0
in 0
their 0
wombs 0
in 0
the 0
most 1
brutal 1
and 1
barbaric 1
fashion, 0
and 0
then 0
sell 0
off 0
their 0
body 0
parts 0
for 0
profit, 0
if 0
they 0
don't 0
throw 0
them 0
in 0
the 0

them 0
down 0

The 0
eight 0
states 0
are 0
the 0
usual 0
suspects, 0
along 0
with 0
the 0
District 0
of 0

we 0
should 0
note 0

claims 0
the 0
settlement 0
is: 0

...in 0
violation 0
of 0
the 0
Administrative 0
Procedure 0
Act....there 0
is 0
no 0
indication 0
in 0
the 0
settlement 0
agreement 0
or 0
elsewhere 0
that 0
any 0
analysis, 0
study 0
or 0
determination 0
was 0
made 0
by 0
the 0
government 0
defendants 0
in 0
consultation 0
with 0
other 0
agencies, 0
before 0
the 0
federal 0
government 0
agreed 0
to 0
lift 0
export 0
controls 0
on 0
the 0
downloadable 0
guns. 0

In 0
fact, 0
the 0
agreement 0
states 0
that 0
it 0
"does 0
not 0
reflect 0
any 0
agreed-upon 0
purpose 0
other 0
than 0
the 0
desire 0
of 0
the 0

to 0

and 0
to 0
resolve 0
the 0
Action 0
without 0
the 0
time 0
and 0
expense 0
of 0
further 0
litigation." 0

The 0
lawsuit 0
also 0
argues 0
the 0
settlement 0
violates 0
the 0
Tenth 0
Amendment 0
by 0
infringing 0
on 0
states' 0
rights 0
to 0
regulate 0
firearms. 0

Washington 0
has 0
a 0
robust 0
regulatory 0
system 0
meant 0
to 0
keep 0
firearms 0
out 0
of 0
the 0
hands 0
of 0
dangerous 0
individuals. 0

That 0
system 0
is 0
jeopardized 0
by 0
the 0
Trump 0
Administration's 0
action 0
and 0
will 0
be 0
undermined 0
by 0
the 0
distribution 0
of 0
Defense 0
Distributed's 0
downloadable 0
guns. 0

Note 0
that 0
Ferguson 0
forgets 0
that 0
the 0
Tenth 0
Amendment 0
states 0
plainly: 0

The 0
powers 0
not 0
delegated 0
to 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
by 0
the 0
Constitution, 0
nor 0
prohibited 0
by 0
it 0
to 0
the 0
States, 0
are 0
reserved 0
to 0
the 0
States 0
respectively, 0
or 0
to 0
the 0
people. 0

(emphasis 0
mine) 0

Since 0
our 0
founders 0
clearly 0
said 0
that 0
our 0
rights 0
come 0
from 0
our 0
Creator, 0
and 0
the 0
Second 0
Amendment 0
acknowledges 0
that 0
the 0
"right 0
of 0
the 0
people 0
to 0
keep 0
and 0
bear 0
arms 0
shall 0
not 0
be 0
infringed," 0
I 0
truly 0
wonder 0
where 0
he 0
gets 0
this 0
idea 0
the 0
state 0
has 0
a 0
right 0
to 0
do 0
just 0
that, 0
infringe 1
on 1
the 1
rights 1
of 1
the 1
people 1
by 1
regulating 1
firearms. 1

he 0
is 0
reading 0
something 0
into 0
it 0
that 0
is 0
simply 0
not 0
there, 0
but 0
that's 0
a 0
Communist 1
ideology 0
you 0
are 0
seeing 0
there, 0
not 0
an 0
American 1
one. 0

Reason 0
reports 0
on 0
the 0
response 0
of 0
Defense 0
Distributed: 0

Josh 0
Blackman, 0
one 0
of 0
Defense 0
Distributed's 0
lawyers, 0
said 0
in 0
an 0
email 0
today 0
that 0
"The 0
District 0
Court 0
in 0
Washington 0
already 0
approved 0
the 0
settlement. 0

This 0
latest 0
suit 0
is 0
another 0
collateral 0
attack 0
on 0
a 0
rule-making 0
process 0
that 0
began 0
in 0
the 0
Obama 0
Administration." 0

As 0
reported 0
yesterday, 0
Defense 0
Distributed 0
is 0
already 0
embroiled 0
in 0
its 0
own 0
lawsuit 0
against 0
New 0
Jersey 0
and 0
Los 0
Angeles 0
over 0
those 0
authorities' 0
threats, 0
and 0
simultaneously 0
is 0
fighting 0
Pennsylvania's 0
request 0
for 0
a 0
temporary 0
restraining 0
order 0
against 0
them. 0

(Both 0
those 0
states 0
are 0
also 0
part 0
of 0
today's 0
federal 0
lawsuit 0
filed 0
in 0
the 0
Western 0
District 0
of 0
Washington.) 0

While 0
the 0
various 0
court 0
filings 0
about 0
this 0
continue 0
to 0
suggest 0
that 0
August 0
1 0
is 0
the 0
date 0
on 0
which 0
Defense 0
Distributed 0
will 0
begin 0
distributing 0
the 0
files—which, 0
again, 0
the 0
settlement 0
legally 0
permits 0
them 0
to 0
do—the 0
distribution 0
is 0
already 0
happening. 0

Cody 0
Wilson 0
of 0
Defense 0
Distributed 0
is 0
already 0
fundraising 0
off 0
the 0
suit 0
via 0
Twitter. 0

He 0
told 0
me 0
five 0
years 0
ago, 0
when 0
I 0
was 0
writing 0
a 0
feature 0
story 0
on 0
the 0
beginnings 0
of 0
his 0
fight 0
with 0
the 0
government 0
over 0
gun-making 0
files, 0
that 0
"This 0
has 0
been 0
a 0
continuous 0
process 0
of 0
different 0
levels 0
of 0
authority 0
figures 0
trying 0
to 0
stop 0
it 0
from 0
happening 0
and 0
thus 0
allowing 0
it 0
to 0
happen...Of 0
course 0
we 0
are 0
going 0
to 0
succeed—because 0
you 0
all 0
are 0
trying 0
to 0
stop 0
me. 0

That 0
seemed 0
natural 0
and 0
ended 0
up 0
being 0
true." 0

So 0
far, 0
that 0
has 0
continued 0
to 0
be 0
true. 0

This 1
federal 1
judge 1
should 1
know 1
what 1
the 1
Constitution 1
actually 1
says 1
and 0
should 0
have 0
tossed 0
this 0
frivolous 1
lawsuit 0
in 0
the 0
trash 0
where 0
it 0
belongs. 0

Instead, 0
he 0
is 0
demonstrating 0
he 0
is 0
not 1
even 1
fit 1
to 1
sit 1
on 1
the 1
bench, 1
and 0
the 0
attorney 0
generals 0
of 0
each 0
of 0
these 0
states 0
are 0
demonstrating 0
they 0
are 0
not 1
fit 1
to 1
be 1
in 1
the 1

they 0
are 0
in. 0

Speaking 0
of 0
Defense 0

and 0
Cody 0
Wilson, 0
enter 0
to 0

this 0
Ghost 0
