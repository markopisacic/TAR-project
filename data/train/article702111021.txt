At 0 50 9
a 0 50 9
Friday 0 50 9
hearing, 0 50 9
Saris 0 50 9
expressed 0 50 9
concern 0 50 9
that 0 50 9
ICE 0 50 9
had 0 50 9
broken 0 50 9
its 0 50 9
word 0 50 9
with 0 50 9
Rombot 0 50 9
after 0 50 9
telling 0 50 9
him 0 50 9
in 0 50 9
2015 0 50 9
that 0 50 9
he 0 50 9
would 0 50 9
"be 0 50 9
given 0 50 9
an 0 50 9
opportunity 0 50 9
to 0 50 9
prepare 0 50 9

an 0 50 9
orderly 0 50 9
departure" 0 50 9
before 0 50 9
being 0 50 9
deported. 0 50 9

She 0 50 10
also 0 50 10
expressed 0 50 10
concern 0 50 10
he 0 50 10
was 0 50 10
being 0 50 10
held 0 50 10
alongside 0 50 10
potentially 0 50 10
violent 0 50 10
criminals. 0 50 10

Her 0 50 11
problem 0 50 11
though 0 50 11
was 0 50 11
that 0 50 11
the 0 50 11
law 0 50 11
and 0 50 11
precedent 0 50 11
are 0 50 11
on 0 50 11
the 0 50 11
side 0 50 11
of 0 50 11
the 0 50 11
continued 0 50 11
deportation 0 50 11
of 0 50 11
aliens. 0 50 11

Kritarch 0 50 12
Saris 0 50 12
has 0 50 12
apparently 0 50 12
seen 0 50 12
the 0 50 12
SCOTUS 0 50 12
writing 0 50 12
on 0 50 12
the 0 50 12
wall, 0 50 12
and 0 50 12
perhaps 0 50 12
had 1 50 12
an 1 50 12
attack 1 50 12
of 1 50 12
her 1 50 12
legal 1 50 12
conscience 1 50 12
and 0 50 12
decided 0 50 12
that 0 50 12
she 0 50 12
will 0 50 12
acquiesce 0 50 12
on 0 50 12
the 0 50 12
major 0 50 12
issue, 0 50 12
but 0 50 12
fight 0 50 12
on 0 50 12
a 0 50 12
minor 0 50 12
issue. 0 50 12

Commonly 0 50 13
this 0 50 13
the 0 50 13
pattern 0 50 13
of 0 50 13
Judges 0 50 13
who 0 50 13
don't 0 50 13

Saris 0 50 14
has 0 50 14
apparently 0 50 14
decided 0 50 14
to 0 50 14
bend 0 50 14
to 0 50 14
the 0 50 14
inevitable 0 50 14
in 0 50 14
the 0 50 14
case 0 50 14
of 0 50 14
Indonesians, 0 50 14
who 0 50 14
had 0 50 14
years 0 50 14
of 0 50 14
hearings 0 50 14
and 0 50 14
appeals, 0 50 14
all 0 50 14
to 0 50 14
naught, 0 50 14
but 0 50 14
do 0 50 14
a 0 50 14
little 0 50 14
sabotage 0 50 14
instead.However, 0 50 14
she 1 50 14
will 1 50 14
not 1 50 14
let 1 50 14
it 1 50 14
go 1 50 14
quietly 1 50 14
into 1 50 14
the 1 50 14
night.What 1 50 14
we 0 50 14
have 0 50 14
here 0 50 14
is 0 50 14
that 0 50 14
Saris 0 50 14
realized 0 50 14
she 0 50 14
has 0 50 14
no 0 50 14
authority 0 50 14
over 0 50 14
the 0 50 14
deportation 0 50 14
of 0 50 14
illegal 1 50 14
aliens, 1 50 14
but 0 50 14
she 0 50 14
will 0 50 14
do 0 50 14
her 0 50 14
best 0 50 14
to 0 50 14
throw 1 50 14
a 1 50 14
wrench 1 50 14
in 0 50 14

to 0 50 14

illegal 1 50 14
aliens 1 50 14
released 0 50 14
from 0 50 14

so 0 50 14
they 0 50 14

into 0 50 14

not 0 50 14
