Et 0
Tu, 0
Benedict? 0
(Some 0
Final 0
Thoughts 0
on 0
Joseph 0
Ratzinger) 0

Recently 0

an 0
editor 0
of 0
a 0
“conservative” 0
Catholic 0
magazine 0
asked 0
me 0
if 0
I 0
would 0
be 0
interested 0
in 0
contributing 0
a 0
piece 0
about 0
the 0
resignation 0
of 0
Pope 0
Benedict 0
XVI, 0
five 0
years 0
on. 0

I 0
declined, 0
telling 0
him 0
that 0
I 0
was 0
morally 0
certain 0
that 0
anything 0
I 0
had 0
to 0
say 0
about 0
it 0
would 0
not 0
be 0
in 0
keeping 0
with 0
his 0
editorial 0
policies. 0

It’s 0
been 0
five 0
years, 0
and 0
I’ve 0
noticed 0
that 0
there 0
are 0
a 0
lot 0
fewer 0
people 0
talking 0
about 0
what 0
a 0
“courageous” 0
act 0
it 0
was 0
to 0
give 0
up 0
the 0
pontificate. 0

The 0
consequences 0
of 0
that 0
act 0
have 0
been 0
so 1
outlandish 1
– 0
even 0
for 0
people 0
who 0
are 0
mostly 0
OK 0
with 0
Francis 0
– 0
that 0
very 0
few 0
people 0
are 0
still 0
willing 0
to 0
make 0
polite 0
noises 0
about 0
it. 0

Editor's 0
Note: 0
In 0
a 0
March 0
11th 0
letter 0
signed 0
by 0
Pope 0
Emeritus 0
Benedict 0
XVI 0
and 0
addressed 0
to 0
Msgr. 0

Dario 0
Vigano, 0
prefect 0
of 0
the 0
Secretariat 0
for 0
Communications, 0
the 0
former 0
pope 0
reportedly 0
offers 0
an 0
impassioned 1
defense 1
of 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
against 0
the 0
claim 0
that 0
he 0
lacks 0
theological 0
and 0
philosophical 0
formation. 0

In 0
no 0
uncertain 0
terms, 0
this 0
letter, 0
bearing 0
Benedict's 0
signature, 0
affirms 0
that 0
“there 0
is 0
an 0
internal 0
continuity 0
between 0
the 0
two 0
pontificates.” 0
Whether 0
Benedict 0
actually 0
wrote 0
this 0
letter 0
or 0
not, 0
it 0
gives 0
rise 0
to 0
a 0
number 0
of 0
grave 1
questions 1
that 0
need 0
to 0
be 0
answered 0
rather 0
urgently 0
before 0
history 0
closes 0
the 0
book 0
on 0
this 0
commedia 1
diabolica. 1

Our 0
thanks 0
to 0
Remnant 0
columnist, 0
Hilary 0
White, 0
for 0
addressing 0
the 0
most 0
pertinent 0
of 0
these 0
here 0
below. 0

MJM 0

In 0
fact, 0
five 0
years 0
after 0
the 0
resignation 0
of 0
Pope 0
Benedict 0
the 0
Catholic 0
faithful 0
mostly 0
want 0
to 0
know 0
why; 0
why 0
would 0
a 0
pope 0
– 0
a 0
man 0
with 0
decades 0
of 0
up-close-and-personal 0
experience 0
of 0
the 0
“filth” 1
in 0
the 0
Curia 0
and 0
throughout 0
the 0
church 0
– 0
suddenly 0
just 0
decide 0
to 0
quit? 0

Why 0
would 0
he 0
choose 0
to 0
walk 0
away 0
knowing 0
that 0
his 0
task 0
was 0
not 0
completed? 0

At 0
the 0
time 0
and 0
since 0
then, 0
particularly 0
in 0
light 0
of 0
what 0
has 0
been 0
happening, 0
it 0
seems 0
one 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
bizarre 1
aspects 1
of 1
this 1
whole 1
bizarre 1
situation 1
that 0
the 0
reasons 0
offered 0
have 0
been 0
so 1
trivial, 1
so 1
inappropriately, 1
so 1
disproportionately 1
petty. 1

These 0
absurd 1
responses 1
to 1
serious 1
questions 1
of 1
grave 1
import 1
have 0
raised 0
the 0
inescapable 0
suspicion 0
that 0
Benedict 0
simply 0
did 0
not 0
take 0
the 0
papacy 0
as 0
seriously 0
as 0
the 0
rest 0
of 0
us 0
did. 0

We 0
cannot 0
help 0
but 0
wonder 0
if 0
these 0
trivialised 0
responses 0
reveal 0
some 0
deep 0
flaw 0
that 0
we 0
had 0
never 0
suspected 0
before. 0

Could 1
we 1
have 1
been 1
wrong 1
about 1
him? 1

And 1
if 1
so, 1
could 1
we 1
have 1
been 1
this 1
wrong? 1

For 0
reasons, 0
all 0
we 0
heard 0
at 0
the 0
time 0
was, 0
essentially, 0
“I’m 1
tired.” 1
There 0
was 0
some 0
implication 0
that 0
he 0
didn’t 0
feel 0
up 0
to 0
international 0
travel 0
anymore, 0
so 0
couldn’t 0
make 0
it 0
to 0
World 0
Youth 0
Day 0
and 0
similar 0
events. 0

The 0
trivialising 0
of 0
the 0
resignation 0
seemed 0
to 0
go 0
hand 0
in 0
hand 0
with 0
the 0
modern 0
concept 0
of 0
the 0
pope-as-pop-star, 1
something 0
we 0
had 0
thought 0
Benedict 0
was 0
too 0
serious 0
a 0
man, 0
too 0
serious 0
a 0
Catholic, 0
to 0
believe 0
himself. 0

Of 0
all 0
people, 0
we 0
had 0
assumed 0
that 0
Benedict 0
XVI 0
took 0
the 0
papacy 0
seriously. 0

And 0
since 0
then, 0
as 0
all 0
the 0
poisons 0
that 0
had 0
been 0
lurking 0
for 0
fifty 0
years 0
in 0
the 0
NewChurch 1
mud 1
are 0
busily 0
hatching 0
out, 0
many 0
Catholics 0
want 0
to 0
know 0
why 0
we 0
hear 0
nothing 0
from 0
him? 0

This 0
man 0
whom 0
we 0
had 0
believed 0
a 0
“champion 1
of 1
orthodoxy,” 1
whom 0
we 0
thought 0
we 0
knew. 0

Error, 0
even 0
heresy 1
and 1
blasphemy 1
are 0
pouring 0
daily 0
out 0
of 0
the 0
mouth 0
of 0
his 0
successor, 0
who 0
has, 0
literally, 0
turned 1
the 1
Vatican 1
into 1
a 1
den 1
of 1
thieves, 1
and 0
we 0
hear 0
nothing 0
but 0
the 0
occasional, 0
carefully 0
worded 0
statement 0
on 0
how 0
fine 0
everything 0
is. 0

How 0
content 0
he 0
is 0
with 0
his 0
decision 0
and 0
how 0
happy 0
with 0
his 0
current 0
life. 0

After 0
three 0
years 0
of 0
systematic 0
dismantling 0
of 0
everything 0
he 0
had 0
attempted 0
to 0
do 0
in 0
his 0
pontificate, 0
we 0
got 0
this 0
from 0
an 0
apparently 0
utterly 1
insouciant 1
Ratzinger, 0
addressed 0
to 0
Francis: 0
“Your 0
goodness 0
is 0
my 0
home 0
and 0
the 0
place 0
where 0
I 0
feel 0
safe.” 0
Everyone 0
who 0
had 0
ever 0
read 0
anything 0
he 0
had 0
written 0
were 0
amazed 0
he 0
was 0
capable 0
of 0
producing 0
such 0
maudlin 0
drivel, 0
but 0
the 0
video 0
doesn’t 0
lie: 0

So 0
strange 0
was 0
this 0
new 0
tone 0
that 0
speculation 0
started 0
circulating 0
that 0
he 0
was 0
under 0
some 0
kind 0
of 0
external 0
compulsion, 0
not 0
free 0
to 0
speak 0
his 0
mind. 0

But 0
this 0
is 0
not 0
what 0
we 0
see. 0

There 0
he 0
is, 0
manifestly 0
happy 0
and 0
reading 0
it 0
out 0
loud. 0

“Perhaps 0
it 0
was 0
written 0
for 0
him.” 0
Well, 0
why 0
repeat 0
it 0
then? 0

Why, 0
if 0
he 0
has 0
any 0
qualms, 0
allow 0
himself 0
to 0
be 0
trotted 0
out 0
on 0
such 0
occasions, 0
to 0
read 0
this 0
blatant 0
propaganda? 0

If 0
it 0
is 0
a 0
deception, 0
why 0
participate 0
in 0
it? 0

In 0
fact, 0
all 0
the 0
hopeful 0
commenters 0
on 0
blogs 0
and 0
other 0
social 0
media 0
who 0
keep 0
telling 0
me 0
how 0
much 0
they 0
“miss” 0
him 0
have 0
failed 0
to 0
respect 0
him 0
in 0
one 0
way; 0
they 0
won’t 0
take 0
him 0
at 0
his 0
word. 0

Some 0
insist 0
that 0
his 0
resignation 0
was 0
under 0
some 0
sort 0
of 0
coercion 0
and 0
so 0
isn’t 0
valid. 0

But 0
we 0
have 0
repeatedly 0
heard 0
from 0
him 0
that 0
he 0
was 0
under 0
no 0
constraint, 0
that 0
he 0
had 0
resigned 0
freely. 0

And 0
indeed, 0
far 0
from 0
being 0
an 0
isolated 0
“prisoner 1
of 1
the 1
Vatican,” 1
Benedict 0
has 0
received 0
many 0
guests 0
all 0
of 0
whom 0
report 0
that, 0
though 0
frail, 0
he 0
appears 0
content 0
and 0
never 0
utters 0
a 0
word 0
of 0
criticism. 0

We 0
have 0
yet 0
to 0
hear 0
any 0
report 0
of 0
any 0
notes 0
begging 0
for 0
rescue 0
hidden 0
under 0
a 0
lunch 0
table 0
placemat. 0

There’s 0
no 0
doubt 0
that 0
this 0
is 0
an 0
extremely 0
strange 0
and 0
frankly 0
fishy 0
situation; 0
something 0
doesn’t 0
add 0
up, 0
it’s 0
true. 0

All 0
the 0
questions 0
have 0
gone 0
ignored, 0
or 0
have 0
received 0
frivolous, 1
jokey 1
responses: 1

Why 0
did 0
you 0
resign? 0

Ratzinger: 0
“I 0
was 0
a 0
bit 0
tired 0
and 0
didn’t 0
feel 0
up 0
to 0
partying 0
with 0
the 0
kids 0
at 0
World 0
Youth 0
Day.” 0

If 0
you’re 0
not 0
pope, 0
why 0
do 0
you 0
still 0
wear 0
the 0
white? 0

Ratzinger: 0
“Oh, 0
there 0
wasn’t 0
a 0
black 0
cassock 0
that 0
fit 0
me.” 0

Why 0
do 0
you 0
continue 0
to 0
call 0
yourself 0
Benedict 0
XVI 0
if 0
you 0
are 0
no 0
longer 0
pope? 0

Ratzinger: 0
“Well, 0
I’m 0
an 0
‘emeritus,’ 0
you 0
see…” 0

And 0
where 0
did 0
this 0
“emeritus” 0
business 0
come 0
from? 0

Does 0
it 0
have 0
any 0
precedent 0
in 0
Catholic 0
history? 0

What 0
does 0
it 0
mean 0
canonically 0
and 0
doctrinally? 0

Ratzinger: 0
“…” 0

What 0
was 0
all 1
that 1
rubbish 1
from 0
Ganswein 0
about 0
there 0
being 0
a 0
divided 0
“munus” 0
– 0
with 0
an 0
active 0
member 0
and 0
a 0
“contemplative 0
member”? 0

Doesn’t 0
that 0
just 0
mean 0
there 0
are 0
two 0
popes 0
now? 0

Ratzinger: 0
“…” 0

And 0
perhaps 0
most 0
agonising 0
of 0
all: 0
“How 1
can 1
you 1
just 1
sit 1
there 1
smiling, 1
issuing 1
bland 1
platitudinous 1
nonsense, 1
while 1
this 1
lunatic 1
drives 1
the 1
sheep 1
off 1
a 1
cliff?” 1

A 0
few 0
days 0
ago, 0
my 0
friend 0
Steve 0
Skojec, 0
of 0
the 0
traditionalist/restorationist 0
website 0
One 0
Peter 0
Five, 0
summed 0
up 0
the 0
consternation 0
of 0
those 0
of 0
us 0
who 0
still 0
feel 0
a 0
lingering 0
affection 0
for 0
(the 0
man 0
we 0
used 0
to 0
call) 0
Pope 0
Benedict. 0

Steve 0
summons 0
up 0
in 0
this 0
brief 0
post 0
all 0
the 0
anger 0
and 0
all 0
the 0
crushing 1
disappointment 1
most 0
of 0
us 0
probably 0
still 0
feel 0
reluctant 0
to 0
express 0
out 0
loud: 0

Five 0
years 0
ago 0
today, 0
Pope 0
Benedict 0
XVI 0
abdicated 0
the 0
papacy. 0

And 0
through 0
the 0
abandonment 0
of 0
his 0
duty 0
to 0
shepherd 0
the 0
Church, 0
he 0
made 0
way 0
for 0
the 0
worst 0
papacy 0
of 0
all 0
time 0
– 0
one 0
he 0
steadfastly 0
refuses 0
to 0
oppose 0
in 0
word, 0
deed, 0
or 0
even 0
the 0
subtlest 0
gesture. 0

You 0
may 0
love 0
him 0
for 0
various 0
reasons, 0
you 0
may 0
miss 0
him 0
by 0
contrast, 0
but 0
you 0
may 0
not 0
excuse 0
the 0
responsibility 0
he 0
has. 0

He 0
walked 0
away 0
from 0
his 0
family, 0
leaving 0
the 0
door 0
open 0
to 0
an 0
abusive 1
stepfather, 1
and 0
he 0
watches 1
his 1
children 1
beaten 1
and 1
led 1
astray 1
not 0
just 0
in 0
silence, 0
but 0
in 0
apparent 0
contentment. 0

And 0
still, 0
he 0
was 0
the 0
best 0
of 0
the 0
post-conciliar 0
popes, 0
which 0
is 0
why 0
he’s 0
the 0
only 0
one 0
who 0
won’t 0
be 0
canonized. 0

Who 0
is 0
the 0
real 0
Joseph 0
Ratzinger? 0

I 0
have 0
had 0
long-time 0
Vatican 0
watchers 0
say 0
to 0
me, 0
more 0
than 0
once, 0
“Maybe 0
it’s 0
really 0
just 0
that 0
he 0
wasn’t 0
who 0
we 0
thought 0
he 0
was.” 0
I 0
suspect 0
there 0
is 0
a 0
lot 0
more 0
to 0
this 0
than 0
most 0
people 0
might 0
imagine. 0

I 0
think 0
we 0
made 0
the 0
mistake 0
of 0
believing 0
the 0
press. 0

We 0
were 0
delighted 0
that 0
the 0
bitterly 1
anti-Catholic 1
media 1
hated 0
and 0
feared 0
him. 0

We 0
failed 0
to 0
recall 0
that 0
they 0
know 0
nothing 0
at 0
all 0
about 0
Catholicism. 0

What 0
the 0
papers 0
never 0
told 0
us 0
was 0
that 0
as 0
a 0
young 0
priest 0
and 0
theologian 0
Joseph 0
Ratzinger 0
was 1
known 1
as 1
a 1
“progressive,” 1
as 0
the 0
term 0
was 0
understood 0
in 0
1962. 0

This 0
reputation 0
was 0
cemented 0
during 0
his 0
work 0
as 0
the 0
peritus, 0
the 0
theological 0
advisor, 0
of 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
Council’s 0
most 0
influential 0
of 0
the 0
bishops 0
of 0
the 0
progressive 0
camp, 0
Cardinal 0
Josef 0
Frings 0
of 0
Cologne. 0

Frings’ 0
claim 0
to 0
fame 0
in 0
that 0
great 0
drama 0
was 0
a 0
speech 0
criticising 0
the 0
CDF 0
– 0
and 0
its 0
prefect 0
Cardinal 0
Alfredo 0
Ottaviani 0
– 0
for 0
the 0
“conservatism” 0
in 0
the 0
“schema,” 0
the 0
documents 0
prepared 0
by 0
the 0
CDF 0
for 0
guiding 0
the 0
bishops’ 0
discussions. 0

After 0
this 0
speech, 0
there 0
was 0
an 0
uprising 0
among 0
the 0
bishops 0
of 0
the 0
preparatory 0
committee 0
who 0
demanded 0
that 0
the 0
schema 0
– 0
that 0
had 0
taken 0
years 0
to 0
develop 0
– 0
be 0
abandoned. 0

This 0
was 0
done, 0
over 0
Ottaviani’s 0
futile 1
objections, 1
and 0
new 0
documents 0
were 0
rapidly 0
cobbled 0
together 0
by 0
a 0
coalition 0
of 0
German 0
and 0
French 0
“progressives” 1
who 0
rejoiced 0
that 0
they 0
had, 0
in 0
effect, 0
seized 0
control 0
of 0
the 0
Council 0
from 0
that 0
moment, 0
before 0
it 0
had 0
even 0
started. 0

It 0
has 0
since 0
been 0
revealed 0
that 0
it 0
was 0
Joseph 0
Ratzinger 0
– 0
the 0
maverick 0
“progressive” 1
academic 1
theologian 1
Frings 1
had 0
brought 0
to 0
Rome 0
as 0
his 0
secretary 0
– 0
who 0
wrote 0
that 0
speech. 0

Cardinal 0
Henri 0
de 0
Lubac, 0
writing 0
in 0
1985, 0
recalling 0
that 0
drama, 0
said: 0

“Joseph 0
Ratzinger, 0
an 0
expert 0
at 0
the 0
Council, 0
was 0
also 0
the 0
private 0
secretary 0
of 0
Card. 0

Frings, 0
Archbishop 0
of 0
Cologne. 0

Blind, 0
the 0
old 0
Cardinal 0
largely 0
utilized 0
his 0
secretary 0
to 0
write 0
his 0
interventions. 0

Now 0
then, 0
one 0
of 0
these 0
interventions 0
became 0
memorable: 0
it 0
was 0
a 0
radical 0
criticism 0
of 0
the 0
methods 0
of 0
the 0
Holy 0
Office. 0

Despite 0
a 0
reply 0
by 0
Card. 0

Ottaviani, 0
Frings 0
sustained 0
his 0
critique. 0

“It 0

is 0
not 0
an 0
exaggeration 0
to 0
say 0
that 0
on 0
that 0
day 0
the 0
old 0
Holy 0
Office, 0
as 0
it 0
presented 0
itself 0
then, 0
was 0
destroyed 0
by 0
Ratzinger 0
in 0
union 0
with 0
his 0
Archbishop. 0

“Card. 0

Seper, 0

a 1
man 1
full 1
of 1
goodness, 1
intiated 0
the 0
renovation. 0

Ratzinger, 0
who 0
did 0
not 0
change, 0
continues 0
it.” 0

Ratzinger’s 0
reputation 0
as 0
a 0
“progressive” 1
is 0
not 0
based 0
on 0
one 0
incident, 0
nor 0
was 0
it 0
restricted 0
to 0
his 0
early 0
work. 0

It 0
went 0
unnoticed 0
in 0
the 0
shouting 0
over 0
his 0
running 0
of 0
CDF, 0
that 0
he 0
had 0
written 0
in 0
1982, 0
a 0
call 0
for 0
the 0
Church 0
“never 0
to 0
return” 0
to 0
the 0
Syllabus 0
of 0
Errors 0
of 0
Pius 0
IX. 0

In 0
his 0
book 0
Principles 0
of 0
Catholic 0
Theology, 0
Ratzinger 0
proposed 0
the 0
question, 0
“Should 0
the 0
Council 0
be 0
revoked?” 0
and 0
in 0
response 0
recommended 0
the 0
“razing 0
of 0
the 0
bastions” 0
of 0
the 0
Catholic 0
Church 0
in 0
relation 0
to 0
the 0
modern 0
world: 0

The 0
duty 0
is, 0
therefore, 0
not 0
to 0
suppress 0
the 0
Council, 0
but 0
to 0
discover 0
the 0
real 0
Council 0
and 0
delve 0
deep 0
into 0
what 0
it 0
truly 0
wants 0
with 0
regard 0
to 0
what 0
has 0
happened 0
since 0
then. 0

This 0

implies 0
that 0
there 0
is 0
no 0
possible 0
return 0
to 0
the 0
Syllabus, 0
which 0
could 0
well 0
have 0
been 0
a 0
first 0
step 0
in 0
the 0
combat 0
against 0
Liberalism 0
and 0
the 0
nascent 0
Marxism, 0
but 0
which 0
cannot 0
be 0
the 0
last 0
word. 0

Neither 0
embraces 0
nor 0
the 0
ghetto 0
can 0
resolve 0
the 0
problem 0
of 0
[relations 0
with] 0
the 0
modern 0
world 0
for 0
the 0
Christian. 0

Hence, 0
the 0
'razing 0
of 0
the 0
bastions' 0
that 0
Hans 0
Urs 0
von 0
Balthasar 0
called 0
for 0
already 0
in 0
1952 0
was 0
in 0
effect 0
an 0
urgent 0
duty. 0

It 0
was 0
necessary 0
for 0
her 0
[the 0
Church] 0
to 0
raze 0
the 0
old 0
bastions 0
and 0
confide 0
only 0
in 0
the 0
protection 0
of 0
the 0
faith, 0
the 0
power 0
of 0
the 0
word 0
that 0
is 0
her 0
unique, 0
true, 0
and 0
permanent 0
strength. 0

But 0
to 0
raze 0
the 0
bastions 0
cannot 0
signify 0
that 0
she 0
no 0
longer 0
has 0
anything 0
to 0
protect, 0
or 0
that 0
she 0
can 0
live 0
owing 0
to 0
different 0
forces 0
than 0
those 0
that 0
engendered 0
her: 0
the 1
water 1
and 1
the 1
blood 1
that 1
poured 1
from 1
the 1
open 1
side 1
of 1
her 1
crucified 1
Lord. 1

His 0
was 0
the 0
thesis 0
– 0
a 0
mainstay 0
of 0
“conservative” 0
ideology 0
– 0
that 0
the 0
“real” 0
Council, 0
if 0
only 0
implemented 0
properly, 0
would 0
be 0
the 0
salvation 0
of 0
the 0
Church 0
and 0
the 0
world, 0
a 0
theme 0
he 0
never 0
left. 0

How 0
ironic 0
it 0
must 0
have 0
seemed 0
to 0
those 0
who 0
remembered 0
this 0
history 0
that 0
Ratzinger 0
would 0
himself 0
be 0
given 0
the 0
office 0
he 0
had 0
“destroyed” 0
and 0
would 0
gain 0
the 0
media-generated 0
reputation 0
as 0
an 0
“arch-conservative”. 1

And 0
it 0
starts 0
to 0
suggest 0
an 0
answer, 0
or 0
at 0
least 0
a 0
line 0
of 0
inquiry, 0
about 0
why 0
so 0
little 0
was 0
actually 0
accomplished 0
in 0
his 0
long 0
tenure. 0

With 0
the 0
“arch-conservative” 1
“Rottweiler” 1
Ratzinger 1
in 0
CDF, 0
why 0
do 0
we 0
have 0
the 0
situation 0
we 0
have 0
today? 0

What 0
did 0
he 0
do 0
to 0
stop 0
the 0
explosion 0
of 0
neo-modernism 0
– 0
that 0
burned 1
like 1
an 1
unchecked 1
wildfire 1
throughout 1
the 1
Catholic 1
world 1
through 0
the 0
reign 0
of 0
John 0
Paul 0
II? 0

What 0
did 0
“silencing” 0
by 0
Ratzinger’s 0
CDF 0
do 0
to 0
stop 0
Hans 0
Kung 0
becoming 0
a 0
celebrity 1
“priest-theologian,” 1
courted 0
by 0
the 0
media 0
for 0
his 0
loathing 0
of 0
Catholicism? 0

Kung, 0
who 0
was 0
never 0
removed 0
from 0
the 0
priesthood 0
despite 0
his 0
manifest 0
heresy? 0

Can 0
we 0
think 0
of 0
any 0
other 0
names 0
who 0
were 0
corrected 0
even 0
to 0
this 0
degree? 0

Precious 0
few. 0

But 0
we 0
can 0
certainly 0
think 0
of 0
many, 0
many 0
who 0
spent 0
their 0
lives 0
and 0
vocations 0
blatantly 1
denying 1
and 1
undermining 1
the 0
Catholic 0
Faith 0
– 0
academic 0
theologians, 0
religious, 0
priests, 0
bishops 0
and 0
cardinals 0
around 0
the 0
world 0
– 0
with 0
never 0
a 0
peep 0
of 0
protest 0
from 0
Rome. 0

Moreover, 0
the 0
scandalous 0
pack 0
of 0
frauds 0
we 0
currently 0
have 0
in 0
the 0
episcopate 0
is 0
entirely 0
the 0
product 0
of 0
the 0
“arch-conservative” 1
John 0
Paul 0
II 0
and 0
the 0
“Rottweiler” 1
Benedict 1
XVI 1
pontificates. 0

Why 0
did 0
we 0
think 0
that 0
Ratzinger, 0
in 0
this 0
crucial 0
role 0
of 0
CDF 0
prefect, 0
was 0
a 0
bulwark 0
of 0
orthodoxy? 0

Is 0
it 0
simply 0
that 0
we 0
have 0
moved 0
so 0
far 0
away 0
from 0
the 0
ancient 0
Faith 0
that 0
we 0
no 0
longer 0
have 0
a 0
realistic 0
notion 0
of 0
the 0
Faith 0
ourselves 0
to 0
make 0
a 0
comparison, 0
to 0
make 0
an 0
objective 0
judgement? 0

The 0
“progressive” 1
destroyer 1
of 1
Ottaviani 1
inheriting 0
his 0
office 0
and 0
the 0
epithet 0
“arch-conservative”… 1

Indeed, 0
Ratzinger 0
himself 0
maintained 0
that 0
he 0
had 0
never 0
changed 0
his 0
theological 0
opinions. 0

He 0
was 0
to 0
say 0
that 0
it 0
was 0
his 0
old 0
academic 0
colleagues 0
like 0
Kung 0
and 0
Kasper 0
who 0
had 0
moved 0
further 0
to 0
the 0
ideological 0
“left” 0
after 0
the 0
1960s 0
while 0
he 0
stayed 0
in 0
place. 0

Perhaps 0
now, 0
as 0
an 0
answer 0
that 0
fits 0
our 0
apparently 0
contradictory 0
puzzle 0
pieces, 0
we 0
can 0
finally 0
accept 0
his 0
word 0
on 0
this. 0

Perhaps 0
the 0
world 0
of 0
Catholic 0
academic 0
theology 0
had 0
become 0
so 0
corrupted 0
that 0
a 1
man 1
called 1
“progressive” 1
in 0
1963, 0
but 0
whose 0
ideas 0
remained 0
the 0
same, 0
would 0
look 0
like 0
a 0
“champion 0
of 0
traditional 0
Catholic 0
orthodoxy” 0
by 0
2005. 0

Is 0
this 0
why 0
he 0
resigned? 0

Is 0
it 0
simply 0
that 0
his 0
conception 0
of 0
the 0
Church, 0
of 0
the 0
papacy, 0
was 0
never 0
what 0
Catholics 0
believed 0
about 0
it? 0

Perhaps 0
a 0
hint 0
at 0
the 0
answer 0
comes 0
from 0
La 0
Stampa 0
in 0
2015 0
which 0
published 0
some 0
of 0
the 0
memoirs 0
of 0
Silvano 0
Fausti, 0
SJ, 0
who 0
had 0
been 0
confessor 0
and 0
spiritual 0
guide 0
of 0
Cardinal 0
Carlo 0
Maria 0
Martini, 0
the 0
godfather 1
of 1
the 1
“liberal” 1
European 1
Catholic 1
Church, 1
and 0
alleged 0
leader 0
of 0
the 0
“Sankt 0
Gallen 0
Mafia” 0
that 0
Cardinal 0
Danneels 0
admitted 0
conspired 0
for 0
years 0
against 0
Pope 0
Benedict. 0

Fausti 0
said 0
that 0
Benedict 0
met 0
with 0
Martini 0
at 0
the 0
bishops’ 0
palace 0
of 0
Milan 0
in 0
June 0
2012. 0

Martini, 0
Fausti 0
said, 0
urged 0
Benedict 0
to 0
resign 0
the 0
papacy. 0

Apparently 0
at 0
the 0
time 0
of 0
his 0
election 0
in 0
2005, 0
Martini 0
had 0
said 0
it 0
would 0
be 0
his 0
main 0
task 0
to 0
reform 0
the 0
Curia. 0

By 0
2012, 0
this 0
had 0
proved 0
impossible. 0

Why 0
would 0
Benedict 0
take 0
advice 0
from 0
a 0
man 0
like 0
Martini 0
– 0
the 1
“godfather” 1
of 1
the 1
“liberal 1
wing” 1
of 1
European 1
Catholicism? 1

I 0
think 0
the 0
question 0
would 0
not 0
even 0
occur 0
to 0
a 0
man 0
like 0
Ratzinger. 0

They 0
were 0
esteemed 0
academic 0
colleagues. 0

They 0
were 0
brothers 0
of 0
the 0
episcopate. 0

They 0
were 0
members 0
of 0
the 0
club. 0

Any 0
appearance 0
of 0
ideological 0
division 0
between 0
them 0
was, 0
in 0
essence, 0
a 0
product 0
of 0
the 0
media 0
narrative. 0

Why 0
wouldn’t 0
the 0
pope 0
take 0
the 0
advice 0
of 0
his 0
most 0
respected 0
and 0
senior 0
cardinal? 0

Why 0
is 0
Walter 0
Kasper 0
a 0
cardinal? 0

One 0
of 0
the 0
most 0
prominent 0
of 0
those 0
puzzle 0
pieces 0
is 0
the 0
apparent 0
inability 0
of 0
these 0
“conservative” 0
prelates, 0
to 0
detect, 0
let 0
alone 0
effectively 0
oppose, 0
these 0
brazen 1
enemies 1
of 1
the 1
Faith 1
within 0
the 0
episcopate 0
and 0
College 0
of 0
Cardinals. 0

It 0
beggars 0
belief 0
of 0
ordinary 0
people 0
that, 0
after 0
so 0
many 0
years 0
of 0
hearing 0
and 0
reading 0
them, 0
Ratzinger 0
would 0
remain 0
on 0
such 0
friendly 0
terms 0
with 0
men 0
like 0
Walter 0
Kasper 0
and 0
Carlo 0
Maria 0
Martini, 0
the 0
alleged 1
brains 1
of 1
the 1
Sankt 1
Gallen 1
Mafia. 1

When, 0
at 0
his 0
very 0
first 0
Angelus 0
address 0
in 0
2013, 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
told 0
the 0
crowd 0
how 0
much 0
he 0
loved 0
the 0
writing 0
of 0
Walter 0
Kasper, 0
quite 0
a 0
lot 0
of 0
us 0
who 0
had 0
spent 0
many 0
years 0
watching 0
the 0
Vatican 0
started 0
understanding 0
where 0
we 0
were 0
all 0
headed 0
with 0
the 0
new 0
pope. 0

Jorge 0
Bergoglio 0
might 0
have 0
been 0
unknown 0
to 0
the 0
larger 0
Catholic 0
world, 0
but 0
Walter 0
Kasper 0
was 0
a 0
celebrity 1
heretic, 1
the 0
media-savvy 1
frontman 1
for 1
the 1
“ultra-liberal” 1
“wing” 1
of 0
the 0
post-Vatican 0
II 0
Church. 0

In 0
an 0
article 0
on 0
the 0
cardinal’s 0
life’s 0
work, 0
Thomas 0
Jansen, 0
the 0
editor-in-chief 0
of 0
Katholisch.de, 0
recently 0
noted 0
that 0
Walter 0
Kasper 0
could 0
not 0
possibly 0
have 0
done 0
the 0
damage 0
he 0
has 0
without 0
the 0
direct 0
assistance 0
of 0
both 0
John 0
Paul 0
II 0
and 0
Pope 0
Benedict. 0

The 0
monstrous 0
debacle 0
of 0
Amoris 0
Laetitia 0
is 0
as 0
much 0
Kasper’s 0
work 0
as 0
Bergoglio’s. 0

This 0
is 0
a 0
man 0
who 0
has, 0
for 0
40 0
years, 0
never 0
troubled 0
to 0
hide 0
his 0
heterodox 0
opinions 0
and 0
has 0
devoted 0
much 0
of 0
his 0
life 0
to 0
a 0
campaign 0
to 0
bring 0
about 0
precisely 0
this 0
outcome. 0

Jansen 0
points 0
out 0
that 0
Kasper 0
had 0
already 0
tried 0
to 0
bring 0
out 0
the 0
same 0
proposal 0
for 0
Communion 0
for 0
divorced 0
and 0
remarried 0
in 0
1993, 0
together 0
with 0
Karl 0
Lehmann, 0
another 1
“Sankt 1
Gallen” 1
member. 1

This 0
was 0
stopped 0
by 0
Ratzinger 0
and 0
the 0
CDF. 0

But 0
that 0
raises 0
the 0
next 0
question; 0
if 0
Ratzinger 0
knew 0
so 0
well 0
what 1
kind 1
of 1
creature 1
Kasper 1
was, 1
why 0
wasn’t 0
the 0
next 0
step 0
to 0
pitch 0
him 0
out 0
of 0
the 0
episcopate 0
on 0
his 0
ear? 0

Why 0
was 0
he 0
not 0
– 0
at 0
the 0
very 0
least 0
– 0
given 0
the 0
same 0
“silencing” 0
treatment 0
as 0
Kung? 0

Kasper 0
has 0
recently 0
gone 0
to 0
the 0
media 0
again 0
to 0
complain 0
of 0
being 0
called 0
a 0
heretic. 0

But 0
it’s 0
a 0
simple 0
truth: 0
he’s 1
a 1
heretic. 1

Everyone 0
knows 0
he’s 0
a 0
heretic 0
because 0
we 0
have 0
heard 0
him 0
trumpeting 1
in 1
his 1
blatant 1
heresies 1
from 1
every 1
rooftop 1
he 1
could 1
find 1
for 0
decades. 0

After 0
openly 0
working 0
against 0
the 0
Faith, 0
instead 0
of 0
being 0
demoted, 0
silenced, 0
laicised 0
and/or 0
excommunicated, 0
John 0
Paul 0
II 0
made 0
him 0
a 0
cardinal. 0

Remember 0
that 0
his 0
scheme 0
to 0
Amoris-Latitia-ize 0
the 0
Church 0
was 0
stopped 0
by 0
Ratzinger’s 0
CDF 0
in 0
1993. 0

But 0
he 0
was 0
not 0
demoted, 0
reprimanded 0
or 0
corrected 0
in 0
any 0
way. 0

Nor 0
was 0
he 0
removed 0
from 0
places 0
of 0
influence. 0

Far 0
from 0
it. 0

In 0
1994 0
Kasper 0
was 0
inserted 0
into 0
the 0
Vatican 0
Curia 0
by 0
being 0
named 0
co-chair 0
of 0
the 0
International 0
Commission 0
for 0
Lutheran-Catholic 0
Dialogue. 0

In 0
1999, 0
he 0
made 0
another 0
step 0
up, 0
being 0
appointed 0
secretary 0
of 0
the 0
Pontifical 0
Council 0
for 0
Promoting 0
Christian 0
Unity, 0
the 0
“ecumenical” 0
office 0
where 0
his 0
manifest 0
religious 0
indifferentism 0
could 0
be 0
given 0
free 0
reign. 0

In 0
2001, 0
he 0
was 0
made 0
a 0
Cardinal-deacon 0
with 0
the 0
awesome 1
responsibility 1
of 0
voting 0
in 0
a 0
Conclave. 0

Then 0
Benedict 0
allowed 0
him 0
to 0
remain 0
a 0
cardinal. 0

And, 0
as 0
if 0
to 0
add 0
a 0
finishing 1
touch 1
to 1
the 1
poisoned 1
cake 1
that 0
is 0
Ratzinger’s 0
involvement 0
in 0
the 0
creation 0
of 0
the 0
New 0
Catholic 0
Paradigm, 0
Benedict 0
is 0
now 0
being 0
said 0
to 0
have 0
deliberately 0
timed 0
his 0
resignation 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
allow 0
his 0
old 0
academic 0
colleague 0
to 0
participate 0
in 0
the 0
2013 0
Conclave. 0

As 0
Jansen 0
pointed 0
out, 0
and 0
Maike 0
Hickson 0
quoted 0
in 0
a 0
piece 0
for 0
One 0
Peter 0
Five, 0

Cardinal 0
Kasper 0
barely 0
even 0
made 0
it 0
into 0
the 0
last 0
conclave, 0
because 0
he 0
had 0
just 0
turned 0
80 0
years 0
of 0
age. 0

But 0
since 0
the 0
date 0
of 0
the 0
death 0
(or 0
abdication, 0
as 0
it 0
was 0
the 0
case 0
in 0
2013) 0
of 0
the 0
pope 0
is 0
decisive, 0
he 0
was 0
still 0
able 0
to 0
attend 0
and 0
vote 0
in 0
that 0
election. 0

(As 0
some 0
observers 0
noted, 0
it 0
was 0
a 0
generous 0
gesture 0
toward 0
Cardinal 0
Kasper 0
that 0
Pope 0
Benedict 0
XVI 0
had 0
decided 0
to 0
retire 0
in 0
due 0
time.) 0

Excuse 0
me 0
Maike, 0
but 0
I 0
don’t 0
think 0
this 0
is 0
a 0
parenthetical 0
issue. 0

Is 1
it 1
any 1
wonder 1
that 1
so 1
many 1
Catholics 1
have 1
become 1
disaffected? 1

Cardinal 0
Ratzinger, 0
Pope 0
“Emeritus” 0
Benedict 0
– 0
whatever 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
call 1
yourself 1
– 0
I 0
have 0
one 0
question 0
that 0
I 0
would 0
really 0
like 0
you 0
to 0
answer: 0
Why 1
is 1
this 1
man 1
still 1
a 1
cardinal? 1

Why 1
is 1
he 1
still 1
a 1
bishop? 1

Why 1
is 1
he 1
still 1
allowed 1
to 1
call 1
himself 1
a 1
“Catholic 1
theologian”? 1

Why 1
did 1
you, 1
apparently 1
deliberately, 1
ensure 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
able 1
to 1
enter 1
the 1
Conclave 1
to 1
decide 1
who 1
your 1
successor 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
be? 1

Doesn’t 0
anyone 0
else 0
want 0
to 0
know 0
this? 0

Don’t 0
we 0
all 0
want 0
to 0
know 0
why 0
Hans 0
Kung 0
is 0
still 0
a 0
priest? 0

Why 0
was 0
Cardinal 0
Mahony 0
allowed 0
to 0
retire 0
in 0
good 0
standing? 0

Why 0
a 0
man 0
like 0
Weakland, 0
the 0
active 1
homosexual 1
who 0
paid 0
off 0
his 0
ex-lover, 0
was 0
not 0
excommunicated? 0

What 0
are 0
the 0
names 0
we 0
all 0
remember, 0
just 0
off 0
the 0
top 0
of 0
our 0
heads? 0

My 0
own 0
bishop 0
in 0
Victoria, 0
the 0
occultist 0
Remi 0
de 0
Roo, 0
Seattle’s 0
Raymond 0
Hunthausen, 0
Miami’s 0
Favalora, 0
Rochester’s 0
Matthew 0
Clark, 0
Derek 0
Worlock 0
of 0
Liverpool… 0
I 0
sometimes 0
wonder 0
how 0
long 0
that 0
list 0
is 0
going 0
to 0
be 0
when 0
this 0
is 0
all 0
over. 0

For 0
fifty 0
years 0
Catholics 0
have 0
wanted 0
to 0
know 0
why 0
nothing 0
was 0
ever 0
done, 0
as 0
these 0
wolves 1
in 1
the 1
episcopate 1
were 0
allowed, 0
year 0
after 0
year 0
to 0
continue 0
attacking 0
the 0
Church. 0

Why 1
have 1
we 1
so 1
often 1
seen 1
these 1
men 1
– 1
compromised 1
intellectually 1
and 1
morally 1
– 1
elevated 1
to 1
superior 1
rank, 1
despite 1
the 1
incredible 1
brazenness 1
of 1
their 1
hatred 1
of 1
the 1
Catholic 1
Faith? 1

The 0
end 0
of 0
“Big 0
Umbrella 0
Catholicism” 0

The 0
New 0
York 0
Times’ 0
Ross 0
Douthat 0
is 0
among 0
those 0
who 0
are 0
starting 0
to 0
ask 0
these 0
kinds 0
of 0
questions. 0

Maike 0
Hickson 0
quotes 0
him, 0
writing 0
of 0
this 0
bizarre 0
situation 0
– 0
in 0
which 0
each, 0
of 0
the 0
so-called 0
“Sankt 1
Gallen 1
Mafia” 1
prelates, 1
including 0
Kasper, 0
who 0
openly 0
campaigned 0
for 0
the 0
effective 0
abolition 0
of 0
Catholic 0
moral 0
teaching: 0
“It 0
was 0
characteristic 0
of 0
the 0
church’s 0
effective 0
truce 0
[between 0
conservatives 0
and 0
progressivists] 0
that 0
John 0
Paul 0
II 0
himself 0
had 0
given 0
most 0
of 0
them 0
their 0
red 0
hats, 0
elevating 0
them 0
despite 0
their 0
disagreement 0
with 0
his 0
restorationist 0
approach.” 0

When 0
journalists 0
talk 0
about 0
Catholicism, 0
they 0
often 0
speak 0
of 0
a 0
man 0
like 0
Kasper 0
being 0
– 0
as 0
his 0
Wikipedia 0
page 0
puts 0
it 0
– 0
“one 1
of 1
the 1
main 1
figures 1
of 1
the 1
liberal 1
wing 1
of 1
the 1
Catholic 1
Church.” 1
And 0
this 0
is 0
supposed 0
to 0
make 0
some 0
kind 0
of 0
sense 0
to 0
Catholics, 0
we’re 0
supposed 0
to 0
accept 0
it 0
as 0
the 0
reality 0
of 0
our 0
times. 0

There’s 0
a 0
“liberal 0
wing” 0
and 0
a 0
“conservative 0
wing” 0
and 0
they’re 0
both 0
Catholic. 0

Steve 0
Skojec 0
told 0
me 0
that 0
our 0
willingness 0
to 0
go 0
along 0
with 0
the 0
whole 0
“emeritus 1
pope” 1
charade 1
was 0
an 0
error: 0
“I 0
think 0
the 0
problem 0
is 0
that 0
we 0
all 0
went 0
along 0
with 0
their 0
game 0
of 0
make 0
believe, 0
and 0
we 0
shouldn’t 0
have.” 0
In 0
fact, 0
I 0
am 0
starting 0
to 0
think 0
that 0
the 0
willingness 0
of 0
most 0
Catholics 0
to 0
go 0
along 0
with 0
the 0
entire 0
charade 1
of 1
post-conciliar 1
Catholicism 1
has 0
been 0
a 0
grave 0
error. 0

By 0
playing 0
along, 0
by 0
pretending 0
that 0
we 0
could 0
be 0
“conservative 0
Catholics” 0
in 0
this 0
New 0
Paradigm 0
that 0
also 0
includes 0
“liberal 0
Catholics” 0
we 0
have 0
helped 0
them 0
perpetrate 0
one 0
the 0
most 0
monstrous 0
frauds 0
in 0
human 0
history. 0

Because 0
of 0
this 0
schizophrenic 1
mindset 1
of 1
the 1
Church’s 1
leadership 1
since 0
1965, 0
we 0
have 0
all 0
come 0
to 0
accept 0
the 0
underlying 0
premise; 0
that 0
the 0
Church 0
is 0
a 0
“big 0
umbrella” 0
with 0
plenty 0
of 0
room 0
for 0
people 0
of 0
all 0
personal 0
opinions, 0
that 0
such 0
issues 0
as 0
liturgy 0
are 0
matters 0
of 0
personal 0
“taste” 0
…that 0
two 0
opposed 0
things 0
can 0
both 0
be 0
Catholic 0
truth. 0

This 0
schizophrenia 1
is 0
the 0
model 0
under 0
which 0
“conservatives” 0
have 0
operated 0
all 0
this 0
time, 0
and 0
by 0
which 0
they 0
have 0
judged 0
a 0
man 0
like 0
Joseph 0
Ratzinger 0
to 0
be 0
a 0
“conservative 1
champion 1
of 1
orthodoxy.” 1
And 0
what 0
has 0
this 0
achieved? 0

It 0
created 0
cover 0
for 0
the 0
men 0
of 0
Kasper’s 0
clique 0
to 0
maneuver 0
their 0
man 0
on 0
the 0
throne 0
of 0
Peter 0
five 0
years 0
ago. 0

And 0
just 0
like 0
that, 0
the 0
jargon 0
of 0
“tolerance” 0
and 0
the 0
“big 0
umbrella” 0
is 0
over 0
and 0
the 0
purge 0
of 0
faithful, 0
believing 0
Catholic 0
religious, 0
seminarians, 0
priests, 0
and 0
academics 0
has 0
begun. 0

As 0
it 0
had 0
to. 0

They, 0
at 0
least, 0
do 0
not 0
harbour 0
this 0
insane 0
contradiction, 0
and 0
understand 0
– 0
and 0
frequently 0
say 0
out 0
loud 0
– 0
that 0
the 0
New 0
Paradigm 0
and 0
the 0
Catholic 0
Church 0
are 0
not 0
the 0
same. 0

And 0
their 0
New 0
Church 0
is 0
the 0
only 0
one 0
left. 0

For 0
five 0
decades 0
we 1
played 1
the 1
Anglican 1
game; 1
as 0
long 0
as 0
we 0
don’t 0
talk 0
about 0
it, 0
there 0
isn’t 0
a 0
problem. 0

Ottaviani’s 0
Holy 0
Office 0
and 0
schema 0
were 0
the 1
last 1
gasp 1
of 1
the 1
old 1
Church 1
– 0
and 0
as 0
de 0
Lubac 0
said 0
above, 0
it 0
was 0
killed 0
by 0
Joseph 0
Ratzinger. 0

We 0
had 0
a 0
long 0
hiatus 0
in 0
which 0
the 0
popes 0
pretended 0
nothing 0
essential 0
had 0
changed, 0
while 0
the 0
institution 0
around 0
them 0
fell 0
to 0
the 0
New 0
Paradigm, 0
until 0
the 0
papacy 0
was 0
the 0
only 0
thing 0
left. 0

One 0
of 0
the 0
things 0
I’ve 0
been 0
saying 0
is 0
a 0
blessing 0
in 0
disguise, 0
and 0
an 0
enormous 0
relief, 0
about 0
the 0
Bergoglian 0
era 0
is 0
that 0
we 0
can 0
finally 0
leave 0
behind 0
us 0
the 0
absurd 0
situation 0
of 0
the 0
Wojtyla/Ratzinger 0
era. 0

We 0
were 0
expected 0
for 0
all 0
those 0
years 0
to 0
pretend 0
we 0
were 0
in 0
the 0
“New 0
Springtime 0
of 0
Vatican 0
II,” 0
while 0
we 0
watched 0
these 0
wolves 1
in 1
shepherds’ 1
clothing 1
eating 1
the 1
sheep. 1

Now 0
we 0
can, 0
at 0
least, 0
finally 0
stop 0
pretending 0
that 0
everything 0
is 0
just 0
dandy 0
under 0
the 0
New 1
Paradigm 1
of 1
Merciful 1
Conciliar 1
Wonderfulness. 1

For 0
those 0
still 0
wondering, 0
Bergoglio 0
isn’t 0
a 0
shock, 0
he 0
isn’t 0
even 0
a 0
surprise; 0
he’s 0
just 0
the 0
logical 0
end 0
result. 0

This 0
pontificate 0
isn’t 0
an 0
anomaly; 0
it 0
was 0
the 0
only 0
possible 0
outcome, 0
and 0
it 0
was 0
as 0
much 0
the 0
work 0
of 0
Joseph 0
Ratzinger 0
as 0
Walter 0
Kasper. 0
