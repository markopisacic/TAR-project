what 0 439 1
many 0 439 1

people 0 439 2
that 0 439 2

Other 0 439 3

they 0 439 3

that 0 439 4

they 0 439 4
are 0 439 4
even 0 439 4
going 0 439 4
so 0 439 4
far 0 439 4
as 0 439 4
to 0 439 4
file 0 439 4
an 0 439 4

One 0 439 5
would 0 439 5
think 0 439 5
these 0 439 5

would 0 439 5

If 0 439 6

were, 0 439 6
they 0 439 6
wouldn't 0 439 6

it 0 439 7

I 0 439 32
suppose 0 439 32

As 0 439 39
they 0 439 39

It's 0 439 40
frivolous, 1 439 40

After 0 439 45
Mr. 0 439 45
Acosta 0 439 45
asked 0 439 45
the 0 439 45
President 0 439 45
two 0 439 45
questions 0 439 45
— 0 439 45

of 0 439 45
which 0 439 45
the 0 439 45
President 0 439 45
answered 0 439 45
— 0 439 45

that 0 439 45

This 0 439 46
was 0 439 46

Of 0 439 47

CNN 0 439 47
was 0 439 47
thrilled 0 439 47
as 0 439 47
Fox 0 439 47
more 0 439 47

Here's 0 439 52
the 0 439 52
thing, 0 439 52
if 0 439 52

and 0 439 56
Fox 0 439 56

people. 0 439 56
