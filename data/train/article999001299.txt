Fox 0
News 0
is 0
largely 0
controlled 0
opposition 0
despite 0
what 0
many 0
may 0
think. 0

They 0
have 0
a 0
couple 0
of 0
people 0
that 0
actually 0
are 0
conservative. 0

Other 0
than 0
that, 0
they 0
have 0
liberals 0
and 0
neo-cons 0
running 0
rampant. 1

Many 0
were 0
surprised 0
to 0
discover 0
that 0
Fox 0
News 0
not 0
only 0
is 0
supporting 0
lying 1
CNN 0
and 0
lying 1
Jim 0
Acosta, 0
but 0
they 0
are 0
even 0
going 0
so 0
far 0
as 0
to 0
file 0
an 0
amicus 0
brief 0
with 0
the 0
US 0
district 0
court 0
over 0
the 0
White 0
House's 0
revoking 0
of 0
Acosta's 0
press 0
pass. 0

One 0
would 0
think 0
these 0
people 0
would 0
understand 0
that 0
this 0
is 0
not 0
a 0
First 0
Amendment 0
issue. 0

If 0
it 0
were, 0
they 0
wouldn't 0
have 0
to 0
apply 0
for 0
a 0
White 0
House 0
press 0
pass. 0

This 0
is 0
a 0
privilege 0
issue 0
and 0
it 0
seems 0
that 0
Acosta 0
wore 0
out 0
his 0
welcome 0
with 0
his 0
attacks 0
on 0
Sarah 0
Sanders, 0
being 0

who 0
simply 0
tried 0
to 0
remove 0
the 0

him. 0

Trump 0

In 0
a 0
statement 0
by 0
Fox 0
News 0
President 0
Jay 0
Wallace, 0
he 0
wrote: 0

“Fox 0
News 0
supports 0
CNN 0
in 0
its 0
legal 0
effort 0
to 0
regain 0
its 0
White 0
House 0
reporter’s 0
press 0
credential. 0

We 0
intend 0
to 0
file 0
an 0
amicus 0
brief 0
with 0
the 0
U.S. 0
District 0
Court. 0

Secret 0
Service 0
passes 0
for 0
working 0
White 0
House 0
journalists 0
should 0
never 0
be 0
weaponized. 0

While 0
we 0
don’t 0
condone 0
the 0
growing 0
antagonistic 1
tone 0
by 0
both 0
the 0
president 0
and 0
the 0
press 0
at 0
recent 0

we 0
do 0
support 0
a 0
free 0
press, 0
access 0

open 0

for 0
the 0
American 1

So, 0
file 0
it! 0

On 1
the 1
basis 1
of 1
what, 1
Mr. 0
Wallace? 0

The 0
free 0
press 0
still 0
exists, 0
and 0
you 0
know 0
what? 0

Jim 0
Acosta 0
and 0
CNN 0
continue 0
to 0
lie, 1
just 0
like 0
they 0
have 0
for 0
decades, 0
and 0
here's 0
the 0
proof. 0

Look 0
how 0
they 0
doctored 0
the 0
video 0
to 0
not 0
show 0
what 0
clearly 0
took 0
place 0
and 0
then 0
lied 1
about 0
it, 0
and 0
I 0
suppose 0
Fox 0
falls 0
right 0
in 0
line 0
with 0
that 0
behavior. 0

So, 0
Fox 0
joins 0
with 0
the 1
least 1
trusted 1
name 1
in 1
news, 1
the 1
Clown 1
News 1
Network, 1
to 0
go 0
after 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
on 0
something 0
that 0
is 0
the 0
White 0
House's 0
prerogative 0
and 0
claim 0
it's 0
about 0
free 0
press. 0

It's 0
not. 0

Fox 0
reported: 0

The 0
White 0
House 0
Correspondents’ 0
Association 0
– 0
of 0
which 0
Fox 0
News 0
is 0
a 0
member 0
– 0
issued 0
a 0
statement 0
in 0
support 0
of 0
CNN’s 0
decision 0
to 0
take 0
legal 0
action. 0

“We 0
continue 0
to 0
urge 0
the 0
administration 0
to 0
reverse 0
course 0
and 0
fully 0
reinstate 0
CNN’s 0
correspondent,” 0
WHCA 0
President 0
Olivier 0
Knox 0
said. 0

“The 0
President 0
of 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
should 0
not 0
be 0
in 0
the 0
business 0
of 0
arbitrarily 0
picking 0
the 0
men 0
and 0
women 0
who 0
cover 0
him.” 0
However, 0
several 0
prominent 0
media 0
members 0
– 0
such 0
as 0
Pulitzer 1
Prize-winning 1
Watergate 1
journalist 1
Bob 1
Woodward 1
– 1
have 1
criticized 1
CNN 1
over 1
the 1
lawsuit. 1

As 0
they 0
should. 0

It's 0
frivolous, 1
but 0
because 0
they 0
are 0
immature 1
children 1
over 0
at 0
CNN, 0
it's 0
not 0
surprising, 0
and 0
frankly, 0
it's 0
no 0
surprise 0
coming 0
from 0
Fox 0
either. 0

White 0
House 0
Press 0
Secretary 0
Sarah 0
Sanders 0
called 0
the 0
CNN 0
lawsuit 0
"grandstanding." 0

I 0
wonder 0
what 0
she 0
will 0
call 0
the 0
amicus 0
brief 0
from 0
Fox. 0

"This 0
is 0
just 0
more 0
grandstanding 0
from 0
CNN, 0
and 0
we 0
will 0
vigorously 0
defend 0
against 0
this 0
lawsuit,” 0
Sanders 0
said. 0

“CNN, 0
who 0
has 0
nearly 0
50 0
additional 0
hard 0
pass 0
holders, 0
and 0
Mr. 0
Acosta 0
is 0
no 0
more 0
or 0
less 0
special 0
than 0
any 0
other 0
media 0
outlet 0
or 0
reporter 0
with 0
respect 0
to 0
the 0
First 0
Amendment. 0

After 0
Mr. 0
Acosta 0
asked 0
the 0
President 0
two 0
questions 0
— 0
each 0
of 0
which 0
the 0
President 0
answered 0
— 0
he 0
physically 0
refused 0
to 0
surrender 0
a 0
White 0
House 0
microphone 0
to 0
an 0
intern, 0
so 0
that 0
other 0
reporters 0
might 0
ask 0
their 0
questions. 0

This 0
was 0
not 0
the 0
first 0
time 0
this 0
reporter 0
has 0
inappropriately 0
refused 0
to 0
yield 0
to 0
other 0
reporters.” 0

Of 0
course, 0
CNN 0
was 0
thrilled 0
as 0
Fox 0
more 0
than 0
likely 0
helped 0
them 0
grow 0
a 0
little 0
in 0
ratings 0
by 0
issuing 0
support. 0

The 0
propaganda 0
outlet 0
tweeted 0
out 0
Fox's 0
statement. 0

Fox 0
News 0
will 0
file 0
an 0
amicus 0
brief 0
in 0
support 0
of 0
@Acosta 0
and 0
CNN. 0

Thank 0

Here's 0
the 0
thing, 0
if 0
it 0
is 0
a 0
right 0
to 0
have 0
a 0

See? 0

It 0
isn't 0
a 0

just 0
pulled 0

Do 0
you 0
