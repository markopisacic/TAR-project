But 0
Haig 0
is 0
an 0
engineer, 0
and 0
he 0
says 0
he's 0
not 0
a 0
former 0

officer. 0

It 0
should 0
be 0
noted 0
that 0
Haig's 0
rounds 0
were 0
probably 0
not 0
even 0
used 0
in 0
the 0
massacre: 0
Haig 0
sold 0
Paddock 0
tracer 0
ammunition, 0
which 0
emit 0
a 0

when 0

fired 0
these 0

during 0
the 0
nighttime 0
massacre 0
at 0
the 0
concert, 0
they 0
would 0
have 0
been 0
visible. 0

Haig's 0
attorney 0
Marc 0
Victor 0
told 0
reporters 0
it 0
was 0
perfectly 0
legal 0
for 0
Haig, 0
a 0
private 0
citizen, 0
to 0
sell 0
Paddock 0
hundreds 0
of 0
rounds 0
of 0
tracer 0
ammunition 0
— 0
the 0
bullets 0
are 0
legal 0
in 0
Arizona. 0

Paddock 0
showed 0
up 0
to 0
buy 0
ammunition 0
at 0
Haig's 0
home 0
after 0
meeting 0
him 0
at 0
a 0
gun 0
show 0
in 0
Phoenix. 0

"I 0
sold 0
him 0
600 0
rounds 0
of 0
.308 0
tracer, 0
surplus 0
U.S. 0
military. 0

I 0
sold 0
him 0
120 0
rounds 0
of 0
.556 0
tracer, 0
again, 0
surplus 0
U.S. 0

Haig 0
said 0
to 0
ABC15. 0

"I 0
put 0
it 0
in 0
a 0
box 0
for 0
him. 0

He 0
paid 0
me, 0
put 0
it 0
in 0

left." 0

Haig 0
said 0
he's 0
been 0
legally 0
selling 0
ammunition 0
as 0
as 0
a 0
hobby 0
since 0
1991, 0
but 0
after 0
the 0
massacre, 0
he 0
has 0
stopped 0
his 0
side 0
business. 0

It 0
wasn't 0
unusual 0
for 0
a 0
customer 0
to 0
buy 0
over 0
700 0
rounds, 0
he 0
said. 0

"I've 1
seen 1
all 1
kinds 1
of 1
people. 1

There 1
were 1
no 1
tells," 1
Haig 0
said 0
of 0
Paddock. 0

When 0
asked 0
about 0
the 0
threats, 0
Haig 0
said, 0
“I’ve 0
had 0
people 0
screaming 0
they 0
want 0
me 0
to 0
die 0
through 0
my 0
front 0
door." 0

Haig 0

did 0
not 0
immediately 0
respond 0
to 0
requests 0
for 0
comment 0
on 0
the 0
conspiracy 0
theorizing. 0

Haig 0
said 0
he's 0
sorry 0
that 0
the 0
massacre 0
took 0
place, 0
but 0
emphasized 0
that 0
he 0
had 0
nothing 0
to 0
do 0
with 0
Paddock's 0
mass 0
shooting. 0

“I 0
had 0
no 0
contribution 0
to 0
what 0
Paddock 0
did,” 0
Haig 0
said 0
at 0
the 0
news 0
conference. 0

“I 0
had 1
no 1
way 1
to 1
see 1
into 1
his 1
mind. 1

The 0
product 0
that 0
I 0
sold 0
him 0
had 1
absolutely 1
nothing 1
to 1
do 1
with 0
what 0
he 0
did.” 0

Nevertheless, 0
it's 0
hard 0
to 0
believe 0
that 0
Haig's 0
denials 0
will 0
dissuade 0
the 0
conspiracy-mongers. 0

for 0
all 0
he 0
knows, 0
Doug 0
Haig 0
didn't 0
play 0
a 0
role 0
in 0
Paddock's 0
massacre. 0

Even 0
so, 0
Morphonious 0
still 0
parlayed 0

of 0

"Did 1

That 0
