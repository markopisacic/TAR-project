You 0
don’t 0
have 0
to 0
look 0
far 0
for 0
fresh 0
news 0
about 0
Mars, 0
Saturn, 0
or 0
Jupiter 0
these 0
days, 0
but 0
Neptune 0
doesn’t 0
always 0
get 0
the 0
same 0
kind 0
of 0
attention. 0

The 0
big 0
frigid 0
blue 0
ball 0
is 0
the 0
farthest 0
planet 0
from 0
the 0
Sun 0
— 0
since 0
we 0
don’t 0
count 0
Pluto 0
as 0
a 0
planet 0
anymore 0
— 0
and 0
it 0
hasn’t 0
been 0
studied 0
with 0
the 0
same 0
intensity 0
of 0
many 0
of 0
the 0
others. 0

Thankfully 0
the 0
Hubble 0
Space 0
Telescope 0
hasn’t 0
lost 0
interest 0
in 0
the 0
distant 0
planet, 0
because 0
it 0
just 0
captured 0
one 0
of 0
Neptunes 0
massive 0
storms 0
losing 0
steam 0
as 0
it 0
roars 0
across 0
the 0
planet. 0

Storms 0
on 0
Neptune 0
appear 0
as 0
giant 0
dark 0
ovals, 0
a 0
bit 0
like 0
Jupiter’s 0
Great 0
Red 0
Spot. 0

However, 0
unlike 0
Jupiter’s 0
centuries-old 0
storm, 0
Neptune’s 0
hurricane-like 0
weather 0
events 0
only 0
last 0
a 0
few 0
years 0
at 0
a 0
time 0
before 0
eventually 0
dissipating. 0

Of 0
course, 0
that’s 0
not 0
to 0
say 0
the 0
storms 0
are 0
insignificant 0
— 0
many 0
are 0
large 0
enough 0
to 0
swallow 0
and 0
entire 0
continent 0
here 0
on 0
Earth 0
— 0
so 0
watching 0
one 0
breathe 1
its 1
dying 1
gasps 1
is 0
still 0
a 0
special 0
sight. 0

The 0
planet, 0
which 0
NASA 0
says 0
is 0
the 0
windiest 0
in 0
our 0
Solar 0
System, 0
hosts 0
regular 0
storms 0
which 0
appear 0
as 0
large 0
spots 0
on 0
its 0
surface, 0
but 0
scientists 0
are 0
still 0
at 0
a 0
loss 0
as 0
to 0
how 0
they 0
actually 0
occur. 0

“We 0
have 0
no 0
evidence 0
of 0
how 0
these 0
vortices 0
are 0
formed 0
or 0
how 0
fast 0
they 0
rotate,” 0
Agustín 0
Sánchez-Lavega 0
of 0
the 0
University 0
of 0
the 0
Basque 0
Country 0
in 0
Spain 0
explains. 0

“It 0
is 0
most 0
likely 0
that 0
they 0
arise 0
from 0
an 0
instability 0
in 0
the 0
sheared 0
eastward 0
and 0
westward 0
winds.” 0

The 0
observation 0
of 0
this 0
particular 0
storm 0
dying 0
out 0
is 0
significant 0
because 0
it’s 0
the 0
very 0
first 0
time 0
one 0
of 0
Neptune’s 0
storms 0
has 0
been 0
observed 0
in 0
such 0
a 0
way. 0

It 0
also 0
goes 0
against 0
everything 0
that 0
scientists 0
thought 0
they 0
knew 0
about 0
how 0
forms 0
on 0
Neptune 0
live 0
and 0
die. 0

“It 0
looks 0
like 0
we’re 0
capturing 0
the 0
demise 0
of 0
this 0
dark 0
vortex, 0
and 0
it’s 0
different 0
from 0
what 0
well-known 0
studies 0
led 0
us 0
to 0
expect,” 0
said 0
Michael 0
H. 0
Wong 0
of 0
the 0
University 0
of 0
California 0
at 0
Berkeley 0
says. 0

“Their 0
dynamical 0
simulations 0
said 0
that 0
anticyclones 0
under 0
Neptune’s 0
wind 0
shear 0
would 0
probably 0
drift 0
toward 0
the 0
equator. 0

We 0
thought 0
that 0
once 0
the 0
vortex 0
got 0
too 0
close 0
to 0
the 0
equator, 0
it 0
would 0
break 0
up 0
and 0
perhaps 0
create 0
a 0
spectacular 0
outburst 0
of 0
cloud 0
activity.” 0

But 0
this 0
storm 0
stayed 0
its 0
course, 0
dying 0
out 0
in 0
a 0
horizontal 0
path 0
that 0
didn’t 0
bring 0
it 0
towards 0
the 0
Neptunian 0
equator 0
at 0
all, 0
forcing 0
scientists 0
to 0
go 0
back 0
to 0
the 0
drawing 0
board 0
and 0
come 0
up 0
with 0
a 0
new 0
theory 0
on 0
the 0
planet’s 0
weather 0
habits. 0
