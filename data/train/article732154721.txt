Brushing 0
aside 0
any 0
semblance 0
of 0
political 0
correctness, 0
Hungary’s 0
Prime 0
Minister 0
said 0
in 0
his 0
state 0
of 0
the 0
nation 0
speech 0
on 0
Sunday 0
that, 0
“Christianity 1
is 1
Europe's 1
last 1
hope.” 1

Addressing 0
his 0
country 0
and 0
the 0
world, 0
Prime 0
Minister 0
Viktor 0
Orbán 0
warned 0
that 0
European 1
nations 1
which 1
have 1
encouraged 1
migration 1
have, 1
“opened 1
the 1
way 1
to 1
the 1
decline 1
of 1
Christian 1
culture 1
and 1
the 1
advance 1
of 1
Islam.” 1

Orbán 0
painted 0
an 0
image 0
of 0
Western 0
Europe 0
being 0
overwhelmed 0
by 0
the 0
accelerating 0
influx 0
Muslim 0
immigrants 0
in 0
recent 0
years. 0

“According 0
to 0
estimates, 0
the 0
proportion 0
of 0
immigrants 0
will 0
grow 0
at 0
an 0
accelerated 0
pace 0
in 0
the 0
European 0
countries 0
west 0
of 0
us,” 0
said 0
Orbán. 0

“I 0
won't 0
even 0
say 0
anything 0
about 0
France 0
and 0
Holland, 0
but 0
even 0
the 0
born 0
Germans 0
are 0
being 0
forced 0
back 0
from 0
most 0
large 0
German 0
cities 0
as 0
migrants 0
always 0
occupy 0
big 0
cities 0
first.” 0

Orbán 0
warned 0
that 0
as 0
Western 1
Europe 1
becomes 1
saturated 1
with 1
Muslim 1
occupants, 1
Islamists 1
would 1
soon 1
seek 1
to 1
stream 1
in 1
to 1
his 1
country 1
from 1
both 1
Western 1
Europe 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
from 1
Islamic 1
nations. 1

“This 0
means 0
that 0
the 1
Islamic 1
civilization, 1
which 1
always 1
considers 1
its 1
vocation 1
to 1
convert 1
Europe 1
to 1
what 1
it 1
calls 1
the 1
true 1
faith, 1
in 0
the 0
future 0
will 0
be 0
knocking 0
on 0
the 0
door 0
of 0
Central 0
Europe 0
not 0
only 0
from 0
the 0
south, 0
but 0
from 0
the 0
west, 0
as 0
well,” 0
he 0
said. 0

Prime 0
Minister 0
Orbán 0
said 0
his 0
government 0
will 0
oppose 0
efforts 0
by 0
the 0
United 0
Nations 0
or 0
the 0
European 0
Union 0
to 0
“increase 0
migration” 0
around 0
the 0
world. 0

In 0
June, 0
LifeSiteNews 0
reported 0
that 0
Orbán 0
had 0
taken 0
a 0
strong 0
stand 0
and 0
not 0
backed 0
down 0
against 0
outside 0
globalist 0
influences 0
seeking 0
to 0
control 0
his 0
nation’s 0
politics. 0

Billionaire 0
George 0
Soros, 0
who 0
famously 0
backs 0
many 0
progressive 0
initiatives 0
around 0
the 0
world, 0
locked 0
horns 0
with 0
Orbán 0
over 0
the 0
Central 0
European 0
University 0
(CEU) 0
he 0
founded 0
in 0
1989, 0
which 0
has 0
been 0
criticized 0
as 0
a 1
funnel 1
for 1
anti-nationalist 1
views. 1

Orbán 0
and 0
Soros 0
have 0
a 0
history, 0
beginning 0
in 0
partnership 0
and 0
ending 0
in 0
acrimony. 0

Orbán 0
started 0
public 0
life 0
as 0
a 0
crusader 0
against 0
communism 0
and 0
attended 0
Oxford 0
University 0
on 0
a 0
Soros 0
scholarship. 0

Soros, 0
who 0
expatriated 0
from 0
Hungary, 0
also 0
funded 0
Orbán’s 0
political 0
organization, 0
the 0
Alliance 0
for 0
Young 0
Democrats. 0

But 0
Orbán’s 0
defense 0
of 0
conservative 0
values 0
has 0
led 0
to 0
breaking 0
ties 0
with 0
Soros, 0
whom 0
he 0
now 0
criticizes 0
as 0
a 0
foreigner 1
meddling 1
in 1
his 1
country’s 1
affairs. 1

After 0
Prime 0
Minister 0
Orbán 0
delivered 0
his 0
strongly 0
worded 0
state 0
of 0
the 0
nation 0
speech, 0
a 0
UK 0
Daily 0
Mail 0
report 0
said, 0
“Orbán 0
has 0
conflated 0
the 0
issue 0
of 0
immigration 0
with 0
the 0
image 0
of 0
Soros, 1
87, 1
whose 1
name 1
was 1
used 1
in 1
a 1
tough 1
anti-migrant 1
bill 1
sent 0
to 0
Parliament 0
on 0
Wednesday.” 0

The 0
Daily 0
Mail 0
report 0
continued: 0

Soros, 0
for 0
his 0
part, 0
compared 1
Orbán 1
unfavourably 1
to 1
both 1
the 1
Nazis 1
and 1
the 1
Communists, 1
saying 0
his 0
rule 0
evoked 0
dark 0
tones 0
from 0
the 0
1930's, 0
when 0
Hungary 0
was 0
allied 0
with 0
Nazi 0
Germany. 0

But 0
Orbán 0
remains 0
committed 0
to 0
his 0
policy, 0
claiming 0
that 0
Soros 0
and 0
supporters 0
of 0
migration 0
are 0
losing 0
the 0
fight. 0

He 0
said: 0
“Soros 0
has 0
antagonised 0
not 0
only 0
us 0
but 0
also 0
England, 0
President 0
Trump 0
and 0
Israel 0
too. 0

Everywhere 0
he 0
wants 0
to 0
get 0
migration 0
accepted. 0

It 0
won't 0
work. 0

We 0
are 0
not 0
alone 0
and 0
we 0
will 0
fight 0
together 0
and 0
we 0
will 0
succeed.” 0

In 0
addition 0
to 0
inviting 0
Soros’ 0
ire, 0
Orbán 0
came 0
under 0
fire 0
a 0
couple 0
years 0
ago 0
from 0
the 0
U.S. 0
State 0
Department 0
under 0
President 0
Obama 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
the 0
European 0
Parliament 0
for 0
purportedly 0
discriminating 0
against 0
homosexuals 0
because 0
of 0
Hungary’s 0
insistence 0
on 0
defining 0
marriage 0
between 0
a 0
man 0
and 0
a 0
woman, 0
and 0
that 0
pre-born 0
babies 0
have 0
rights. 0

Last 0
year, 0
Orbán 0
also 0
criticized 0
liberals 0
and 0
encouraged 0
citizens 0
to 0
give 0
life 0
to 0
more 0
children 0
during 0
the 0
11th 0
conference 0
of 0
the 0
World 0
Congress 0
of 0
Families. 0

Three 0
thousand 0
“natural 0
family” 0
advocates 0
who 0
attended 0
the 0
four-day 0
conference 0
heard 0
Orbán 0
in 0
his 0
opening 0
address 0
lambaste 0
the 0
European 0
Union 0
(EU) 0
for 0
its 0
“relativizing 0
liberal 0
ideology 0
that’s 0
an 0
insult 0
to 0
families.” 0
