Nigel 0
Farage 0
once 0

convince 0
Britons 0
to 0
vote 0
for 0
Brexit 0
and 0
separate 0

everything 1
they 1

to 1

Now 0
Farage 0

if 1

can’t 1
beat 1
them, 1
he’ll 1

in 0

At 0
a 0
recent 0
dinner 0
of 0
the 0
UK 0
Independence 0
Party 0
(UKIP), 0
which 0
he 0
formerly 0
headed, 0
Farage 0
said: 0
“If 1
dealing 1
with 1
Islamic 1
fundamentalism 1
becomes 1
a 1
battle 1
between 1
us 1
and 1
the 1
entire 1
religion, 1
I’ll 1
tell 1
you 1
the 1
result: 1
we’ll 1
lose. 1

We 1
will 1
simply 1
lose….We 1
absolutely 1
have 1
to 1
get 1
that 1
Muslim 1
majority 1
living 1
in 1
many 1
of 1
our 1
towns 1
and 1
cities 1
on 1
our 1
side, 1
more 1
attuned 1
to 1
Western 1
values 1
than 1
some 1
pretty 1
hardline 1
interpretations 1
of 1
the 1
Qur’an.” 1

Sure. 1

Now 0
how 0
does 0
Farage 0
propose 0
to 0
do 0
that? 0

His 0
warning 0
against 0
making 0
the 0
resistance 0
to 0
jihad 0
a 1
“battle 1
between 1
us 1
and 1
the 1
entire 1
religion” 1
is 0
odd. 0

No 1
sane 1
person 1
is 1
saying 1
that 1
the 1
West 1
should 1
go 1
to 1
war 1
with 1
the 1
entire 1
Islamic 1
world. 1

The 0
likeliest 0
interpretation 0
of 0
his 0
statement 0
is 0
that 0
he 0
is 0
saying 0
that 0
we 0
must 0
not 0
speak 0
about 0
how 0
jihadis 1
find 0
justification 0
for 0
their 0
actions 0
in 0
the 0
Qur’an 0

But 1
if 1
we 1
don’t 1
speak 1
about 1
such 1

how 1
will 1
we 1
ever 1
convince 1
Muslims 1
not 1

“hardline 1

Another 1
problem 1
with 1
Farage’s 1
statement 1
is 1
that 1
it 1
manifests 1
a 1
remarkable 1
ignorance 1
of 1
history. 1

While 1
he 1
is 1
deeply 1
concerned 1
that 1
British 1
people 1
not 1
begin 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
resisting 1
jihad 1
terror 1
means 1
that 1
they 1
are 1
in 1
a 1
“battle” 1
with 1
the 1
“entire 1
religion” 1
of 1
Islam, 1
he 1
appears 1
unaware 1
of 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
many 1
Muslims 1
throughout 1
history 1
have 1
considered 1
their 1
entire 1
religion 1
to 1
be 1
at 1
war 1
with 1
the 1
entire 1
non-Muslim 1
world. 1

fifteenth-century 1
Persian 1
who 1
wrote 1
a 1
biography 1
of 1
the 1
Mongol 1
Muslim 1
warrior 1
Tamerlane, 1
observed 1
that 1
“the 1
Qur’an 1
says 1
the 1
highest 1
dignity 1
man 1
can 1
attain 1
is 1
that 1
of 1
making 1
war 1
in 1
person 1
against 1
the 1
enemies 1
of 1
his 1
religion. 1

Muhammad 1
advises 1
the 1
same 1
thing, 1
according 1
to 1
the 1
tradition 1
of 1
the 1
Muslim 1
doctors: 1
wherefore 0
the 0
great 0
Temur 0
always 0
strove 0
to 1
exterminate 1
the 1
infidels, 1
as 0
much 0
to 0
acquire 0
that 0
glory, 0
as 0
to 0
signalise 0
himself 0
by 0
the 0
greatness 0
of 0
his 0
conquests.” 0

After 0
conquest 0
came 0
dhimmitude, 0
the 0
subjugated 0
status 0
that 0
the 0
Qur’an 0
mandates 0
for 0
“the 1
People 1
of 1
the 1
Book” 1
(primarily 0
Jews 0
and 0
Christians). 0

In 0
the 0
early 0
twelfth 0
century, 0
the 0
Fatimid 1
caliph 1
Al-Amir 1
bi-Ahkamillah 1
issued 1
this 1
edict: 1

Now, 1
the 1
prior 1
degradation 1
of 1
the 1
infidels 1
in 1
this 1
world 1
before 1
the 1
life 1
to 1
come—where 1
it 1
is 1
their 1
lot—is 1
considered 1
an 1
act 1
of 1
piety; 1
and 1
the 1
imposition 1
of 1
their 1
poll 1
tax 1
[jizya], 1
“until 1
they 1
pay 1
the 1
tribute 1
out 1
of 1
hand 1
and 1
have 1
been 1
humbled” 1
(Koran 1
9:29) 1
is 1
a 1
divinely 1
ordained 1
obligation….The 1
dhimmi’s 1
payment 1
of 1
his 1
dues 1
by 1
a 1
bill 1
drawn 1
on 1
a 1
Muslim, 1
or 1
by 1
delegating 1
a 1
real 1
believer 1
to 1
pay 1
it 1
in 1
his 1
name 1
will 1
not 1
be 1
tolerated. 1

It 1
must 1
be 1
exacted 1
from 1
him 1
directly 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
vilify 1
and 1
humiliate 1
him, 1
so 1
that 1
Islam 1
and 1
its 1
people 1
may 1
be 1
exalted 1
and 1
the 1
race 1
of 1
infidels 1
brought 1
low. 1

The 1
jizya 1
is 1
to 1
be 1
imposed 1
on 1
all 1
of 1
them 1
in 1
full, 1
without 1
exception. 1

Underlying 0
this 0
subjugation 0
is 0
a 0
deep 0
contempt 0
for 0
non-Muslims. 0

In 0
the 0
year 0
718, 0
the 1
Umayyad 1
caliph 1
Umar 1
ibn 1
Abd 1
al-Aziz 1
sent 1
out 1
a 1
message 1
to 1
the 1
governors 1
of 1
the 1
various 1
Islamic 1
provinces: 1

O 1
you 1
who 1
believe! 1

The 1
non-Muslims 1
are 1
nothing 1
but 1
dirt. 1

Allah 1
has 1
created 1
them 1
to 1
be 1
partisans 1
of 1
Satan; 1
most 1
treacherous 1
in 1
regard 1
to 1
all 1
they 1
do; 1
whose 1
whole 1
endeavor 1
in 1
this 1
nether 1
life 1
is 1
useless, 1
though 1
they 1
themselves 1
imagine 1
that 1
they 1
are 1
doing 1
fine 1
work. 1

Upon 1
them 1
rests 1
the 1
curse 1
of 1
Allah, 1
of 1
the 1
Angels 1
and 1
of 1
man 1
collectively 1

We 0
must 0
not 0
think 0
that 0
we 0
are 0
at 1
war 1
with 1
the 1
entire 1
religion. 1

But 1
what, 1
Mr. 1
Farage, 1
are 1
we 1
to 1
think 1
about 1
the 1
Muslims 1
who 1
consider 1
themselves 1
and 1
their 1
religion 1
to 1
be 1
at 1
war 1
with 1
us? 1

Nigel 1
Farage 1
has 1
become 1
just 1
another 1
mainstream 1
hack 1
politician. 1
