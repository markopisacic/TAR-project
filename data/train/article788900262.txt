Jeanine 0
Pirro 0
spoke 0
to 0
Hannity 0
on 0
Thursday 0
night 0
and 0
asked, 0
"Since 0
when 0
does 0
truth 0
and 0
justice 0
or 0
guilt 0
and 0
innocence 0
depend 0
on 0
your 0
political 0
party. 0

I 1
fear 1
for 1
this 1
nation 1
when 1
this 1
is 1
now 1
the 1
standard. 1

You 1
believe 1
any 1
woman 1
who 1
goes 1
against 1
a 1
Republican 1
and 1
you 1
don't 1
believe 1
any 1
woman 1
who 1
goes 1
against 1
a 1
Democrat." 1

She 0
continued. 0

"I 0
worry 1
about 1
this 1
country. 1

I 0
don't 0
want 0
these 0
people 0
to 0
sit 0
on 0
juries. 0

It's 0
no 0
longer 0
about 0
truth 0
and 0
justice. 0

It's 0
about 0
politics." 0

Hannity 0
asks, 0
"Why 0
are 0
people 0
willing 0
to 0
throw 0
out 0
due 0
process, 0
equal 0
justice 0
under 0
the 0
law 0
and 0
the 0
presumption 0
of 0
innocence?" 0

Gregg 0
Jarrett 0
says 0
it's 0
"because 0
they're 1
zealous 1
to 0
the 0
point 0
where 0
they've 0
lost 0
their 0
common 0
sense." 0

Their 0
commentary 0
on 0
the 0
video 0
below 0
is 0
interesting. 0

Sen. 0
Charles 0
Grassley 0
(R-IA) 0
is 0
to 0
be 0
commended 0
on 0
his 0
handling 0
of 0
the 0
situation. 0

In 0
the 0
spirit 0
of 0
compromise, 0
he 0
called 0
off 0
the 0
Senate 0
committee 0
vote 0
that 0
had 0
been 0
on 0
the 0
calendar 0
for 0
Thursday 0
and 0
scheduled 0
a 0
hearing 0
for 0
next 0
Monday 0
so 0
that 0
both 0
Christine 0
Ford 0
and 0
Brett 0
Kavanaugh 0
could 0
state 0
their 0
cases. 0

Kavanaugh 0
immediately 0
responded 0
to 0
Grassley. 0

For 0
36 0
hours, 0
there 0
was 0
silence 0
from 0
the 0
Ford 0
camp. 0

Then, 0
their 0
demands 0
began. 0

First, 0
it 0
was 0
reported 0
that 0
Ford 0
would 0
answer 0
questions, 0
but 0
only 0
at 0
a 0
closed 0
hearing 0
and 0
only 0
after 0
an 0
FBI 0
investigation 0
had 0
been 0
completed. 0

Republicans 0
felt 0
that 0
the 0
request 0
for 0
a 0
closed 0
hearing 0
was 0
reasonable, 0
but 0
the 0
demand 0
for 0
a 0
new 0
FBI 0
investigation 0
was 0
not. 0

The 0
FBI 0
investigates 0
federal 0
crimes 0
and/or 0
national 0
security 0
issues. 0

When 0
the 0
FBI 0
received 0
Dianne 0
Feinstein’s 0
letter 0
last 0
week, 0
they 0
forwarded 0
it 0
to 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
to 0
place 0
in 0
Kavanaugh’s 0
background 0
check 0
file. 0

(Note: 0
The 0
FBI 0
has 0
already 0
conducted 0
six 0
background 0
checks 0
on 0
Kavanaugh, 0
the 0
most 0
recent 0
one 0
was 0
done 0
this 0
summer.) 0

It 0
was 0
announced 0
later 0
that 0
Sen. 0
Grassley 0
would 0
not 0
change 0
the 0
date 0
of 0
the 0
hearing 0
set 0
for 0
Monday. 0

Even 0
Senators 0
Jeff 0
Flake, 0
Bob 0
Corker 0
and 0
Lindsey 0
Graham, 0
who 0
have 0
all 0
said 0
Ford 0
needs 0
to 0
be 0
heard, 0
have 0
indicated 0
that 0
if 0
she 0
does 0
not 0
show 0
up 0
for 0
Monday's 0
hearing, 0
they 0
will 0
schedule 0
a 0
vote 0
on 0
Kavanaugh's 0
confirmation. 0

On 0
Thursday 0
afternoon, 0
Ford's 0
highly 1
partisan, 1
activist 1
attorney 1
emailed 0
Grassley 0
saying, 0
although 0
her 0
client 0
strongly 0
prefers 0
that 0
an 0
investigation 0
take 0
place 0
beforehand, 0
Ford 0
will 0
testify 0
next 0
week, 0
but 0
she 0
cannot 0
do 0
so 0
on 0
Monday. 0

And 0
she 0
will 0
only 0
be 0
questioned 0
by 0
members 0
of 0
the 0
Senate 0
panel, 0
not 0
outside 0
lawyers. 0

Why 1
not 1
Monday? 1

Does 1
she 1
have 1
an 1
important 1
dentist 1
appointment 1
she 1
can't 1
get 1
out 1
of? 1

In 0
order 0
to 0
avoid 0
the 0
criticism 0
that 0
will 0
no 0
doubt 0
come 0
anyway, 0
the 0
Republicans 0
on 0
the 0
Senate 0
Judicial 0
committee 0
have 0
tried 0
very 0
hard 0
to 0
oblige 0
Ford's 0
requests, 0
even 0
offering 0
to 0
go 0
to 0
California 0
to 0
hear 0
her 0
testimony. 0

She 0
and 0
her 0
attorneys 0
feel 0
that 0
they 0
are 0
in 0
the 0
driver's 0
seat 0
and 0
thus, 0
can 0
call 0
all 0
the 0
shots. 0

Democrats 1
want 1
to 1
delay 1
this 1
vote 1
until 1
after 1
the 1
midterms 1
because 1
they 1
believe 1
they 1
have 1
a 1
chance 1
to 1
retake 1
the 1
Senate 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
the 1
House. 1

Rush 0
Limbaugh 0
points 0
out 0
that 0
the 0
Senate 0
has 0
bent 1
over 1
backwards 1
to 0
accommodate 0
the 0
accuser. 0

"I 0
don’t 1
care 1
who 1
you 1
are, 1
determine 0
the 0
scope 0
and 0
the 0
parameters 0
of 0
an 0
investigation. 0

The 0
accuser 0
doesn’t 0
get 0
to 0
determine 0
when 0
and 0
who 0
investigates. 0

In 1
no 1
circumstance 1
in 1
the 1
country 1
does 1
that 1
happen." 1

In 0
addition 0
to 0
the 0
political 0
reasons 0
for 0
the 0
delay 0
requests, 0
it 0
appears 0
as 0
if 0
this 0
woman 0
is 0
reluctant 0
to 0
testify 0
under 0
oath, 0
possibly 0
because 0
she 0
doesn’t 0
want 0
to 0
perjure 0
herself. 0

Maybe 0
she 0
realizes 0
the 0
magnitude 0
of 0
what 0
her 0
accusations 0
have 0
unleashed. 0

Either 0
this 0
did 0
not 0
happen 0
at 0
all 0
or 0
a 0
much 0
milder 0
version 0
of 0
the 0
situation 0
she 0
alleges 0
occurred. 0

Kavanaugh 0
may 0
have 0
made 0
a 0
pass 0
at 0
her 0
as 0
17-year-old 0
boys 0
(and 0
even 0
some 0
17-year-old 0
girls) 0
are 0
known 0
to 0
do. 0

Ford 0
said 0
no 0
and 0
that 0
was 0
it. 0

Even 0
she 0
admits, 0
they 0
did 0
not 0
have 0
sex, 0
nor 0
was 0
this 0
a 0
hostage 0
situation. 0

The 0
perception 0
of 0
events 0
by 0
a 0
15-year-old 0
girl 0
may 0
differ 0
significantly 0
from 0
reality. 0

And 0
36 0
years 0
can 0
distort 0
memories, 0
one 0
way 0
or 0
another. 0

What 1
is 1
happening 1
in 1
the 1
Brett 1
Kavanaugh 1
nomination 1
process 1
should 1
concern 1
every 1
American. 1

Whatever 0
happened 0
or 0
did 0
not 0
happen, 0
it's 0
difficult 0
to 0
feel 0
sorry 0
for 0
someone 0
who 0
comes 0
forward 0
at 0
such 0
a 0
politically 0
opportune 0
moment. 0

There 0
was 0
ample 0
time 0
to 0
have 0
addressed 0
this 0
in 0
July 0
or 0
August, 0
but 0
Dianne 0
Feinstein 0
chose 1
to 1
sit 1
on 1
it 1
until 1
the 1
moment 1
it 1
could 1
inflict 1
maximum 1
political 1
damage. 1

Democrats 0
may 0
be 0
overestimating 0
the 0
strength 0
of 0
their 0
hand. 0

And 0
Ms. 0
Ford 0
may 0
be 0
overestimating 1
the 1
integrity 1
of 1
the 1
"supportive" 1
lawmakers 1
and 1
lawyers 1
currently 1
handling 1
her. 1

Watch 0
all 0
these 0
sensitive 1
lawmakers 1
and 1
high 1
profile, 1
activist 1
attorneys 1
scatter 1
like 1
mice 1
from 0
her 0
once 0
the 0
Senate 0
vote 0
is 0
over 0
(regardless 0
of 0
the 0
result). 0

Ford 0
can 0
choose 0
to 0
state 0
her 0
case 0
on 0
Monday 0
or 0
not, 0
but 0
she 0
is 0
not 0
in 0
a 0
position 0
to 0
be 0
calling 0
the 0
shots. 0
