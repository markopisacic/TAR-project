in 0 91 1
Madagascar 0 91 1
has 0 91 1
been 0 91 1
released. 0 91 1

Officials 0 91 2
warn 0 91 2
that 0 91 2
it’s 1 91 2
inevitable 1 91 2
that 1 91 2
this 1 91 2
bacterial 1 91 2

that’s 0 91 2
infected 0 91 2
over 0 91 2
2000 0 91 2

The 0 91 3
only 0 91 3
way 0 91 3

with 0 91 3
antibiotics. 0 91 3

But 0 91 4
experts 0 91 4
now 0 91 4
warn 0 91 4
that 0 91 4
because 0 91 4
they 0 91 4
are 0 91 4
being 0 91 4
used 0 91 4
so 0 91 4
much 0 91 4
to 0 91 4
treat 0 91 4
the 0 91 4
infection, 0 91 4
antibiotics 1 91 4
resistance 1 91 4
is 1 91 4
inevitable 1 91 4
and 0 91 4
making 1 91 4
this 1 91 4
disease 1 91 4
much 1 91 4
more 1 91 4
terrifying. 1 91 4

Once 0 91 5
the 0 91 5

is 0 91 5
resistant, 0 91 5
the 0 91 5
Madagascar 0 91 5
healthcare 0 91 5

will 0 91 5
be 0 91 5

the 0 91 6
Daily 0 91 6

Madagascar’s 1 91 6

be 1 91 6
unable 1 91 6

if 1 91 6
the 1 91 6

to 0 91 9

right 0 91 9
now, 0 91 9
drug 1 91 9

also 1 91 9
an 1 91 9
increasing 1 91 9
concern 1 91 9
amongst 0 91 9
experts 0 91 9
who 0 91 9

“Fortunately 0 91 10

not 0 91 10

If 1 91 11
that 1 91 11

in, 1 91 11
the 1 91 11

will 1 91 11
