Madagascar 0 0 4
has 0 0 4
suffered 0 0 4
bubonic 0 0 4
plague 0 0 4
outbreaks 0 0 4
almost 0 0 4
every 0 0 4

The 0 0 5
disease 0 0 5
tends 0 0 5
to 0 0 5

a 0 0 5

from 0 0 5

between 0 0 6

are 0 0 6

to 0 0 6

But 0 0 7
Tedros 0 0 7
voiced 0 0 7
alarm 0 0 7
that 0 0 7

in 0 0 7
a 1 0 7
very, 1 0 7
very 1 0 7
different 1 0 7
way 0 0 7
this 0 0 7
year." 0 0 7

Cases 0 0 8
sprang 0 0 8
up 0 0 8
far 0 0 8
earlier 0 0 8
than 0 0 8
usual 0 0 8
and, 0 0 8
instead 0 0 8
of 0 0 8
being 0 0 8
confined 0 0 8
to 0 0 8
the 0 0 8
countryside, 0 0 8
the 0 0 8
disease 0 0 8
infiltrated 0 0 8

towns. 0 0 9
The 0 0 9
authorities 0 0 9
recorded 0 0 9
more 0 0 9
than 0 0 9
2 0 0 9
000 0 0 9

and 0 0 9
Tedros 0 0 9
said 0 0 9
Wednesday 0 0 9
the 0 0 9
death 0 0 9
toll 0 0 9
stood 0 0 9
at 0 0 9

207. 0 0 10
He 1 0 10
also 1 0 10
pointed 1 0 10
to 1 0 10
the 1 0 10
presence 1 0 10
of 1 0 10
the 1 0 10
pneumonic 1 0 10
version, 1 0 10
which 1 0 10
spreads 1 0 10
more 1 0 10
easily 1 0 10
and 1 0 10
is 1 0 10
more 1 0 10
virulent, 1 0 10
in 1 0 10
the 1 0 10
latest 1 0 10
outbreak. 1 0 10

He 0 0 11
praised 0 0 11
the 0 0 11
rapid 0 0 11
response 0 0 11
from 0 0 11
WHO 0 0 11
and 0 0 11
Madagascar 0 0 11
authorities 0 0 11
that 0 0 11
helped 0 0 11
bring 0 0 11
the 0 0 11
outbreak 0 0 11
under 0 0 11
control, 0 0 11
but 1 0 11
warned 1 0 11
that 1 0 11
the 1 0 11
danger 1 0 11
was 1 0 11
not 1 0 11

over. 1 0 12
The 0 0 12
larger-than-usual 0 0 12
outbreak 0 0 12
had 0 0 12
helped 0 0 12
spread 0 0 12
the 0 0 12
bacteria 0 0 12
that 0 0 12
causes 0 0 12
the 0 0 12
plague 0 0 12
more 0 0 12

widely. 0 0 13
This 0 0 13
along 0 0 13
with 0 0 13
poor 0 0 13
sanitation 0 0 13
and 0 0 13
vector 0 0 13
control 0 0 13
on 0 0 13
Madagascar 0 0 13
meant 0 0 13
that 0 0 13
"when 1 0 13
(the 1 0 13
plague) 1 0 13
comes 1 0 13
again 1 0 13
it 1 0 13
starts 1 0 13
from 1 0 13
more 1 0 13
stock, 1 0 13
and 1 0 13
the 1 0 13
magnitude 1 0 13
in 1 0 13
the 1 0 13
next 1 0 13
transmission 1 0 13
could 1 0 13
be 1 0 13
higher 1 0 13
than 1 0 13
the 1 0 13
one 1 0 13
that 1 0 13
we 1 0 13
saw," 1 0 13
Tedros 0 0 13

said. 0 0 14
"That 0 0 14
means 0 0 14
that 0 0 14
Madagascar 0 0 14
could 0 0 14
be 0 0 14
affected 0 0 14
more, 0 0 14
and 0 0 14
not 0 0 14
only 0 0 14
that, 0 0 14
it 1 0 14
could 1 0 14
even 1 0 14
spill 1 0 14
over 1 0 14
into 1 0 14
neighbouring 1 0 14
countries 1 0 14
and 1 0 14
beyond," 1 0 14

he 0 0 15
warned. 0 0 15
Complicating 0 0 15
vector 0 0 15
control 0 0 15
is 0 0 15
the 0 0 15
fact 0 0 15
that 0 0 15
the 0 0 15
fleas 0 0 15
that 0 0 15
carry 0 0 15
the 0 0 15
Yersinia 0 0 15
pestis 0 0 15
bacteria 0 0 15
that 0 0 15
causes 0 0 15
the 0 0 15
plague 0 0 15
have 0 0 15
proven 0 0 15
to 0 0 15
be 0 0 15
widely 0 0 15
resistant 0 0 15
to 0 0 15
chemicals 0 0 15
and 0 0 15
insecticides. 0 0 15

"That's 0 0 15

a 0 0 15

dangerous 0 0 15

combination," 0 0 15
