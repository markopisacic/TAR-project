Trial 1
for 0
Kavanaugh 0

Two 0
more 0
women 0
accusing 0
Judge 0
Brett 0
Kavanaugh 0
of 0
dubious 0
improprieties 0
materialized 1
out 1
of 1
thin 1
air 1
late 0
Sunday, 0
throwing 0
Senate 0
Republicans’ 0
hope 0
of 0
finally 0
confirming 0
the 0
Supreme 0
Court 0
nominee 0
this 0
week 0
even 0
more 0
into 0
doubt. 0

The 0
new 0
allegations 0
came 0
yesterday 0
amid 0
reports 0
that 0
Senate 0
Judiciary 0
Committee 0
chairman 0
Chuck 0
Grassley 0
(R-Iowa) 0
tentatively 0
scheduled 0
a 0
hearing 0
for 0
this 0
Thursday 0
to 0
take 0
testimony 0
from 0
Christine 0
Blasey 0
Ford, 0
51, 0
who 0
claims 0
Kavanaugh, 0
53, 0
sexually 0
assaulted 0
her 0
decades 0
ago 0
when 0
he 0
was 0
a 0
high 0
school 0
student. 0

Suspiciously, 1
Ford 1
can’t 1
–or 1
won’t— 1
say 1
when 1
or 1
where 1
the 1
alleged 1
incident 1
happened 1
and 1
can 1
provide 1
few 1
details. 1

As 0
Paul 0
Sperry 0
writes 0
at 0
the 0
New 0
York 0
Post, 0
working 0
with 0
Sen. 0
Dianne 0
Feinstein 0
(D-Calif.) 0
and 0
backed 0
financially 0
by 0
George 0
Soros’s 0
money, 0
Ford’s 0
lawyers 0
spent 0
the 0
last 0
few 0
days 0
gaming 1
the 1
system. 1

After 0
stalling 0
Grassley 0
and 0
getting 0
repeated 0
extensions, 0
the 0
attorneys 0
got 0
the 0
chairman 0
to 0
cave 0
on 0
various 0
demands, 0
such 0
as 0
that 0
Kavanaugh 0
not 0
be 0
in 0
the 0
room 0
when 0
Ford 0
gives 0
evidence. 0

Republicans 0
never 0
seem 0
to 0
learn 0
from 0
their 0
mistakes. 0

As 0
usual, 0
Republicans’ 0
seeming 0
reasonableness 0
is 0
rewarded 0
with 0
more 0
abuse 0
by 0
the 0
Left. 0

Give 1
left-wingers 1
an 1
inch 1
and 1
they’ll 1
take 1
a 1
mile. 1

Democrats, 0
it 0
turns 0
out, 0
used 0
the 0
extra 0
time 0
created 0
through 0
their 0
delaying 0
tactics 0
to 0
produce 0
two 0
new 0
women 0
with 0
questionable 0
claims 0
against 0
Kavanaugh. 0

More 0
accusers 0
could 0
be 0
on 0
their 0
way. 0

President 0
Trump 0
continues 0
to 0
support 0
Kavanaugh, 0
who 0
maintains 0
his 0
innocence. 0

“This 0
alleged 0
event 0
from 0
35 0
years 0
ago 0
did 0
not 0
happen,” 0
the 0
nominee 0
said 0
Sunday 0
of 0
Ford’s 0
accusations. 0

“The 0
people 0
who 0
knew 0
me 0
then 0
know 0
that 0
this 0
did 0
not 0
happen, 0
and 0
have 0
said 0
so. 0

This 0
is 0
a 0
smear, 1
plain 0
and 0
simple. 0

I 0
look 0
forward 0
to 0
testifying 0
on 0
Thursday 0
about 0
the 0
truth, 0
and 0
defending 0
my 0
good 0
name 0
— 0
and 0
the 0
reputation 0
for 0
character 0
and 0
integrity 0
I 0
have 0
spent 0
a 0
lifetime 0
building 0
— 0
against 0
these 0
last-minute 0
allegations.” 0

If 0
Kavanaugh 0
isn’t 0
on 0
the 0
bench 0
on 0
October 0
1, 0
the 0
Supreme 0
Court 0
will 0
be 0
shorthanded 0
as 0
it 0
begins 0
hearing 0
cases 0
in 0
its 0
new 0
term. 0

The 0
high 0
court 0
normally 0
has 0
a 0
complement 0
of 0
nine 0
justices 0
but 0
with 0
Associate 0
Justice 0
Anthony 0
Kennedy’s 0
retirement 0
July 0
31, 0
which 0
cleared 0
the 0
way 0
for 0
Kavanaugh’s 0
nomination, 0
there 0
have 0
only 0
been 0
only 0
eight 0
justices 0
in 0
place. 0

Roughly 0
speaking 0
there 0
is 0
a 0
4-to-4 0
liberal 0
to 0
conservative 0
ideological 0
split 0
on 0
the 0
court. 0

Democrats 0
would 0
prefer 0
to 0
drag 0
the 0
confirmation 0
process 0
into 0
the 0
next 0
Congress 0
where 0
they 0
stand 0
a 0
good 0
chance 0
of 0
taking 0
control 0
from 0
Republicans. 0

Election 0
Day 0
is 0
November 0
6. 0

The 0
GOP 0
currently 0
controls 0
the 0
Senate, 0
which 0
has 0
the 0
final 0
say 0
on 0
judicial 0
nominations, 0
by 0
an 0
uncomfortably 0
close 0
margin 0
of 0
51 0
to 0
49. 0

Meanwhile, 0
the 0
New 0
Yorker 0
magazine 0
reported 0
Sunday 0
that 0
Deborah 0
Ramirez, 0
53, 0
suddenly 0
claims 0
to 0
have 0
been 0
assaulted 0
by 0
Kavanaugh 0
at 0
a 0
drunken 0
party 0
decades 0
ago 0
at 0
Yale 0
College. 0

Ramirez 0
claims 0
Kavanaugh 0
exposed 0
himself 0
to 0
her 0
and 0
brushed 0
his 0
genitals 0
against 0
her. 0

Also 0
on 0
Sunday, 0
media-savvy 1
sleazeball 1
lawyer 1
Michael 0
Avenatti, 0
who 0
represents 0
porn 0
star 0
Stormy 0
Daniels, 0
tweeted 0
that 0
he 0
represents 0
another 0
woman 0
who 0
plans 0
to 0
accuse 0
Kavanaugh 0
of 0
something. 0

“I 0
represent 0
a 0
woman 0
with 0
credible 0
information 0
regarding 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh 0
and 0
Mark 0
Judge. 0

We 0
will 0
be 0
demanding 0
the 0
opportunity 0
to 0
present 0
testimony 0
to 0
the 0
committee 0
and 0
will 0
likewise 0
be 0
demanding 0
that 0
Judge 0
and 0
others 0
be 0
subpoenaed 0
to 0
testify,” 0
Avenatti 0
wrote 0
on 0
Twitter. 0

“My 0
client 0
is 0
not 0
Deborah 0
Ramirez.” 0

Washington 0
insiders 0
still 0
believe 0
Kavanaugh 0
will 0
be 0
confirmed, 0
or 0
at 0
least 0
they 0
did 0
before 0
the 0
two 0
new 0
accusers 0
popped 0
up. 0

For 0
example, 0
at 0
a 0
Friday 0
afternoon 0
preview 0
of 0
upcoming 0
cases 0
in 0
the 0
Supreme 0
Court’s 0
approaching 0
October 0
term 0
that 0
was 0
hosted 0
by 0
the 0
Federalist 0
Society, 0
panelist 0
Thomas 0
C. 0
Goldstein 0
of 0
the 0
law 0
firm 0
of 0
Goldstein 0
& 0
Russell 0
predicted 0
that 0
the 0
high 0
court 0
would 0
have 0
nine 0
members 0
again 0
soon. 0

“There 0
is 0
exactly 1
a 1
zero 1
percent 1
chance 1
that 0
[Senate 0
Majority 0
Leader] 0
Mitch 0
McConnell 0
and 0
Chuck 0
Grassley 0
will 0
allow 0
this 0
thing 0
to 0
get 0
past 0
the 1
lame-duck” 1
congressional 0
session 0
after 0
Election 0
Day, 0
said 0
the 0
co-founder 0
of 0
SCOTUSblog 0
who 0
has 0
appeared 0
before 0
the 0
Supreme 0
Court 0
many 0
times. 0

“I 0
think 0
we 0
ought 0
to 0
recognize 0
that. 0

The 0
prospect 0
that 0
the 0
Democrats 0
will 0
take 0
the 0
Senate, 0
albeit 0
thin, 0
is 0
realistic, 0
and 0
so 0
they 0
will 0
do 0
whatever 0
is 0
necessary 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
make 0
sure 0
that 0
there 0
is 0
a 0
ninth 0
member 0
of 0
the 0
court 0
there 0
by 0
the 0
time 0
a 0
Democratic 0
majority 0
could 0
take 0
over 0
in 0
the 0
Senate 0
in 0
January.” 0

We’ll 0
see 0
soon 0
enough 0
if 0
Goldstein’s 0
prediction 0
comes 0
true. 0
