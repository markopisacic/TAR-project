An 0 164 1
outbreak 0 164 1
of 0 164 1
the 0 164 1
plague 0 164 1
in 0 164 1
Madagascar 0 164 1

spreading 0 164 1
at 0 164 1
an 0 164 1
unprecedented 1 164 1

With 0 164 2
the 0 164 2
ease 0 164 2
of 0 164 2
spreading 0 164 2
the 0 164 2
plague, 0 164 2
the 1 164 2
likelihood 1 164 2
that 1 164 2
this 1 164 2

will 1 164 2
move 1 164 2

the 1 164 2
planet 1 164 2
has 1 164 2
become 1 164 2
a 1 164 2
huge 1 164 2
concern 1 164 2
for 1 164 2
many. 1 164 2

So 0 164 3
far, 0 164 3
the 0 164 3
plague 0 164 3
has 0 164 3
claimed 0 164 3

and 0 164 3
infected 0 164 3
more 0 164 3

Madagascar’s 0 164 8

Plague 0 164 9
is 0 164 9
caused 0 164 9
by 0 164 9
infection 0 164 9
with 0 164 9
the 0 164 9
bacterium 0 164 9
Yersinia 0 164 9

frequently 0 164 9
carried 0 164 9
by 0 164 9
rats. 0 164 9

The 0 164 10
bacteria 0 164 10
will 0 164 10
eventually 0 164 10
end 0 164 10
up 0 164 10
causing 0 164 10
the 0 164 10
often 0 164 10

plague. 0 164 10

Symptoms 0 164 11

Pneumonic 0 164 12

The 0 164 13

The 0 164 14

According 0 164 15

the 0 164 15

They 0 164 16

And 0 164 17
while 0 164 17
the 0 164 17
country 0 164 17
experiences 0 164 17
regular 0 164 17
outbreaks, 0 164 17
with 0 164 17
an 0 164 17
estimated 0 164 17
400 0 164 17
cases 0 164 17
of 0 164 17
plague 0 164 17
each 0 164 17
year, 0 164 17
this 0 164 17

things 0 164 17
are 0 164 17
very 0 164 17

This 0 164 18
year, 0 164 18
health 0 164 18
officials 0 164 18
report 0 164 18
the 0 164 18
infections 0 164 18
started 0 164 18
much 0 164 18
earlier 0 164 18
than 0 164 18
usual, 0 164 18
and 0 164 18
they’re 0 164 18
occurring 0 164 18
in 0 164 18
new 0 164 18
areas, 0 164 18
including 0 164 18
urban 0 164 18
settings. 0 164 18

They’ve 0 164 19
also 0 164 19
seen 0 164 19
an 0 164 19
unexpected 0 164 19
number 0 164 19
of 0 164 19
cases 0 164 19
of 0 164 19
pneumonic 0 164 19

which 0 164 19

more 0 164 19

Historically 0 164 20
dubbed 0 164 20
the 0 164 20
“black 1 164 20
death” 1 164 20
the 0 164 20
bubonic 0 164 20
plague 0 164 20
has 0 164 20
been 0 164 20
responsible 0 164 20
for 0 164 20
several 0 164 20
worldwide 0 164 20
pandemics 0 164 20
in 0 164 20
the 0 164 20
past. 0 164 20

Early 0 164 21
detection 0 164 21
of 0 164 21
the 0 164 21
plague 0 164 21
is 0 164 21
key 0 164 21
since 0 164 21
both 0 164 21
forms 0 164 21
of 0 164 21
it 0 164 21
can 0 164 21
be 0 164 21
cured 0 164 21
with 0 164 21
antibiotics. 0 164 21

But, 0 164 22
occasionally 0 164 22
there 0 164 22
can 0 164 22
be 0 164 22
cases 0 164 22
of 0 164 22
septicemic 0 164 22
plague, 0 164 22
where 0 164 22
the 0 164 22
infection 0 164 22
has 0 164 22
spread 0 164 22
to 0 164 22
a 0 164 22
person’s 0 164 22
bloodstream 0 164 22
and 0 164 22
can 0 164 22
cause 0 164 22
bleeding 0 164 22
and 0 164 22
necrosis 0 164 22
of 0 164 22
tissue, 0 164 22
turning 0 164 22
