Jorge 0

in 0
Argentina 0
before 0
he 0
became 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
say 0
it 0

a 1
“classic” 1
move 1
of 1
his 1
to 0
provide 0
“mercy” 0
to 0
clergy 0

last 0

“I 0
think 0
this 0
is 0
a 0

It 0
is 0
mercy 0
for 0

has 0
handled 0
child 0
abuse 0
investigations 0
and 0
clergy 0
abuse 0
investigations 0
throughout 0
her 0
legal 0
career, 0
was 0
commenting 0
on 0
the 0
latest 0
sexual 0
abuse 0
case 0
to 0
touch 0
the 0
Francis 0
papacy, 0
in 0
this 0
case 0
where 0
the 0
Pope 0
appointed 0
a 0
bishop 0
with 0
a 0
history 0
of 0
complicity 0
in 0
child 0
sex 0
abuse. 0

The 0
Pope’s 0
claim 0
that 0
he 0
had 0
never 0
received 0
any 0
victim 0
testimony 0
regarding 0
the 0
complicity 0
of 0
Chilean 0
Bishop 0
Juan 0
Barros 0
in 0
child 0
sex 0
abuse 0
has 0
proven 0
to 0
be 0
false. 0

“The 0
Barros 0
case 0
is 0
putting 0
the 0
Pope, 0
for 0
the 0
first 0
time, 0
in 0
the 0
middle 0
as 0
a 0
principal 1
in 1
a 1
cover-up,” 1
Yore 0
said 0
during 0
the 0
interview. 0

Yore 0
said 0
that 0
not 0
only 0
is 0
it 0
now 0
known 0
that 0
the 0
Pope 0
received 0
a 0
letter 0
from 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
victims, 0
but 0
it 0
is 0
also 0
now 0
known 0
that 0
he 0
was 0
“told 0
from 0
the 0
moment 0
he 0
appointed 0
Bishop 0
Barros 0
in 0
2015 0
that 0
this 0
was 0
a 0
bad 0
decision.” 0

“The 0
Chilean 0
Archbishop 0
conference 0
told 0
him 0
to 0
revoke 0
this 0
appointment. 0

He 0
received 0
petitions 0
and 0
letters 0
and 0
calls, 0
yet, 0
ignored 0
them 0
all,” 0
she 0
said. 0

As 0
details 0
continue 0
to 0
surface, 0
the 0
pontiff’s 0
professed 0
empathy 0
for 0
abuse 0
victims 0
has 0
come 0
into 0
question 0
as 0
well. 0

Yore 0
called 0
the 0
child 0
sex 0
abuse 0
case 0
involving 0
infamous 1
Chilean 1
priest 1
abuser 1
Father 0
Fernando 0
Karadima 0
and 0
Bishop 0
Juan 0
Barros 0
“a 0
scandal 1
of 1
epic 1
proportions.” 1

The 0
scandal 0
signals 0
that 0
the 0
Church 0
under 0
Francis 0
is 0
slipping 0
backwards 0
in 0
its 0
handling 0
of 0
abuse, 0
said 0
Yore. 0

Yore 0
called 0
the 0
example 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
set 0
in 0
the 0
way 0
he 0
handled 0
the 0
abuse 0
information 0
“extremely 0
dangerous.” 0

“But 0
it 0
is 0
extremely 1
dangerous 1
as 0
the 0
head 0
of 0
the 0
Catholic 0
Church 0
— 0
you 0
know, 0
the 0
last 0
appeal 0
— 0
that 0
this 0
is 0
the 0
kind 0
of 0
behavior 0
that 0
is 0
going 0
to 0
be 0
mimicked 0
around 0
the 0
world 0
by 0
bishops, 0
[who 0
will 0
say] 0
‘Well 1
if 1
the 1
Pope 1
is 1
not 1
going 1
to 1
intervene 1
and 1
impose 1
zero 1
tolerance, 1
why 1
should 1
I?’” 0

Reports 0
say 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
personally 0
received 0
the 0
eight-page 0
letter 0
from 0
the 0
Chilean 0
victim 0
graphically 0
detailing 0
the 0
alleged 0
abuses 0
by 0
Karadima 0
and 0
linking 0
Barros 0
as 0
having 0
witnessed 0
and 0
covered 0
up 0
the 0
abuse. 0

The 0
alleged 0
abuse 0
took 0
place 0
decades 0
prior 0
to 0
Francis’s 0
2015 0
appointment 0
of 0
Barros 0
to 0
the 0
Diocese 0
of 0
Osorno 0
in 0
southern 0
Chile. 0

Pope 0
Francis 0
received 0
the 0
victim’s 0
letter 0
in 0
2015, 0
its 0
author 0
and 0
a 0
member 0
of 0
Francis’s 0
sex 0
abuse 0
commission 0
have 0
said, 0
contradicting 0
the 0
Pope’s 0
recent 0
insistence 0
that 0
no 0
victims 0
had 0
come 0
forward 0
in 0
the 0
matter 0
and 0
no 0
evidence 0
had 0
been 0
produced. 0

Francis 0
encountered 0
protests 0
in 0
Chile 0
over 0
his 0
defense 0
of 0
Barros 0
during 0
his 0
visit 0
there 0
last 0
month, 0
calling 0
the 0
accusations 0
against 0
the 0
priest 0
“calumny.” 1

While 0
Francis 0
later 0
apologized, 0
he 0
persisted 0
in 0
defending 0
Barros, 0
denying 0
that 0
he 0
had 0
received 0
any 0
testimony 0
himself 0
and 0
restating 0
that 0
such 0
unproven 0
accusations 0
are 0
“slander.” 1

The 0
Pope 0
later 0
said 0
he 0
would 0
send 0
Malta 0
Archbishop 0
Charles 0
Scicluna 0
– 0
the 0
former 0
top 0
Vatican 0
abuse 0
investigator 0
- 0
to 0
Chile 0
to 0
investigate 0
the 0
matter. 0

Expectations 0
were 0
high 0
in 0
2014 0
when 0
the 0
Pope 0
created 0
the 0
abuse 0
commission. 0

And 0
while 0
he 0
has 0
continually 0
condemned 0
clergy 0
sex 0
abuse 0
throughout 0
his 0
pontificate, 0
some 0
have 0
argued 0
his 0
actions 0
in 0
some 0
serious 0
cases 0
don’t 0
match 0
his 0
tough 0
stances 0
on 0
abuse. 0

Four 0
members 0
of 0
the 0
commission 0
had 0
met 0
with 0
Cardinal 0
O’Malley 0
in 0
2015, 0
conveying 0
their 0
objections 0
to 0
Francis’s 0
2015 0
appointment 0
of 0
Barros 0
as 0
bishop 0
of 0
Osorno. 0

It 0
was 0
at 0
the 0
meeting 0
with 0
O’Malley 0
that 0
the 0
abuse 0
commission 0
representatives 0
reportedly 0
gave 0
the 0
letter 0
to 0
the 0
cardinal 0
to 0
deliver 0
to 0
Francis, 0
and 0
O’Malley 0
later 0
confirmed 0
to 0
a 0
commission 0
member 0
that 0
he 0
had 0
in 0
fact 0
personally 0
delivered 0
the 0
letter 0
to 0
the 0
Pope. 0

Yore 0
explained 0
that 0
the 0
Pope 0
has 0
been 0
told 0
from 0
the 0
moment 0
he 0
appointed 0
Barros 0
in 0
2015 0
that 0
it 0
was 0
a 0
bad 0
decision, 0
between 0
the 0
Chilean 0
bishops’ 0
conference, 0
petitions, 0
letters 0
and 0
calls, 0
that 0
were 0
all 0
ignored. 0

Further, 0
a 0
Chilean 0
judicial 0
inquiry 0
found 0
all 0
the 0
victims 0
who 0
testified 0
— 0
including 0
the 0
letter’s 0
author 0
Juan 0
Carlos 0
— 0
to 0
be 0
credible, 0
and 0
that 0
there 0
was 0
a 0
major 0
cover-up 0
of 0
the 0
abuse 0
by 0
Father 0
Karadima. 0

Arroyo 0
spoke 0
with 0
Cruz 0
as 0
well, 0
who 0
said 0
he 0
was 0
“incredibly 1
frustrated” 1
when 0
Barros 0
was 0
going 0
to 0
be 0
appointed. 0

He’d 0
testified 0
about 0
three 0
bishops 0
who 0
had 0
witnessed 0
abuse, 0
he 0
said, 0
but 0
Barros 0
had 0
special 0
significance 0
for 0
him 0
because 0
Barros’ 0
part 0
went 0
beyond 0
witnessing 0
the 0
abuse, 0
to 0
violating 1
his 1
seal 1
of 1
Confession 1
with 1
Karadima 1
and 0
psychological 0
abuse 0
through 0
intimidation. 0

Cruz 0
recounted 0
how 0
he 0
and 0
other 0
victims 0
had 0
been 0
dismissed 0
or 0
slandered 0
by 0
local 0
Church 0
hierarchy 0
for 0
numerous 0
attempts 0
to 0
be 0
heard. 0

And 0
he 0
spoke 0
about 0
holding 0
out 0
hope 0
that 0
there 0
would 0
be 0
a 0
different 0
response 0
from 0
the 0
Pope, 0
discussing 0
specifics 0
of 0
getting 0
the 0
letter 0
to 0
the 0
Francis 0
via 0
Cardinal 0
O’Malley. 0

Cruz 0
told 0
Arroyo 0
he 0
was 0
really 0
hurt 0
and 0
felt 0
betrayed 0
by 0
the 0
Pope’s 0
comments 0
that 0
the 0
accusations 0
were 0
slander, 0
and 0
there 0
were 0
no 0
witnesses 0
or 0
evidence. 0

“To 0
hear 0
him 0
talk 0
about 0
us 0
that 0
way,” 0
Cruz 0
said, 0
“calling 0
us 0
slanderers, 0
it 0
was 0
terrible 0
because 0
it 0
set 0
the 0
clock 0
back 0
for 0
so 0
many 0
victims.” 0

Scicluna 0
will 0
be 0
meeting 0
with 0
Cruz, 0
who 0
said 0
he 0
hopes 0
other 0
abuse 0
survivors 0
will 0
be 0
heard 0
as 0
a 0
result 0
of 0
his 0
case 0
coming 0
more 0
to 0
the 0
forefront. 0

“This 0
leaves 0
us 0
with 0
very 0
strong 0
evidence 0
that 0
the 0
Pope 0
was, 0
in 0
fact, 0
aware 0
of 0
what 0
has 0
happened,” 0
Yore 0
said. 0

“Here 0
we 0
have 0
victims 0
10, 0
15 0
years 0
after 0
their 0
abuse, 0
begging 1
the 1
Pope, 1
having 0
to 0
take 0
pictures 0
of 0
a 0
letter 0
that’s 0
handed 0
to 0
a 0
cardinal 0
to 0
ensure 0
that 0
there 0
is 0
evidence 0
that 0
the 0
Pope 0
is 0
receiving 0
this 0
information.” 0

The 1
whole 1
of 1
Latin 1
America, 1
including 1
Argentina, 1
was 1
well 1
aware 1
of 1
what 1
was 1
happening 1
when 0
this 0
case 0
broke 0
in 0
Chile 0
in 0
2010, 0
Yore 0
noted, 0
and 0
yet 0
the 0
Pope 0
continues 0
to 0
shrug 0
his 0
shoulders 0
and 0
say 0
he 0
has 0
no 0
information. 0

This 0
was 0
precisely 0
what 0
he’d 0
been 0
saying 0
when 0
he 0
was 0
cardinal 0
and 0
archbishop 0
in 0
Buenos 0
Aires, 0
she 0
said, 0
that 0
no 0
one 0
ever 0
came 0
forward 0
with 0
information, 0
and 0
there 1
were 1
never 1
any 1
cases 1
of 1
clerical 1
abuse 1
in 1
the 1
entirety 1
of 1
the 1
two-million-plus 1
member 1
Archdiocese 1
of 1
Buenos 1
Aires. 1

“This 0
isn’t 0
just 0
simply 0
a 0
cover-up 0
of 0
a 0
predator 1
priest,” 1
Yore 0
stated. 0

“This 0
is 0
Barros 0
present, 0
in 0
the 0
room 0
when 0
the 0
abuse 0
is 0
ongoing 0
with 0
these 0
young 0
minor 0
boys.” 0

She 0
said 0
she 0
would 0
argue 0
as 0
a 0
child 0
advocate 0
that 0
Barros 0
was 0
involved 0
in 0
sexual 0
exploitation 0
of 0
children. 0

“So 0
I 0
don’t 0
think 0
this 0
is 0
simply 0
just 0
a 0
case, 0
as 0
bad 0
as 0
it 0
is, 0
of 0
a 0
cover-up 0
of 0
an 0
abuser,” 0
she 0
said. 0

“This 0
is 0
also 0
sexual 0
exploitation 0
of 0
children 0
in 0
a 1
grooming 1
gang, 1
a 1
predator 1
priest. 1

This 0
is 0
why 0
it 0
is 0
so 0
heinous.” 1

Yore 0
said 0
that 0
given 0
the 0
Church’s 0
sex 0
abuse 0
crisis, 0
one 0
would 0
have 0
thought 0
going 0
into 0
the 0
2013 0
conclave 0
(which 0
elected 0
Francis) 0
that 0
an 0
obvious 0
priority 0
in 0
vetting 0
candidates 0
for 0
the 0
papacy 0
would 0
have 0
meant 0
a 0
serious 0
look 0
at 0
their 0
history 0
of 0
handling 0
abuse 0
allegations 0
in 0
their 0
previous 0
sees. 0

There 0
are 0
more 0
cases 0
out 0
there 0
just 0
like 0
Barros 0
that 0
have 0
been 0
covered 0
up, 0
Yore 0
told 0
Arroyo, 0
maybe 0
even 0
some 0
even 0
worse 0
than 0
the 0
Barros 0
case. 0

“Those 0
cases 0
are 0
going 0
to 1
be 1
haunting 1
this 1
papacy 1
and 0
really 0
causing 0
a 0
rift 0
in 0
the 0
major 0
protection 0
of 0
children 0
that 0
Pope 0
Benedict 0
had 0
worked 0
very 0
hard 0
to 0
really 0
build 0
up,” 0
she 0
said. 0

“Trust 0
within 0
the 0
faithful 0
and 0
to 0
put 0
in 0
a 0
system 0
that 0
was 0
going 0
to 0
root 0
out 0
the 0
predators. 0

And 0
I 0
think 0
that 0
has 0
just 0
been 0
blown 0
up 0
and 0
I 0
think 0
we 0
are 0
back 0
to 0
square 0
one 0
in 0
the 0
Vatican." 0
