the 1

the 1

he 0

But 0
no 0
one 0
will 0
take 0
any 0

notice 0

this. 0

They 0
should, 0
however. 0

Khecharem 0
is 0
not 0
some 0
deluded 0
fanatic 0
raving 0
on 0
a 0
Tunisian 0
street 0
corner. 0

He 0
was 0
speaking 0
at 0
Hizb 0
ut-Tahrir’s 0
International 0
Caliphate 0
Conference; 0
although 0
Hizb 0
ut-Tahrir 0

banned 0
in 0
many 0
countries, 0
it 0
still 0
has 0
an 0
international 0
presence, 0
and 0
recently 0
held 0
a 0
conference 0
in 0
Chicago. 0

Nor 0
is 0
the 0
desire 0
to 0
establish 0
a 0
global 0
caliphate 0
limited 0
to 0
Hizb 0

The 0
word 0
khalifa 0
means 0
“successor”; 0
the 0
caliph 0
in 0
Sunni 0
Islamic 0

is 0
the 0

of 0
Muhammad 0
as 0
the 0
military, 0
political, 0
and 0
spiritual 0
leader 0
of 0
the 0
Muslims. 0

As 0
I 0
show 0
in 0
my 0
book 0
The 0
History 0
of 0
Jihad 0
From 0
Muhammad 0
to 0
ISIS 0
, 0
the 0
great 0
caliphates 0
of 0
history, 0
from 0
the 0
immediate 0
post-Muhammad 0
period 0
of 0
the 0
“Rightly 0
Guided 0
Caliphs” 0
to 0
the 0
Umayyads, 0
Abbasids, 0
and 0
Ottomans, 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
other 0
Islamic 0
states, 0
all 0
waged 0
relentless 0
jihad 0
warfare 0
against 0
non-Muslims, 0
subjugating 0
them 0
under 0
the 0
rule 0
of 0
Islamic 0
law 0
and 0
denying 0
them 0
basic 0
rights. 0

These 0
weren’t 0
the 0
actions 0
of 0
a 1
“tiny 1
minority 1
of 1
extremists,” 1
abhorred 1
by 1
the 1
vast 1
majority 1
of 1
peaceful 1
Muslims 1
for 1
“hijacking” 1
their 1
religion. 1

This 0
was, 0
for 0
fourteen 0
centuries, 0
mainstream, 0
normative 0
Islam, 0
carried 0
forth 0
by 0
the 0
primary 0
authorities 0
in 0
the 0
Islamic 0
world 0
at 0
the 0
time. 0

The 0
History 0
of 0
Jihad 0
shows 0
from 0
the 0
accounts 0
of 0
eyewitnesses 0
and 0
contemporary 0
chroniclers 0
through 0
the 0
ages 0
that 0
in 0
every 0
age 0
and 0
in 0
every 0
place 0
where 0
there 0
were 0
Muslims, 0
some 0
of 0
them 0
believed 0
that 0
they 0
had 0
a 0
responsibility 0
given 0
to 0
them 0
by 0
Allah 0
to 0
wage 0
war 0
against 0
and 0
subjugate 0
unbelievers 0
under 0
the 0
rule 0
of 0
Islamic 0
law. 0

And 0
so 0
it 0
is 0
today: 0
Said 0
Khecharem 0
has 0
enunciated 0
that 0
responsibility 0
more 0
clearly 0
and 0
directly 0
than 0
most 0
Muslim 0
spokesmen 0
do 0
these 0
days, 0
but 0
he 0
is 0
by 0
no 0
means 0
the 0
only 0
one 0
who 0
believes 0
that 0
it 0
exists. 0

What 0
is 0
noteworthy 0
also 0
about 0
The 0
History 0
of 0
Jihad 0
is 0
something 0
that 0
it 0
does 0
not 0
contain. 0

As 0
the 0
jihadis 0
move 0
against 0
non-Muslim 0
states 0
without 0
any 0
letup, 0
pause, 0
period 0
of 0
coexistence, 0
period 0
of 0
tolerance, 0
reformation, 0
or 0
reconsideration, 0
there 0
never 0
appears 0
any 0
force 0
of 0
Muslims 0
to 0
oppose 0
them. 0

While 0
it 0
is 0
undoubtedly 0
true 0
that 0
not 0
all 0
Muslims 0
in 0
any 0
given 0
age 0
have 0
ever 0
waged 0
jihad, 0
there 0
has 0
never 0
been 0
in 0
Islamic 0
history 0
an 0
Islamic 0
entity 0
or 0
organization 0
that 0
was 0
opposed 0
to 0
waging 0
jihad 0
and 0
dedicated 0
to 0
stopping 0
those 0
who 0
were 0
waging 0
it. 0

So 0
it 0
is 0
today. 0

Islamic 0
groups 0
in 0
the 0
West 0
issue 0
pro-forma 0
condemnations 0
after 0
every 0
jihad 0
terror 0
attack, 0
but 0
are 0
doing 0
little 0
or 0
nothing 0
to 0
try 0
to 0
prevent 0
the 0
next 0
one. 0

There 1
is 1
still 1
no 1
mosque 1
or 1
Islamic 1
school 1
in 1
the 1
United 1
States 1
that 1
teaches 1
young 1
Muslims 1
why 1
they 1
should 1
reject 1
the 1
understanding 1
of 1
Islam 1
taught 1
by 1
al-Qaeda, 1
ISIS, 1
and 1
other 1
jihad 1
terror 1
groups. 1

Meanwhile, 0
Said 0
Khecharem 0
and 0
other 0
Islamic 0
spokesmen 0
openly 0
call 0
for 0
Muslims 0
to 0
engage 0
in 0
jihad 0
conquest. 0

Western 0
authorities 0
should 0
be 0
pondering 0
his 0
words, 0
and 0
their 0
implications, 0
very 0
carefully. 0

Instead, 0
if 0
they 0
have 0
taken 0
any 0
notice 0
of 0
him 0
at 0
all, 0
which 0
is 0
unlikely, 0
they 0
have 0
dismissed 0
him 0
as 0
an 1
“extremist.” 1

They 1
have 1
yet 1
to 1
come 1
to 1
grips 1
with 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
“extremism” 1
is 1
and 1
always 1
has 1
been 1
so 1
distressingly 1
widespread 1
in 1
Muslim 1
communities. 1

But 1
they 1
will. 1
