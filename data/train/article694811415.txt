A 0
caller 0
to 0
the 0
Michael 0
Savage 0
radio 0
show 0
who 0
says 0
he 0
was 0
neighbors 0
with 0
Las 0
Vegas 0
gunman 0
Stephen 0
Paddock 0
asserts 0
that 0
Paddock 1
could 1
not 1
have 1
carried 1
out 1
the 1
massacre 1
and 0
that 0
it 0
was 0
actually 0
a 0
“set-up”. 0

The 0
man, 0
a 0
former 0
Marine 0
who 0
called 0
himself 0
Rick, 0
says 0
he 0
was 0
Paddock’s 0
neighbor 0
between 0
December 0
2015 0
and 0
June 0
2016 0
in 0
Mesquite, 0
Nevada. 0

“I 0
can 1
tell 1
you 1
100% 1
this 1
is 1
not 1
that 1
kind 1
of 1
guy,” 1
said 0
Rick, 0
adding 0
that 0
he 0
would 0
see 0
Paddock 0
every 0
other 0
day 0
and 0
that 0
the 0
two 0
would 0
go 0
to 0
a 0
local 0
bar 0
and 0
play 0
slot 0
machines. 0

“He 0
never 0
even 0
told 0
me 0
that 0
he 0
owned 0
a 0
gun,” 0
continued 0
the 0
shooter’s 0
neighbor, 0
adding 0
that 0
Paddock 0
did 0
not 0
express 0
any 0
religious 0
or 0
political 0
opinions 0
during 0
their 0
conversations. 0

“I’m 1
not 1
a 1
big 1
conspiracy 1
theory 1
guy, 1
but 1
it 1
don’t 1
sit 1
right,” 1
said 0
Rick, 0
before 0
making 0
the 0
extraordinary 0
claim 0
that 0
the 0
whole 0
shooting 0
was 0
a 0
“set 0
up” 0
and 0
that 0
Paddock’s 1
body 1
may 1
have 1
been 1
left 1
in 1
the 1
hotel 1
room 1
while 1
other 1
assailants 1
carried 1
out 1
the 1
shooting. 1

The 0
caller 0
mentioned 0
how 0
some 0
people 0
in 0
the 0
crowd 0
were 0
warned 0
45 0
minutes 0
before 0
the 0
shooting 0
that 0
they 0
were 0
going 0
to 0
die, 0
suggesting 0
that 0
this 0
was 0
evidence 0
of 0
a 0
wider 0
plot 0
and 0
not 0
a 0
“lone 0
wolf” 0
attack. 0

As 0
a 0
firearms 0
expert, 0
he 0
also 0
questioned 0
the 0
lack 0
of 0
flashes 0
coming 0
from 0
the 0
hotel 0
windows 0
where 0
the 0
shooter 0
was 0
supposedly 0
firing 0
from. 0

Rick 0
said 0
he 0
had 0
already 0
contacted 0
the 0
Clark 0
County 0
Sheriff’s 0
Office 0
to 0
relay 0
all 0
the 0
information 0
he 0
knew. 0

Although 0
the 0
claims 0
are 0
intriguing, 0
it 0
is 0
important 0
to 0
remember 0
that 0
after 1
virtually 1
every 1
terror 1
attack 1
and 1
mass 1
shooting, 1
friends 1
and 1
neighbors 1
express 1
shock 1
that 0
the 0
culprit 0
would 0
be 0
capable 0
of 0
carrying 0
out 0
such 0
horrors, 0
with 0
some 0
outright 0
denying 0
it 0
to 0
be 0
possible. 0

If 0
Paddock 0
was 0
planning 0
such 0
a 0
sophisticated 0
operation 0
and 0
hoping 0
to 0
evade 0
detection, 0
he 0
would 0
not 0
be 0
blabbing 0
details 0
about 0
it 0
to 0
his 0
neighbors. 0

However, 0
the 0
neighbor’s 0
claims 0
are 0
certain 0
to 0
attract 0
more 0
attention 0
given 0
that 0
no 0
specific 0
motive 0
has 0
yet 0
to 0
be 0
uncovered 0
for 0
the 0
shooting. 0
