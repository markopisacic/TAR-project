Newly 0
released 0
footage 0
of 0
the 0
Las 0
Vegas 0
Massacre, 0
captured 0
by 0
a 0
private 0
surveillance 0
camera 0
and 0
recently 0
released 0
by 0
Fox 0
News 0
host 0
Tucker 0
Carlson, 0
has 0
once 0
again 0
ignited 0
the 0
theory 0
that 0
helicopters 0
were 0
used 0
during 0
the 0
horrific 0
attack. 0

Over 0
the 0
last 0
month 0
multiple 0
videos 0
have 0
been 0
released 0
that 0
many 0
believe 0
show 0
helicopters 0
either 0
conducting 0
an 0
attack 0
on 0
the 0
Vegas 0
Strip 0
or 0
attempting 0
to 0
stop 0
those 0
that 0
were 0
and 0
now, 0
with 0
this 0
latest 0
evidence 0
release, 0
that 0
possibility 0
seems 0
all 0
the 0
more 0
plausible. 0

As 0
Shepard 0
Ambellas 0
reported 0
for 0
Intellihub, 0
“The 0
[footage] 0
is 0
presumed 0
to 0
have 0
been 0
captured 0
by 0
a 0
nearby 0
business’s 0
southward 0
facing 0
security 0
camera 0
which 0
is 0
located 0
approximately 0
780 0
feet 0
due 0
east 0
of 0
the 0
venue 0
where 0
the 0
Route 0
91 0
Harvest 0
Music 0
Festival 0
was 0
held 0
on 0
Oct. 0
1. 0

The 0
tape 0
was 0
given 0
to 0
Fox 0
News 0
by 0
an 0
attorney 0
who 0
represents 0
several 0
shooting 0
victims.” 0

Amazingly, 1
the 0
surveillance 0
camera 0
captured 0
what 0
seems 0
to 0
show 0
a 0
“large 0
amount” 0
of 0
wind 0
and 0
debris 0
being 0
kicked 0
up 0
by 0
a 0
nearby 0
helicopter 0
hovering 0
above 0
the 0
attack 0
and 0
or 0
taking 0
part 0
in 0
it. 0

“Astonishingly, 0
between 0
the 0
times 0
of 0
10:13 0
and 0
10:16 0
a 0
good 0
amount 0
of 0
debris 0
can 0
be 0
seen 0
being 0
pushed 0
downward 0
and 0
sideways 0
in 0
front 0
of 0
the 0
camera,” 0
Ambellas 0
continued. 0

“By 0
10:14 0
much 0
larger 0
crowds 0
of 0
people 0
can 0
be 0
seen 0
streaming 0
through 0
the 0
area 0
to 0
escape 0
the 0
massacre 0
going 0
on,” 0
Carlson 0
reported. 0

“You 0
can 0
see 0
a 0
large 0
amount 0
of 0
wind 0
and 0
debris, 0
apparently 0
that 0
is 0
due 0
to 0
a 0
helicopter 0
hovering 0
overhead.” 0

The 0
footage 0
goes 0
how 0
to 0
show 0
two 0
men 0
attempt 0
to 0
help 0
a 0
victim 0
who 0
had 0
apparently 0
been 0
shot, 0
eventually 0
resorting 0
to 0
covering 0
up 0
the 0
body 0
after 0
they 0
realized 0
it 0
was 0
simply 0
too 0
late. 0

Ambellas 0
also 0
reported 0
on 0
what 0
his 0
research 0
indicates 0
were 0
documented 0
helicopters 0
in 0
the 0
air 0
at 0
the 0
time. 0

A 0
quick 0
review 0
of 0
flight 0
records 0
during 0
that 0
time 0
reveals 0
that 0
a 0
squadron 0
of 0
EC-130 0
Eurocopters 0
departed 0
from 0
Maverick 0
Leasing 0
LLC 0
at 0
10:12 0
p.m., 0
several 0
of 0
which 0
appear 0
to 0
have 0
overflown 0
the 0
parking 0
lot 0
where 0
the 0
victim 0
and 0
debris 0
were 0
seen. 0

However, 0
the 0
departure 0
of 0
the 0
choppers 0
and 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
several 0
of 0
them 0
overflew 0
the 0
parking 0
lot 0
does 0
not 0
explain 0
all 0
of 0
the 0
debris 0
being 0
kicked 0
up 0
from 0
by 0
a 0
heavy 0
downdraft, 0
prop 0
wash, 0
possibly 0
from 0
a 0
helicopter 0
hovering 0
in 0
place 0
much 0
closer. 0

In 0
fact, 0
the 0
downdraft 0
appears 0
to 0
be 0
constant 0
from 0
10:13-10:16 0
p.m. 0
and 0
not 0
intermittent 0
as 0
if 0
several 0
choppers 0
had 0
just 0
passed 0
overhead. 0

As 0
I 0
have 0
reported 0
in 0
the 0
past, 0
multiple 0
other 0
videos 0
taken 0
on 0
the 0
night 0
of 0
the 0
attack 0
also 0
seem 0
to 0
point 0
to 0
helicopters 0
being 0
used 0
throughout 0
the 0
city. 0

“Footage 0
has 0
emerged 0
that 0
may 0
show 0
muzzle 0
flashes 0
coming 0
from 0
the 0
helicopter 0
in 0
what 0
looks 0
to 0
be 0
evidence 0
that 0
a 0
team 0
was 0
firing 0
into 0
the 0
crowd 0
from 0
the 0
air 0
on 0
that 0
fateful 0
night,” 0
read 0
a 0
report 0
in 0
The 0
Daily 0
Sheeple. 0

“Despite 0
claims 0
by 0
some 0
that 0
these 0
are 0
“strobes” 1
it 1
remains 1
unlikely 1
that 0
this 0
is 0
the 0
case, 0
especially 0
when 0
you 0
consider 0
other 0
footage 0
of 0
the 0
helicopter 0
taken 0
on 0
the 0
night 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
research 0
by 0
a 0
group 0
of 0
investigators 0
who 0
believe 0
the 0
first 0
attack 0
on 0
October 0
1st 0
was 0
carried 0
out 0
from 0
the 0
air.” 0

It 0
is 0
also 0
important 0
to 0
keep 0
in 0
mind 0
that 0
there 0
is 0
footage 0
of 0
a 0
still 0
unidentified 0
team 0
loading 0
up 0
gear 0
in 0
a 0
helicopter 0
near 0
the 0
scene 0
of 0
the 0
attack. 0

“In 0
what 0
can 0
only 0
be 0
described 0
as 0
a 0
“WTF 1
video” 1
the 0
following 0
footage 0
seems 0
to 0
literally 0
show 0
a 0
team 0
of 0
unknown 0
soldiers 0
gearing 0
up 0
next 0
to 0
a 0
helicopter 0
near 0
the 0
Route 0
91 0
concert.” 0

Additionally, 0
Carlson 0
also 0
noted 0
during 0
the 0
initial 0
broadcast 0
of 0
the 0
private 0
surveillance 0
footage 0
that 0
the 0
owner 0
of 0
the 0
camera 0
was 0
never 0
approached 0
by 0
the 0
FBI, 0
who 0
have 0
so 0
far 0
never 0
seen 0
the 0
footage, 0
much 0
less 0
investigated 0
it. 0

While 1
we 1
may 1
never 1
know 1
what 0
actually 0
happened 0
during 0
the 0
Las 0
Vegas 0
Massacre, 0
the 1
fact 1
remains 1
that 1
the 1
official 1
story 1
has 1
been 1
proven, 1
time 1
and 1
time 1
again, 1
to 1
be 1
absolutely 1
false 1
and 1
in 1
fact 1
nothing 1
more 1
than 1
a 1
pathetic 1
attempt 1
at 1
a 1
cover-up. 1
