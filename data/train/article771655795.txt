Gun 0
control 0
is 0
the 0
dream 0
of 0
every 0
wannabe 1
statist 1
dictator 1
and 1
naive 1
do-gooder 1
alike. 0

The 1
latter 1
think 1
that 1
removing 1
guns 1
will 1
suddenly 1
force 1
humanity 1
to 1
stop 1
all 1
animosity 1
toward 1
one 1
another, 1
hold 1
hands, 1
and 1
sing 1
Kumbaya. 1

The 1
former 1
recognizes 1
that 1
an 1
armed 1
populace 1
is 1
a 1
threat 1
to 1
any 1
tyrant 1
and 1
pushes 1
for 1
gun 1
control 1
out 1
of 1
self-preservation. 1

up. 0

Less 0

received 0

from 0
the 0

that 1

Wilson 1
was 1
accused 1

just 1
as 1
if 1
he’d 1

“If 0
code 0
is 0
speech, 0
the 0
constitutional 0
contradictions 0
are 0
evident,” 0
Wilson 0
explained 0
to 0
WIRED 0
when 0
he 0
first 0
launched 0
the 0
lawsuit 0
in 0
2015. 0

“So 1
what 1
if 1
this 1
code 1
is 1
a 1
gun?” 1

The 0
Department 0
of 0
Justice’s 0
surprising 0
settlement, 0
confirmed 0
in 0
court 0
documents 0
earlier 0
this 0
month, 0
essentially 0
surrenders 0
to 0
that 0
argument. 0

It 0
promises 0
to 0
change 0
the 0
export 0
control 0
rules 0
surrounding 0
any 0
firearm 0
below 0
.50 0
caliber—with 0
a 0
few 0
exceptions 0
like 0
fully 0
automatic 0
weapons 0
and 0
rare 0
gun 0
designs 0
that 0
use 0
caseless 0
ammunition—and 0
move 0
their 0
regulation 0
to 0
the 0
Commerce 0
Department, 0
which 0
won’t 0
try 0
to 0
police 0
technical 0
data 0
about 0
the 0
guns 0
posted 0
on 0
the 0
public 0
internet. 0

In 0
the 0
meantime, 0
it 0
gives 0
Wilson 0
a 0
unique 0
license 0
to 0
publish 0
data 0
about 0
those 0
weapons 0
anywhere 0
he 0
chooses. 0

“I 0
consider 0
it 0
a 0
truly 0
grand 0
thing,” 0
Wilson 0
says. 0

“It 1
will 1
be 1
an 1
irrevocable 1
part 1
of 1
political 1
life 1
that 1
guns 1
are 1
downloadable, 1
and 1
we 1
helped 1
to 1
do 1
that.” 1
