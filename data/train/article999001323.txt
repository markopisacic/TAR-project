credential 0

CNN 0
has 0
won 0
the 0
first 0
round 0
of 0
its 0
legal 0
battle 0
to 0
get 0
correspondent 0
Jim 0
Acosta 0
back 0
in 0
the 0
White 0
House. 0

U.S. 0
District 0
Court 0
Judge 0
Timothy 0
Kelly 0
granted 0
the 0
cable 0
news 0
network’s 0
request 0
for 0
a 0
temporary 0
restraining 0
order 0
and 0
preliminary 0
injunction 0
Friday 0
that 0
restored 0
Acosta’s 0
White 0
House 0
press 0
credential. 0

Kelly 0
ordered 0
that 0
Acosta 0
be 0
reinstated 0
immediately. 0

He 0
did 0
not 0
rule 0
on 0
CNN’s 0
claim 0
that 0
the 0
revocation 0
of 0
the 0
journalist’s 0
pass 0
violated 0
his 0
rights 0
under 0
the 0
First 0
Amendment. 0

But 0
he 0
said 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
did 0
not 0
provide 0
Acosta 0
with 0
due 0
process 0
to 0
legally 0
remove 0
his 0
pass. 0

The 0
ruling 0
followed 0
a 0
court 0
hearing 0
held 0
Wednesday 0
in 0
Washington, 0
where 0
lawyers 0
for 0
CNN 0
and 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
faced 0
off 0
over 0
the 0
issue 0
of 0
press 0
access. 0

CNN 0
had 0
the 0
broad 0
support 0
of 0
other 0
news 0
organizations 0
that 0
believed 0
the 0
White 0
House’s 0
actions 0
posed 0
a 0
challenge 0
to 0
press 0
freedom. 0

“We 0
are 0
gratified 0
with 0
this 0
result 0
and 0
we 0
look 0
forward 0
to 0
a 0
full 0
resolution 0
in 0
the 0
coming 0
days,” 0
a 0
CNN 0
representative 0
said 0
in 0
a 0
statement. 0

“Our 0
sincere 0
thanks 0
to 0
all 0
who 0
have 0
supported 0
not 0
just 0
CNN, 0
but 0
a 0
free, 1
strong 1
and 1
independent 1
American 1
press.” 1

The 0
White 0
House 0
said 0
it 0
would 0
abide 0
by 0
Kelly’s 0
ruling. 0

“Today, 0
the 0
court 0
made 0
clear 0
there 0
is 0
no 0
absolute 0
right 0
to 0
access 0
the 0
White 0
House. 0

In 0
response 0
to 0
the 0
court, 0
we 0
will 0
temporarily 0
reinstate 0
the 0
reporter’s 0
hard 0
pass,” 0
White 0
House 0
press 0
secretary 0
Sarah 0
Huckabee 0
Sanders 0
said 0
in 0
a 0
statement. 0

“We 0
will 0
also 0
further 0
develop 0
rules 0
and 0
processes 0
to 0
ensure 0
fair 0
and 0
orderly 0
press 0
conferences 0
in 0
the 0
future. 0

There 0
must 0
be 0
decorum 0
in 0
the 0
White 0
House.” 0

Acosta’s 0
press 0
credential 0
was 0
revoked 0
by 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
on 0
Nov. 0
7 0
after 0
a 0
testy 1
exchange 0
with 0
President 0
Donald 0
Trump 0
at 0
a 0
White 0
House 0
news 0
conference. 0

At 0
one 0
point, 0
Acosta 0
refused 0
to 0
relinquish 0
the 0
microphone 0
to 0
a 0
White 0
House 0
aide 0
who 0
tried 0
to 0
retrieve 0
it 0
from 0
him. 0

It 0
was 0
the 0
latest 0
in 0
a 0
series 0
of 0
public 0
confrontations 0
between 0
Acosta 0
and 0
Trump, 0
who 0
has 0
repeatedly 0
characterized 0
CNN’s 0
critical 0
coverage 0
of 0
him 0
as 0
“fake 1
news” 1
since 0
the 0
2016 0
presidential 0
campaign. 0

CNN’s 0
suit 0
filed 0
Tuesday 0
says 0
the 0
suspension 0
of 0
Acosta’s 0
credential 0
violates 0
the 0
First 0
Amendment’s 0
protection 0
of 0
free 0
speech. 0

It 0
also 0
says 0
the 0
way 0
the 0
administration 0
revoked 0
the 0
pass, 0
with 0
no 0
direct 0
notice 0
to 0
Acosta 0
or 0
a 0
written 0
explanation 0
detailing 0
the 0
decision, 0
violated 0
the 0
Fifth 0
Amendment’s 0
protection 0
of 0
due 0
process 0
and 0
the 0
federal 0
Administrative 0
Procedures 0
Act. 0

“This 0
severe 1
and 0
unprecedented 1
punishment 0
is 0
the 0
culmination 0
of 0
years 0
of 0
hostility 0
by 0
President 0
Trump 0
against 0
CNN 0
and 0
Acosta 0
based 0
on 0
the 0
contents 0
of 0
their 0
reporting 0
— 0
an 0
unabashed 1
attempt 0
to 0
censor 0
the 0
press 0
and 0
exclude 0
reporters 0
from 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
who 0
challenge 0
and 0
dispute 0
the 0
president’s 0
point 0
of 0
view,” 0
the 0
suit 0
says. 0

Responding 0
to 0
the 0
CNN 0
suit, 0
lawyers 0
for 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
said 0
the 0
Trump 0
administration 0
had 0
broad 0
discretion 0
to 0
regulate 0
access 0
to 0
journalists 0
and 0
other 0
members 0
of 0
the 0
public. 0

“If 0
the 0
president 0
wants 0
to 0
exclude 0
all 0
reporters 0
from 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
grounds, 0
he 0
has 0
the 0
authority 0
to 0
do 0
that,” 0
Deputy 0
Assistant 0
Attorney 0
General 0
James 0
Burnham 0
said 0
during 0
the 0
hearing. 0

“There’s 0
no 0
First 0
Amendment 0
right.” 0

The 0
White 0
House 0
argued 0
that 0
Acosta’s 0
behavior, 0
which 0
it 0
described 0
as 0
rude 1
and 0
aggressive, 1
was 0
the 0
reason 0
for 0
revoking 0
his 0
credential. 0

Mark 0
Lukasiewicz, 0
dean 0
of 0
The 0
Lawrence 0
Herbert 0
School 0
of 0
Communication 0
at 0
Hofstra 0
University 0
and 0
a 0
former 0
network 0
news 0
executive, 0
praised 0
the 0
judge’s 0
decision, 0
which 0
he 0
said 0
was 0
not 0
a 0
surprise. 0

“The 0
White 0
House 0
has 0
lots 0
of 0
other 0
ways 0
to 0
deal 0
with 0
the 0
behavior 0
of 0
reporters 0
if 0
that’s 0
their 0
concern, 0
but 0
closing 0
the 0
gate 0
to 0
a 0
news 0
organization 0
is 0
not 0
one 0
of 0
these 0
ways, 0
and 0
it’s 0
important 0
that 0
the 0
court 0
stood 0
up 0
and 0
said 0
that,” 0
Lukasiewicz 0
said. 0

“It’s 0
not 0
the 0
first 0
time 0
a 0
reporter 0
has 0
behaved 0
in 0
a 0
way 0
that 0
a 0
president 0
doesn’t 0
like.” 0

Lukasiewicz 0
believed 0
CNN 0
would 0
reach 0
a 0
compromise 0
with 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
rather 0
than 0
engage 0
in 0
a 0
prolonged 0
court 0
battle. 0

“The 0
law 0
and 0
the 0
Constitution 0
is 0
very 0
clear 0
here,” 0
he 0
said. 0

CNN’s 0
suit 0
received 0
the 0
support 0
of 0
more 0
than 0
a 0
dozen 0
news 0
organizations 0
including 0
Fox 0
News, 0
where 0
commentators 0
have 0
often 0
echoed 0
Trump’s 0
criticisms 0
of 0
the 0
network’s 0
coverage. 0

Rival 0
news 0
organizations 0
came 0
to 0
the 0
defense 0
of 0
Fox 0
News 0
in 0
2009 0
when 0
the 0
Obama 0
administration 0
attempted 0
to 0
exclude 0
its 0
reporters 0
from 0
interviews 0
with 0
officials 0
that 0
were 0
offered 0
to 0
all 0
other 0
outlets. 0

Fox 0
News 0
commentators 0
were 0
President 0
Barack 0
Obama’s 0
harshest 0
critics 0
during 0
his 0
eight 0
years 0
in 0
office, 0
and 0
he 0
often 0
complained 0
about 0
it 0
in 0
public 0
and 0
private. 0

But 0
the 0
press 0
credentials 0
for 0
its 0
conservative-leaning 0
network 0
were 0
never 0
revoked. 0

Fox 0
News, 0
The 0
Washington 0
Post, 0
NBC 0
News, 0
The 0
Associated 0
Press 0
and 0
the 0
Los 0

Times 0
are 0
among 0
the 0
entities 0
that 0
have 0
said 0
they 0
will 0
file 0
amicus 0
briefs 0
on 0
behalf 0
of 0
CNN. 0
