“We 0
want 0
a 0
system 0
where 0
when 0
people 0
come 0
in 0
illegally, 0
they 0
have 0
to 0
go 0
out,” 0
Trump 0
told 0
reporters. 0

“A 0
nice 0
simple 0
system 0
that 0
works.” 0

Trump 0
said 0
that 0
the 0

that 0

by 0
holding 0
them 0
a 0

I 0
completely 0
agree. 0

In 0
fact, 0
I've 0
often 0
said 0
if 0
we 0
catch 0
people 0
close 0
to 0
the 0
border, 0
we 0
should 0
not 0
even 0
bring 0
them 0
into 0
the 0
system 0
if 0
they 0
are 0
not 0
citizens, 0
but 0
walk 0
them 0
back 0
over 0
the 0
border 0
and 0
make 0
sure 0
they 0
keep 0
walking. 0

Often, 0
by 0
putting 0
illegals 0
into 0
the 0
system, 0
it 0
takes 0
years 0
to 0
deport 0
them, 0
which 0
costs 0
the 0
American 1
people 1
lots 0
of 0
money. 0

That 0
system 0
would 0
require 0
more 0
judges 0
to 0
handle 0
more 0
illegals 0
and 0
Trump 0
ripped 0
the 0
calls 0
for 0
more 0
judges 0
in 0
favor 0
of 0
a 0
more 0
"simple 0
immigration 0
plan." 0

“We 0
want 0
strong 0
borders 0
and 0
we 0
want 0
no 0
crime,” 0
Trump 0
said. 0

“The 1
Democrats 1
want 1
open 1
borders 1
and 1
they 1
don’t 1
care 1
about 1
crime.” 1

Trump 0
then 0
called 0
on 0
Congress 0
to 0
correct 0
the 0
problems 0
created 0
by 0
legislation 0
with 0
more 0
legislation. 0

“The 0
laws 0
are 0
obsolete, 0
the 0
laws 0
are 0
horrible, 1
having 0
to 0
do 0
with 0
the 0
border, 0
both 0
in 0
terms 0
of 0
security 0
and 0
in 0
terms 0
of 0
taking 0
care 0
of 0
people,” 0
he 0
said. 0

“We 1
want 1
children 1
staying 1
together,” 1
Trump 0
said, 0
blasting 0
the 0
New 0
York 0
Times 0
report 0
that 0
said 0
he 0
didn't 0
really 0
want 0
to 0
sign 0
his 0
executive 0
order 0
last 0
week 0
that 0
would 0
keep 0
families 0
together 0
in 0
detention 0
while 0
they 0
awaited 0
the 0
judicial 0
process. 0

Of 0
course, 0
Trump 0
has 0
inherited 0
a 0
problem 0
that 0
has 0
existed 0
for 0
several 0
administrations, 0
both 0
Republican 0
and 0
Democrat, 0
for 0
decades. 0

It 0
is 0
time 0
that 0
Congress 0
sure 0
up 0
things 0
so 0
that 0
America's 1
tax 1
dollars 1
are 0
not 0
bound 0
up 0
in 0
a 0
worthless 1
judicial 0
process 0
when 0
people 0
are 0
clearly 0
in 0
the 0
country 0
illegally. 0

Sadly, 0
too 0
many 0
people 0
want 0
more 0
amnesty 0
which 0
begs 0
the 0
question 0
if 0
any 0
of 0
them 0
take 0
the 0
law 0
seriously 0
in 0
the 0
first 0
place. 0
