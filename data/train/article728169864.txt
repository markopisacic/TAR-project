The 0
Democratic 0
Party 0
promotes 0
itself 0
as 0
an 0
advocacy 0
group 0
for 0
all 0
matters 0
concerning 0

issues 0
such 0
as 0
same-sex 0
marriage, 0
as 0
bigots. 0

Yet, 0
the 0
party 0
keeps 0
on 0
inviting 0
an 0
imam, 0
who 0
has 0
a 0
long 0
record 0
of 0
hostility 0
toward 0
homosexuals, 0
to 0
participate 0
at 0
its 0
annual 0

This 0
blatant 1
hypocrisy 1
shows 0
the 0
political 0
bankruptcy 0
of 0
their 0
leadership’s 0
claims 0
to 0
be 0
pro-gay 0
and 0
anti-bigotry 0
and 0
reveals 0
their 0
intention 0
to 0
pander 0

those 0

community 0
who 0
spew 0
intolerance 0
and 0

and 0
an 0

The 0

Maulana 0
Shafayat 0

is 0
notorious 0
for 0
his 0
unapologetic 0
vilification 0
of 0

Darul 0

Institute, 0
located 0
in 0
Pembroke 0
Pines, 0
Florida. 0

The 0

been 0
a 0

for 0

a 0

role 0
in 0
his 0

history 0
– 0
and 0
he 0
has 0
been 0
around 0
for 0
all 0
of 0
it 0
– 0
Shafayat 0
Mohamed’s 0
personal 0
history 0
deals 0
much 0
more 0
in 0

than 0
terror. 0

One 0
stop 0
on 0
Shafayat 0
Mohamed’s 0
Facebook 0
page 0
and 0
one 0
can 0
view 0
his 0
profile 0
photo 0
of 0
him 0
holding 0
a 0
dark 0
green 0
book 0
with 0
gold 0
border 0
and 0
letters 0
on 0
the 0
cover. 0

The 0
book 0
is 0
“The 0
Meaning 0
of 0
THE 0
HOLY 0
QUR’AN,” 0
a 0
version 0
of 0
the 0
Quran 0
that 0
was 0
banned 0
by 0
the 0
Los 0
Angeles 0
public 0
school 0
system, 0
in 0
February 0
2002, 0
for 0
containing 0
numerous 0
anti-Semitic 0
commentaries. 0

In 0
it, 0
Jews 0
are 0
described 0
as: 0
“arrogant,” 1
“jealous,” 1
“selfish,” 1
“spiteful,” 1
“greedy,” 1
“cursed,” 1
“apes 1
and 1
swine,” 1
and 0
“under 1
divine 1
displeasure.” 1

This 1
may 1
seem 1
an 1
innocent 1
mistake 1
on 1
the 1
imam’s 1
part, 1
but 1
his 1
actions 1
against 1
the 1
gay 1
community 1
and 1
sinister 1
views 1
are 1
anything 1
but. 1

In 0
February 0
2005, 0
an 0
article 0
written 0
by 0
Shafayat 0
Mohamed 0
was 0
published 0
on 0
the 0
Darul 0
Uloom 0
website, 0
entitled 0
‘Tsunami: 0
Wrath 0
of 0
God.’ 0
In 0
it, 0
he 0
claims 0
that 0
gay 0
sex 0
caused 0
the 0
2004 0
Indonesian 0
tsunami 0
and 0
that 0
most 0
Jews 0
and 0
Christians, 0
whom 0
he 0
refers 0
to 0
as 0
“People 0
of 0
the 0
Book,” 0
are 0
“perverted 1
transgressors.” 1

It 0
is 0
writings 0
such 0
as 0
these 0
that 0
have 0
gotten 0
Shafayat 0
Mohamed 0
thrown 0
off 0
a 0
number 0
of 0
Broward 0
County 0
boards. 0

Even 0
so, 0
the 0
imam 0
has 0
been 0
unrepentant. 0

In 0
a 0
speech 0
he 0
gave 0
at 0
Darul 0
Uloom, 0
in 0
August 0
2015, 0
titled 0
‘Quraan 0
Torah 0
Bible 0
Forbid 0
Man 0
Marrying 0
Man,’ 0
he 0
admitted 0
that 0
he 0
“got 0
sacked 0
from 0
many 0
[county] 0
boards, 0
because 0
there 0
were 0
a 0
lot 0
of 0
gay 0
people 0
who 0
said, 0
‘We 0
don’t 0
want 0
him 0
on 0
that 0
board.’” 0
He 0
said 0
he 0
had 0
a 0
choice, 0
to 0
“sit 0
in 0
Paradise 0
or… 0
sit 0
on 0
the 0
board 0
and 0
go 0
to 0
Hell.” 0

He 0
began 0
his 0
speech 0
by 0
attacking 0
President 0
Barack 0
Obama 0
for 0
supporting 0
same-sex 0
marriage. 0

He 0
asked 0
the 0
following, 0
“Did 0
you 0
hear 0
what 0
President 0
Obama 0
said?… 0
Do 0
you 0
know 0
what 0
a 0
sad 0
situation 0
we 0
are 0
in 0
this 0
country?... 0

Here 0
you 0
have 0
the 0
President 0
of 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
of 0
America 0
saying 0
that 0
a 0
man 0
could 0
marry 0
a 0
man?… 0
Are 0
we 0
sleeping? 0

Do 0
you 0
believe 0
in 0
the 0
Quran? 0

Are 0
we 0
gonna 0
sit 0
and 0
have 0
the 0
Quran 0
be 0
ridiculed?” 0
He 0
then 0
cited 0
the 0
Christian 0
and 0
Jewish 0
Bible, 0
barking 1
loudly, 0
“The 0
Bible 0
says 0
that 0
if 0
a 0
man 0
sleeps 0
with 0
a 0
man, 0
he 0
should 0
be 0
killed!” 0

Shafayat 0
Mohamed 0
later 0
lamented 0
the 0
existence 0
of 0
Muslim 0
homosexuals. 0

He 0
decried, 0
“Listen. 0

Don’t 0
deny 0
it. 0

They 0
already 0
got 0
Muslim 0
gay 0
communities.” 0
He 0
as 0
well 0
spoke 0
of 0
his 0
support 0
for 0
polygamy, 0
an 0
act 0
that 0
is 0
illegal 0
in 0
the 0
United 0
States. 0

He 0
exclaimed, 0
“Here 0
the 0
President 0
says 0
a 0
man 0
can 0
marry 0
a 0
man, 0
but 0
you 0
can’t 0
say 0
a 0
man 0
can 0
have 0
four 0
wives…!” 0

The 0
October 0
TKJ 0
Dinner 0
was 0
not 0
the 0
first 0
Democrat 0
event 0
Shafayat 0
Mohamed 0
has 0
participated 0
in. 0

In 0
fact, 0
he 0
has 0
been 0
involved 0
in 0
many, 0
including 0
giving 0
the 0
invocations 0
at 0
the 0
Florida 0
Democratic 0
Party’s 0
annual 0
Leadership 0
Blue 0
Gala 0
in 0
2014 0
(featuring 0
Bill 0
Clinton), 0
2015 0
and 0
2016. 0

And 0
given 0
that 0
this 0
author 0
has 0
written 0
about 0
this 0
before, 0
the 0
October 0
event 0
will 0
probably 0
not 0
be 0
the 0
last 0
occasion 0
that 0
he 0
is 0
embraced 0
by 0
the 0
Democratic 0
Party. 0

Shafayat 0
Mohamed 0
is 0
not 0
the 0
only 0
Muslim 0
extremist 0
that 0
has 0
participated 0
in 0
the 0
Democratic 0
Party’s 0
TKJ 0
Dinner. 0

In 0
October 0
2015, 0
the 0
dinner 0
invocation 0
was 0
performed 0
by 0
Wilfredo 0
Amr 0
Ruiz, 0
the 0
legal 0
adviser 0
of 0
the 0
American 0
Muslim 0
Association 0
of 0
North 0
America 0
(AMANA), 0
a 0
group 0
that 0
actively 0
promotes 0
former 0
KKK 0
leader 0
and 0
white 1
supremacist 1
David 0
Duke. 0

Ruiz, 0
as 0
well, 0
founded 0
AMANA’s 0
Connecticut 0
and 0
Puerto 0
Rico 0
chapters. 0

In 0
July 0
2010, 0
the 0
Anti-Defamation 0
League 0
(ADL) 0
condemned 0
Ruiz’s 0
AMANA 0
for 0
posting 0
what 0
the 0
ADL 0
called 0
a 0
“venomous” 1
anti-Semitic 0
Duke 0
video 0
onto 0
the 0
group’s 0
official 0
website. 0

AMANA 0
is 0
currently 0
promoting 0
another 0
anti-Semitic 0
Duke-produced 0
video, 0
on 0
the 0
AMANA 0
site. 0

The 0
President 0
of 0
AMANA, 0
Sofian 0
Zakkout, 0
has 0
referred 0
to 0
Duke 0
as 0
“David 0
Duke, 0
a 1
man 1
to 1
believe 1
in!” 1

By 0
inviting 0
people 0
like 0
Shafayat 0
Mohamed, 0
an 0
avowed 0
enemy 0
of 0
the 0
gay 0
community, 0
and 0
Wilfredo 0
Ruiz, 0
whose 0
group 0
promotes 0
white 0
supremacists, 0
to 0
participate 0
in 0
its 0
functions, 0
the 0
Democratic 0
Party 0
has 0
effectively 0
revealed 0
its 0
disregard 0
for 0
the 0
concerns 0
of 0
those 0
it 0
disingenuously 0
claims 0
to 0
advocate 0
for 0
and 0
protect. 0

It 0
is 0
time 0
for 0
Democrats 0
to 0
reject 0
the 0
bigotry 0
of 0
these 0
radicals 0
and 0
see 0
them 0
for 0
the 0
liability 0
they 0
present. 0

Failure 1
to 1
do 1
so 1
exposes 1
the 1
party’s 1
liberal 1
agenda 1
as 1
a 1
