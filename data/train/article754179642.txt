Ebola 0
is 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
world's 0
most 0
notorious 0
diseases, 0
being 0
both 0
highly 1
infectious 1
and 1
extremely 1
lethal. 1

It 0
is 0
caused 0
by 0
a 0
virus 0
that 0
has 0
a 0
natural 0
reservoir 0
in 0
the 0
bat, 0
which 0
does 0
not 0
itself 0
fall 0
ill, 0
but 0
can 0
pass 0
the 0
microbe 0
on 0
to 0
humans 0
who 0
hunt 0
it 0
for 0
"bushmeat". 0

The 0
virus 0
is 0
handed 0
on 0
by 0
contact 0
with 0
bodily 0
fluids 0
-- 0
touching 0
a 0
sick 0
or 0
dead 0
person 0
is 0
a 0
well-known 0
source 0
of 0
infection. 0

Following 0
an 0
incubation 0
period 0
of 0
between 0
two 0
and 0
21 0
days, 0
Ebola 0
develops 0
into 0
a 0
high 0
fever, 0
weakness, 0
intense 0
muscle 0
and 0
joint 0
pain, 0
headaches 0
and 0
a 0
sore 0
throat. 0

That 0
is 0
often 0
followed 0
by 0
vomiting 0
and 0
diarrhoea, 0
skin 0
eruptions, 0
kidney 0
and 0
liver 0
failure, 0
and 0
internal 0

The 0
worst-ever 0
Ebola 0
outbreak 0
started 0
in 0
December 0
2013 0
in 0
southern 0
Guinea 0
before 0
spreading 0
to 0
two 0
neighbouring 0
west 0
African 0
countries, 0
Liberia 0
and 0
Sierra 0
Leone. 0

That 0
outbreak 0
killed 0
more 0
than 0
11,300 0
people 0
out 0
of 0
nearly 0
29,000 0
registered 0
cases, 0
according 0
to 0
WHO 0
estimates, 0
although 0
the 0
real 0
figure 0
is 0
thought 0
to 0
be 0
significantly 0
higher. 0

More 0
than 0
99 0
percent 0
of 0
victims 0
were 0
in 0
the 0
three 0
West 0
African 0
countries, 0
although 0
cases 0
occurred 0
in 0
other 0
parts 0
of 0
the 0
world, 0
often 0
stirring 0
panic. 0

There 0
is 0
no 0
current 0
vaccine 0
to 0
prevent 0
Ebola 0
or 0
licensed 0
treatment 0
for 0
it, 0
although 0
a 0
range 0
of 0
experimental 0
drugs 0
are 0
in 0
development. 0

Early 0
care 0
with 0
rehydration 0
may 0
boost 0
the 0
chance 0
of 0
survival. 0

Given 0
the 0
lack 0
of 0
a 0
pharmaceutical 0
weapon 0
against 0
Ebola, 0
health 0
experts 0
have 0
responded 0
with 0
time-honoured 0
measures 0
of 0
control, 0
prevention 0
and 0
containment. 0

They 0
use 0
rigorous 0
protocols 0

protect 0
medical 0
personnel 0
with 0
