including 0
by 0
threatening 0
them 0
not 0
to 0
cooperate 0
with 0
authorities, 0
TheDCNF 0
previously 0
reported. 0

In 0
April 0
2016, 0
the 0
House’s 0
Chief 0
Administrative 0
Officer 0
(CAO) 0
detected 0
allegedly 0
falsified 0
purchase 0
orders, 0
and 0
the 0
Inspector 0
General 0
quickly 0
expanded 0
the 0
scope 0
to 0
investigate 0
cyber 0

finding 0
that 0
members 0
of 0
the 0

improperly 0
accessed 0
congressmen’s 0
servers 0
and 0
the 0
House 0

Though 0

suspected 0
that 0

the 0

learned, 0

did 0
not 0
ban 0
them 0
from 0
the 0

until 0
nearly 0
a 0
year 0
later. 0

In 0
the 0
meantime, 0
evidence 0
appears 0
to 0
have 0
been 0
compromised: 0
In 0
December 0
2016, 0
the 0
CAO 0
notified 0
congressmen 0
that 0
the 0
caucus 0
server 0
had 0
physically 0
disappeared. 0

Though 0
Abid 0
played 0
a 0
prominent 0
role 0
in 0
the 0
late-2016 0
IG 0
report, 0
he 0
has 0
not 0
been 0
arrested, 0
with 0
congressmen 0
saying 0
a 0
criminal 0
investigation 0
is 0
ongoing. 0

In 0
January 0
2017, 0
in 0
the 0
days 0
around 0
his 0
father’s 0
death, 0
Abid 0
removed 0
Gilani 0
as 0
the 0
beneficiary 0
of 0
his 0
father’s 0
life 0
insurance 0
and 0
replaced 0
her 0
with 0
himself, 0
which 0
led 0
to 0
a 0
lawsuit, 0
TheDCNF 0
previously 0
reported. 0

Abid’s 0
attorney, 0
Jim 0
Bacon, 0
used 0
the 0
life 0
insurance 0
lawsuit 0
to 0
force 0
Gilani 0
to 0
sit 0
for 0
a 0
sworn 0
deposition 0
Oct. 0
4, 0
2017 0
in 0
which 0
he 0
told 0
her 0
to 0
reveal 0
what 0
she 0
told 0
the 0
FBI 0
about 0
the 0
congressional 0
criminal 0
probe 0
and 0
tried 0
to 0
get 0
her 0
to 0
find 0
out 0
details 0
from 0
investigators. 0

In 0
one 0
exchange, 0
Bacon 0
knew 0
that 0
she 0
had 0
emailed 0
with 0

A: 0
