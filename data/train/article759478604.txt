of 0
“Cor 0

the 1

Today 0
I 0
received 0
an 0
email 0
from 0
a 0
monastery 0
of 0
cloistered 0
Carmelite 0
nuns 0
about 0
the 0
new 0
document 0
from 0
the 0
Vatican’s 0
Congregation 0
for 0
Religious. 0

They’re 0
helping 0
me 0
examine 0
this 0
document, 0
having 0
kindly 0
volunteered 0
to 0
serve 0
as 0
consultants, 0
to 0
help 0
me 0
understand 0
it 0
from 0
an 0
inside 0
position. 0

These, 0
I 0
might 0
add, 0
are 0
not 0
what 0
we 0
would 0
consider 0
a 0
“traditionalist” 0
community. 0

They 0
have 0
only 0
the 0
Novus 0
Ordo 0
Mass 0
and 0
use 0
the 0
new 0
rite 0
Divine 0
Office 0
in 0
their 0
native 0
vernacular 0
language. 0

For 0
obvious 0
reasons 0
I 0
can’t 0
identify 0
them, 0
even 0
to 0
say 0
what 0
country 0
they 0
are 0
in. 0

Writing 0
to 0
me 0
in 0
English, 0
by 0
way 0
of 0
introductory 0
comments 0
in 0
their 0
longer 0
analysis 0
of 0
the 0
document 0
that 0
will 0
be 0
forthcoming, 0
Sister 0
T, 0
fully 0
professed 0
and 0
a 0
senior 0
member 0
of 0
the 0
monastery’s 0
council, 0
said, 0
“The 0
Cor 0
Orans 0
document 0
is 0
the 0
death-knell 1
of 0
Carmel. 0

It 0
signals 0
the 0
end 0
of 0
the 0
contemplative 0
monastic 0
life. 0

Not 0
only 0
does 0
it 0
destroy 1
the 0
autonomy 0
of 0
the 0
Monasteries, 0
something 0
Our 0
Holy 0
Mother 0
St. 0
Teresa 0
was 0
extremely 0
insistent 0
about, 0
but 0
it 0
also 0
removes 0
the 0
Superior, 0
dissolves 0
her 0
authority 0
and 0
power, 0
removes 0
the 0
financial 0
independence 0
of 0
each 0
Monastery, 0
and 0
destroys 0
the 0
specificity 0
of 0
each 0
charism. 0

“This 0
is 0
a 0
disaster. 1

Especially 0
for 0
Carmel.” 0

I 0
contrast 0
this 0
frightening 1
comment 0
with 0
those 0
coming 0
from 0
the 0
man 0
immediately 0
responsible 0
for 0
“Cor 0
orans,” 0
Cardinal 0
João 0
Braz 0
de 0
Aviz, 0
the 0
Brazilian 0
prefect 0
of 0
the 0
Congregation 0
for 0
Institutes 0
of 0
Consecrated 0
Life 0
and 0
Societies 0
of 0
Apostolic 0
Life 0
in 0
a 0
speech 0
to 0
religious 0
formation 0
directors 0
in 0
2015, 0
in 0
which 0
he 0
laid 0
out 0
pretty 0
clearly 0
what 0
was 0
coming 0
in 0
this 0
piece 0
of 0
legislation, 0
3 0
years 0
later. 0

In 0
fact, 0
as 0
the 0
National 0
Catholic 0
Reporter 0
piece 0
said, 0
the 0
meeting 0
itself 0
was 0
“unprecedented,” 0
1200 0
formators 0
of 0
religious 0
life 0
gathered 0
by 0
the 0
Congregation 0
for 0
Religious 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
hear 0
the 0
new 0
marching 0
orders. 0

This 0
is 0
the 0
programme: 0

“Do 0
not 0
distance 0
yourself 0
from 0
the 0
great 0
lines 0
of 0
the 0
Second 0
Vatican 0
Council.” 0
“In 0
fact, 0
those 1
that 1
are 1
distancing 1
themselves 1
from 1
the 1
council 1
to 1
make 1
another 1
path 1
are 1
killing 1
themselves 1
– 0
sooner 1
or 1
later, 1
they 1
will 1
die. 1

They 0
will 0
not 0
have 0
sense. 0

They 1
will 1
be 1
outside 1
the 1
church. 1

We 0
need 0
to 0
build, 0
using 0
the 0
Gospel 0
and 0
the 0
Council 0
as 0
a 0
departure 0
point.” 0

After 0
breathing 0
this 0
threat, 0
the 0
cardinal 0
continued, 0
saying 0
that 0
because 0
modern 0
people’s 0
“needs” 0
are 0
fundamentally 0
different 0
from 0
what 0
they 0
were 0
in 0
the 0
past, 0
there 0
was 0
no 0
reason 0
to 0
stick 0
too 0
closely 0
to 0
what 0
the 0
founders 0
and 0
foundresses 0
– 0
people 0
like 0
St. 0
Anthony, 0
St. 0
Augustine, 0
St. 0
John 0
Cassian, 0
St. 0
Benedict, 0
St. 0
Bruno, 0
St. 0
Dominic, 0
Sts. 0

Francis 0
and 0
Clare, 0
Sts. 0

Teresa 0
of 0
Avila 0
and 0
John 0
of 0
the 0
Cross 0
- 0
wanted. 0

“These 0
contexts 0
have 0
changed. 0

And 0
the 0
council 0
reminds 0
us 0
that 0
consecrated 0
life 0
must 0
be 0
Christian 0
discipleship 0
... 0
must 0
be 0
discipleship 0
of 0
the 0
founders 0
that 0
we 0
remember, 0
but 0
also 0
must 0
be 0
open 0
to 0
the 0
culture 0
of 0
the 0
present 0
moment.” 0

“We 0
must 0
not 0
be 0
closed 0
to 0
new 0
things. 0

God 0
is 0
not 0
static,” 0
the 0
cardinal 0
said. 0

“God 0
is 0
always 0
new 0
movement 0
– 0
of 0
light, 0
of 0
heat, 0
of 0
demonstration. 0

He 0
speaks 0
in 0
every 0
time 0
to 0
men 0
and 0
women 0
with 0
the 0
true 0
language 0
of 0
that 0
time.” 0

The 0
congregation’s 0
Secretary, 0
Archbishop 0
José 0
Rodríguez 0
Carballo, 0
is 0
reported 0
as 0
saying, 0
“With 0
this 0
explicit 0
reference 0
to 0
the 0
Second 0
Vatican 0
Council, 0
we 0
point 0
to 0
our 0
profound 0
conviction 0
that 0
the 0
council 0
is 0
the 0
point 0
of 0
reference, 0
non-negotiable, 0
in 0
the 0
formation 0
to 0
the 0
consecrated 0
life.” 0

Not 0
the 0
charism 0
of 0
the 0
order, 0
nor 0
the 0
rule, 0
nor 0
the 0
Patristic 0
tradition, 0
nor 0
the 0
Doctors, 0
nor 0
the 0
mystics, 0
nor 0
any 0
of 0
the 0
2000-year-old 0
tradition 0
of 0
religious 0
life, 0
from 0
the 0
Desert 0
Fathers 0
to 0
the 0
giants 0
of 0
the 0
Tridentine 0
period; 0
just 0
Vatican 0
II. 0

And 0
only, 0
apparently, 0
a 0
single 0
“interpretation” 0
of 0
it, 0
if 0
we 0
are 0
to 0
judge 0
by 0
the 0
soap 0
and 0
oil 0
Braz 0
de 0
Aviz 0
poured 0
on 0
the 0
ruffled 0
feathers 0
of 0
the 0
Leadership 0
Conference 0
of 0
Women 0
Religious 0
– 0
the 1
most 1
virulently 1
anti-Catholic 1
organisation 1
of 1
“Catholic” 1
religious 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
– 0
and 0
by 0
his 0
vicious 0
persecution 0
of 0
the 0
Franciscans 0
of 0
the 0
Immaculate. 0

Carballo 0
continues 0
his 0
remarks, 0
giving 0
us 0
a 0
clue 0
as 0
to 0
his 0
feelings 0
towards 0
strictly 0
cloistered, 0
contemplative 0
religious 0
life: 0
“A 0
consecrated 0
life, 0
a 0
life 0
in 0
God 0
but 0
inserted 0
in 0
the 0
ecclesial 0
family, 0
in 0
the 0
church 0
– 0
inserted 0
in 0
the 0
world. 0

Not 0
in 0
conflict 0
with 0
the 0
world, 0
but 0
inserted 0
in 0
continuity,” 0
he 0
said. 0

It 0
is 0
to 0
wonder 0
what 0
this 0
man 0
would 0
make 0
of 0
a 0
comment 0
by 0
the 0
great 0
Dom 0
Paul 0
Delatte, 0
the 0
second 0
abbot 0
of 0
Solesmes 0
and 0
successor 0
to 0
the 0
refounder, 0
Dom 0
Gueranger, 0
who 0
wrote 0
in 0
his 0
commentary 0
on 0
the 0
Rule 0
of 0
St. 0
Benedict: 0

“The 0
Prologue 0
set 0
this 0
choice 0
before 0
us, 0
the 0
world 0
or 0
Our 0
Lord, 0
as 0
mutually 1
exclusive 1
alternatives; 1
we 0
cannot 0
remain 0
neutral, 0
but 0
must 0
belong 0
wholly 0
to 0
the 0
one 0
or 0
wholly 0
to 0
the 0
other.” 0

“After 0
entering 0
into 0
Christ 0
by 0
baptism 0
and 0
by 0
the 0
monastic 0
profession, 0
we 0
should 0
hold 0
ourselves 0
as 0
far 0
aloof 0
from 0
the 0
world 0
as 0
possible 0
and 0
have 0
no 0
connection 0
with 0
it. 0

There 0
shall 0
no 0
longer 0
be 0
more 0
intercourse 0
between 0
us 0
than 0
there 0
is 0
between 0
two 0
corpses: 0
‘The 0
world 0
is 0
crucified 0
to 0
me 0
and 0
I 0
to 0
the 0
world.’ 0

“Let 0
us 0
be 0
on 0
our 0
guard 0
against 0
thinking 0
that 0
it 0
may 0
sometimes 0
be 0
proper 0
to 0
soften 0
the 0
differences, 0
to 0
lessen 0
the 0
distance 0
which 0
separates 0
us. 0

The 0
Apostle 0
warns 0
us 0
that 0
we 0
can 0
only 0
please 0
God 0
by 0
preserving 0
the 0
integrity 0
of 0
our 0
true 0
life: 0
‘No 0
man 0
being 0
a 0
soldier 0
to 0
God, 0
entangleth 0
himself 0
with 0
secular 0
businesses: 0
that 0
he 0
may 0
please 0
him 0
to 0
whom 0
he 0
hath 0
engaged 0
himself.’ 0
The 0
world 0
itself 0
is 0
scandalised 0
by 0
our 0
condescending 0
to 0
it, 0
and 0
the 0
words 0
of 0
the 0
Imitation 0
[of 0
Christ] 0
are 0
always 0
fulfilled: 0
‘Sometimes 0
we 0
think 0
to 0
please 0
others 0
by 0
our 0
company; 0
whereas 0
we 0
begin 0
rather 0
to 0
be 0
displeasing 0
to 0
them 0
by 0
reason 0
of 0
the 0
bad 0
qualities 0
they 0
discover 0
in 0
us.’” 0

How 0
Cor 0
orans 0
will 0
end 0
St. 0
Teresa 0
of 0
Avila’s 0
reform 0
of 0
Carmel 0

Sister 0
T. 0
continued, 0
saying 0
that 0
the 0
document 0
explicitly 0
derogates 0
the 0
founding 0
intentions 0
of 0
St. 0
Teresa 0
for 0
whom 0
real 0
autonomy 0
was 0
a 0
crucial 0
element 0
of 0
her 0
Carmelite 0
reform. 0

She 0
acknowledges 0
that 0
cloistered 0
orders 0
of 0
nuns 0
have 0
for 0
some 0
time 0
been 0
gathered 0
into 0
federations. 0

These 0
are 0
already 0
doing 0
the 0
Cor 0
orans 0
programme, 0
having 0
shared 0
initial 0
formation 0
programmes 0
for 0
postulants 0
and 0
novices, 0
“ongoing 0
formation” 0
courses 0
for 0
professed 0
nuns, 0
a 0
federal 0
abbess 0
or 0
president 0
who 0
oversees 0
all 0
the 0
federated 0
monasteries. 0

Their 0
funds 0
are 0
already 0
interconnected 0
and 0
they 0
have 0
regular 0
meetings 0
with 0
and 0
input 0
from 0
the 0
male 0
branches. 0

In 0
2015, 0
Carmelite 0
monasteries 0
received 0
a 0
questionnaire 0
from 0
the 0
Father 0
General 0
Fr. 0

Saverio 0
Cannistra, 0
a 0
Mexican 0
and 0
devotee 0
of 0
Liberation 0
Theology, 0
to 0
ask 0
if 0
they 0
wanted 0
an 0
International 0
Commission 0
of 0
Nuns 0
to 0
oversee 0
the 0
female 0
houses 0
place 0
of 0
the 0
Carmelite 0
Fathers. 0

This 0
suggestion 0
was 0
rejected, 0
to 0
the 0
annoyance 0
of 0
Maccise. 0

Maccise 0
also 0
promoted 0
the 0
idea 0
of 0
having 0
no 0
superiors 0
in 0
the 0
individual 0
monasteries, 0
but 0
only 0
federation 0
presidents 0
and 0
shared 0
formation 0
of 0
novices. 0

The 0
push 0
for 0
these 0
changes 0
is 0
still 0
on, 0
however, 0
under 0
the 0
current 0
General, 0
an 0
Italian, 0
Saverio 0
Cannistrà. 0

Given 0
the 0
Marxist 0
leanings 0
of 0
the 0
recent 0
crop 0
of 0
Fathers 0
General, 0
it 0
seems 0
clear 0
that 0
what 0
can 0
be 0
expected 0
by 0
“ongoing 0
formation” 0
is, 0
in 0
essence, 0
some 0
form 0
of 0
political 0
indoctrination, 0
sprayed 0
over 0
with 0
a 0
micro-thin 0
layer 0
of 0
pious 0
language. 0

But 0
for 0
Carmelite 0
nuns, 0
Sister 0
said, 0
these 0
ideas 0
are 0
the 0
antithesis 0
of 0
the 0
intentions 0
of 0
St. 0
Teresa. 0

Authentic 0
autonomy, 0
independence 0
of 0
formation 0
and 0
finances, 0
“are 0
essential 0
points 0
of 0
our 0
charism 0
that 0
Our 0
Holy 0
Mother 0
established 0
and 0
to 0
do 0
away 0
with 0
them 0
is 0
to 0
do 0
away 0
with 0
the 0
charism.” 0

“They 0
go 0
against 0
our 0
Constitutions, 0
even 0
though 0
Cor 0
Orans 0
states 0
that 0
everything 0
is 0
to 0
be 0
done 0
in 0
accord 0
with 0
the 0
charism 0
and 0
Constitutions. 0

Each 0
Carmel 0
has 0
its 0
own 0
spirit, 0
its 0
own 0
tempo, 0
it’s 0
own 0
‘feel.’ 0
Each 0
nun 0
is 0
called 0
not 0
just 0
to 0
the 0
Order, 0
but 0
to 0
a 0
specific 0
Carmel. 0

Formation 0
in 0
common 0
is 0
something 0
we’ve 0
been 0
fighting 0
against 0
for 0
years.” 0

“To 0
have 0
a 0
federal 0
president 0
who 0
can 0
decide 0
to 0
take 0
the 0
novices 0
away, 0
or 0
take 0
all 0
our 0
finances, 0
or 0
tell 0
the 0
Holy 0
See 0
we’re 0
no 0
longer 0
‘viable’ 0
– 0
this 0
is 0
a 0
disaster. 1

St. 0
Teresa 0
specifically 0
set 0
up 0
the 0
monasteries 0
so 0
that 0
none 0
of 0
this 0
would 0
take 0
place. 0

And 0
now 0
it’s 0
going 0
to 0
be 0
done 0
to 0
us.” 0

She 0
points 0
to 0
the 0
extended 0
length 0
of 0
formation 0
for 0
new 0
nuns 0
- 0
previously 0
six 0
years 0
for 0
Carmelites 0
and 0
under 0
Cor 0
orans 0
now 0
nine 0
years, 0
as 0
absurd, 1
saying 0
it 0
will 0
tend 0
to 0
impede 0
new 0
vocations. 0

“As 0
though 0
the 0
Church 0
is 0
going 0
to 0
ask 0
laypeople 0
to 0
be 0
engaged 0
for 0
nine 0
years 0
before 0
they 0
marry. 0

Our 0
Constitutions 0
already 0
provide 0
a 0
three 0
year 0
extension 0
of 0
temporary 0
vows 0
if 0
needed, 0
but 0
to 0
make 0
it 0
mandatory 0
will 0
dissuade 0
women 0
from 0
entering. 0

It 0
will 0
also 0
help 0
the 0
monastery 0
become 0
‘less 0
viable’ 0
because 0
by 0
the 0
time 0
anyone 0
younger 0
is 0
professed, 0
the 0
others 0
will 0
be 0
dead.” 0

Another 0
requirement 0
will 0
be 0
for 0
a 0
“religious 0
assistant,” 0
a 0
priest 0
monitoring 0
the 0
monastery 0
in 0
addition 0
to 0
a 0
chaplain, 0
to 0
be 0
assigned 0
by 0
the 0
federation. 0

Sister 0
writes 0
that 0

“One 0

that 0
they 0

mean 0
by 0
“ongoing 0
formation”. 0

Judging 0
from 0
other 0
documents 0
from 0
already-federated 0
Carmelites 0
in 0
Europe, 0
it 0
means 0
in 0
practical 0
terms 0
going 0
in 0
groups 0
away 0
from 0
the 0
monastery 0
for 0
days 0
or 0

The 0
content 0
of 0
these 0

of 0

to 0
be 0
formulated 0

Federation. 0

Sister 0
writes, 0
“Cloistered 0
nuns 0
have 0
a 0
very 0
full 0
horarium 0
that 0
does 0
not 0
allow 0
for 0
a 0
lot 0
of 0
other 0
things. 0

We 0
already 0
have 0
to 0
deal 0
with 0
the 0
million 1
unexpected 0
things 0
that 0
come 0
up 0
each 0
day. 0

I 0
have 0
no 0
idea 0
how 0
we 0
are 0
going 0
to 0
implement 0
all 0
these 0
ridiculous 1
plans 0
of 0
‘on-going 0
formation’. 0

Can 0
they 0
not 0
comprehend 0
that 0
simply 0
faithfully 0
living 0
our 0
daily 0
life 0
provides 0
plenty 0
of 0
on-going 0
formation.” 0

Apparently 0
not. 0

As 0
I 0
wrote 0
in 0
my 0
first 0
analysis 0
piece, 0
the 0
document 0
itself 0
– 0
that 0
we 0
must 0
remember 0
is 0
a 0
piece 0
of 0
legislation, 0
a 0
legal 0
document 0
laying 0
out 0
what 0
all 0
monasteries 0
of 0
contemplative 0
nuns 0
must 0
now 0
do 0
– 0
starts 0
by 0
laying 0
out 0
its 0
working 0
premise: 0

Pope 0
Francis, 0
in 0
the 0
wake 0
of 0
the 0
teaching 0
of 0
Pope 0
Pius 0
XII 0
and 0
reaffirmed 0
by 0
Ecumenical 0
Vatican 0
Council 0
II, 0
intended 0
to 0
present 0
in 0
Vultum 0
Dei 0
quaerere 0
the 0
intense 0
and 0
fruitful 0
path 0
taken 0
by 0
the 0
Church 0
in 0
the 0
last 0
decades, 0
in 0
the 0
light 0
of 0
the 0
teachings 0
of 0
the 0
same 0
Council 0
and 0
considering 0
the 0
changed 0
socio-cultural 0
conditions. 0

In 0
other 0
words, 0
it 0
is 0
the 0
“intense 1
and 1
fruitful 1
path” 1
of 0
the 0
last 0
few 0
decades 0
of 0
the 0
Church 0
since 0
Vatican 0
II 0
that 0
all 0
monasteries 0
of 0
cloistered, 0
contemplative 0
nuns 0
must 0
now 0
take. 0

Anyone 0
who 0
imagines 0
that 0
this 0
document’s 0
authors 0
will 0
allow 0
leeway, 0
that 0
there 0
will 0
be 0
dispensations 0
forthcoming 0
for 0
traditional 0
or 0
“conservative” 0
communities 0
from 0
timid 0
and 0
cowed 0
Vatican 0
bodies 0
like 0
Ecclesia 0
Dei, 0
has 0
failed 0
to 0
pay 0
attention. 0

In 0
the 0
last 0
20 0
years, 0
“conservative” 0
Catholics 0
have 0
pointed 0
to 0
the 0
flourishing 0
– 0
mainly 0
in 0
the 0
US 0
– 0
of 0
some 0
groups 0
of 0
sisters 0
who 0
had 0
turned 0
away 0
from 0
the 0
“intense 1
and 1
fruitful 1
path” 1
and 0
re-established 0
some 0
of 0
the 0
traditional 0
accoutrements 0
of 0
the 0
religious 0
life. 0

They 0
point 0
to 0
the 0
Nashville 0
Dominicans, 0
the 0
Missionaries 0
of 0
Charity, 0
the 0
Poor 0
Clares 0
of 0
Alabama, 0
where 0
there 0
are 0
at 0
least 0
habits, 0
(some) 0
chant, 0
common 0
life 0
and 0
common 0
apostolates. 0

But 0
it 0
is 0
these 0
signs 0
of 0
refusal 0
of 0
the 0
programme 0
that 0
have 0
infuriated 0
the 0
despots 1
of 0
the 0
New 0
Paradigm 0
who 0
would 1
not 1
rest 1
until 1
every 0
last 0
individual 0
house 0
of 0
religious 0
life 0
was 0
co-opted, 0
subverted 0
to 0
the 0
new 0
ideology. 0

The 0
little 0
green 0
shoots 0
of 0
hope 0
that 0
the 0
faithful 0
Catholic 0
world 0
so 0
rejoiced 0
to 0
see 0
are 0
to 0
be 0
stamped 0
back 0
into 0
the 1
frost 1
of 1
Vatican 1
II’s 1
perpetual 1
winter. 1

In 0
the 0
continuing 0
analysis 0
that 0
will 0
follow 0
this 0
article, 0
we 0
can 0
see 0
that 0
the 0
purpose 0
of 0
this 0
document 0
is 0
to 0
fulfill 0
the 0
totalitarian 0
fantasies 0
of 0
the 0
anti-Catholic 0
revolutionaries, 0
now 0
nearing 0
the 0
end 0
of 0
their 0
lives 0
50 0
years 0
after 0
their 0
initial 0
near-triumph. 0

Its 0
intention 0
is 0
mopping 0
up; 0
either 0
to 0
herd 0
the 0
remaining 0
recalcitrants 0
– 0
those 0
who 0
have 0
resisted 0
even 0
to 0
the 0
softened 0
and 0
conciliating 0
degrees 0
typical 0
of 0
“conservatives” 0
– 0
into 0
the 0
full 0
post-conciliar 0
“reform” 0
instituted 0
by 0
the 0
revolutionaries 0
in 0
the 0
1960s 0
– 0
or 0
to 0
close 0
them. 0

The 0
thing 0
is, 0
the 0
result 0
will 0
obviously 0
be 0
the 0
same 0
either 0
way. 0

The 0
whole 0
world 0
has 0
seen 0
what 0
happens 0
to 0
religious 0
life 0
that 0
takes 0
on 0
the 0
VaticanTwoist 0
New 0
Paradigm. 0

I 0
have 0
just 0
received 0

The 0

I’ll 0
be 0
analysing 0
this 0
document 0
in 0
some 0

in 0
the 0

the 0
rest 0
of 0
the 0
responses 0
to 0
the 0
Father 0
General’s 0
questionnaire 0
tell 0
a 0
similar 0
story. 0

The 0
German 0
federation 0
gave 0
a 0
summary 0
of 0
the 0
efforts 0
made 0
to 0
address 0
these 0

This 0
is 0
the 0
death 1
spiral. 1

And 0
it 0
is 0
precisely 0
this 0
“intense 1
and 1
fruitful 1
path” 1
taken 0
by 0
nearly 0
all 0
the 0
Catholic 0

1965 0
