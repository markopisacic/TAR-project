received 0 41 5
an 0 41 5

from 0 41 5
a 0 41 5

about 0 41 5
the 0 41 5
new 0 41 5
document 0 41 5
from 0 41 5
the 0 41 5
Vatican’s 0 41 5
Congregation 0 41 5
for 0 41 5
Religious. 0 41 5

They’re 0 41 6
helping 0 41 6
me 0 41 6
examine 0 41 6
this 0 41 6
document, 0 41 6
having 0 41 6
kindly 0 41 6

consultants, 0 41 6
to 0 41 6

me 0 41 6
understand 0 41 6
it 0 41 6
from 0 41 6
an 0 41 6
inside 0 41 6
position. 0 41 6

These, 0 41 7
I 0 41 7
might 0 41 7
add, 0 41 7
are 0 41 7
not 0 41 7
what 0 41 7
we 0 41 7
would 0 41 7
consider 0 41 7
a 0 41 7
“traditionalist” 0 41 7
community. 0 41 7

independence 0 41 12
of 0 41 12
each 0 41 12

destroys 0 41 12
the 0 41 12

laid 0 41 15
out 0 41 15
pretty 0 41 15
clearly 0 41 15
what 0 41 15
was 0 41 15
coming 0 41 15

this 0 41 15
piece 0 41 15
of 0 41 15
legislation, 0 41 15
3 0 41 15
years 0 41 15

fact, 0 41 16

the 0 41 16
National 0 41 16

the 0 41 16

the 0 41 16
new 0 41 16
marching 0 41 16
orders. 0 41 16

This 0 41 17
is 0 41 17
the 0 41 17
programme: 0 41 17

“Do 0 41 18
not 0 41 18
distance 0 41 18
yourself 0 41 18
from 0 41 18
the 0 41 18
great 0 41 18
lines 0 41 18
of 0 41 18

“In 0 41 18

those 1 41 18

themselves 1 41 18

sooner 1 41 18
or 1 41 18
later, 1 41 18
they 1 41 18
will 1 41 18
die. 1 41 18

They 0 41 19
will 0 41 19
not 0 41 19
have 0 41 19
sense. 0 41 19

breathing 0 41 22
this 0 41 22
threat, 0 41 22
the 0 41 22
cardinal 0 41 22

fundamentally 0 41 22
different 0 41 22
from 0 41 22
what 0 41 22

were 0 41 22
in 0 41 22
the 0 41 22

Carballo 0 41 34
continues 0 41 34
his 0 41 34
remarks, 0 41 34
giving 0 41 34
us 0 41 34
a 0 41 34
clue 0 41 34
as 0 41 34
to 0 41 34
his 0 41 34
feelings 0 41 34
towards 0 41 34
strictly 0 41 34
cloistered, 0 41 34
contemplative 0 41 34
religious 0 41 34
life: 0 41 34
“A 0 41 34
consecrated 0 41 34
life, 0 41 34
a 0 41 34
life 0 41 34
in 0 41 34
God 0 41 34
but 0 41 34
inserted 0 41 34
in 0 41 34

he 0 41 35
said. 0 41 35

It 0 41 36
is 0 41 36
to 0 41 36
wonder 0 41 36
what 0 41 36
this 0 41 36
man 0 41 36
would 0 41 36
make 0 41 36
of 0 41 36
a 0 41 36
comment 0 41 36
by 0 41 36
the 0 41 36
great 0 41 36

to 0 41 36
the 0 41 36
refounder, 0 41 36
Dom 0 41 36
Gueranger, 0 41 36

wrote 0 41 36

“The 0 41 37

we 0 41 37
cannot 0 41 37
remain 0 41 37
neutral, 0 41 37

must 0 41 37

wholly 0 41 37
to 0 41 37

“After 0 41 38
entering 0 41 38
into 0 41 38
Christ 0 41 38
by 0 41 38
baptism 0 41 38
and 0 41 38
by 0 41 38
the 0 41 38
monastic 0 41 38
profession, 0 41 38
we 0 41 38
should 0 41 38
hold 0 41 38
ourselves 0 41 38

have 0 41 38
no 0 41 38

There 0 41 39

I 0 41 39
to 0 41 39

“Let 0 41 40

The 0 41 41

itself 0 41 41
is 0 41 41
scandalised 0 41 41
by 0 41 41

How 0 41 42

will 0 41 42
end 0 41 42
St. 0 41 42
Teresa 0 41 42
of 0 41 42
Avila’s 0 41 42
reform 0 41 42
of 0 41 42
Carmel 0 41 42

Sister 0 41 43
T. 0 41 43
continued, 0 41 43
saying 0 41 43
that 0 41 43
the 0 41 43
document 0 41 43
explicitly 0 41 43
derogates 0 41 43
the 0 41 43
founding 0 41 43
intentions 0 41 43
of 0 41 43
St. 0 41 43
Teresa 0 41 43
for 0 41 43
whom 0 41 43
real 0 41 43
autonomy 0 41 43
was 0 41 43
a 0 41 43
crucial 0 41 43
element 0 41 43
of 0 41 43
her 0 41 43
Carmelite 0 41 43
reform. 0 41 43

She 0 41 44
acknowledges 0 41 44
that 0 41 44
cloistered 0 41 44
orders 0 41 44
of 0 41 44
nuns 0 41 44
have 0 41 44
for 0 41 44
some 0 41 44
time 0 41 44
been 0 41 44
gathered 0 41 44
into 0 41 44
federations. 0 41 44

These 0 41 45
are 0 41 45
already 0 41 45
doing 0 41 45
the 0 41 45
Cor 0 41 45
orans 0 41 45
programme, 0 41 45
having 0 41 45
shared 0 41 45
initial 0 41 45
formation 0 41 45
programmes 0 41 45
for 0 41 45
postulants 0 41 45
and 0 41 45
novices, 0 41 45
“ongoing 0 41 45
formation” 0 41 45
courses 0 41 45
for 0 41 45
professed 0 41 45
nuns, 0 41 45
a 0 41 45
federal 0 41 45
abbess 0 41 45
or 0 41 45
president 0 41 45
who 0 41 45
oversees 0 41 45
all 0 41 45
the 0 41 45
federated 0 41 45
monasteries. 0 41 45

Their 0 41 46
funds 0 41 46
are 0 41 46
already 0 41 46
interconnected 0 41 46
and 0 41 46
they 0 41 46
have 0 41 46
regular 0 41 46
meetings 0 41 46
with 0 41 46
and 0 41 46
input 0 41 46
from 0 41 46
the 0 41 46
male 0 41 46
branches. 0 41 46

In 0 41 47
2015, 0 41 47
Carmelite 0 41 47
monasteries 0 41 47
received 0 41 47
a 0 41 47
questionnaire 0 41 47
from 0 41 47
the 0 41 47
Father 0 41 47
General 0 41 47
Fr. 0 41 47

Saverio 0 41 48
Cannistra, 0 41 48
a 0 41 48
Mexican 0 41 48
and 0 41 48
devotee 0 41 48
of 0 41 48
Liberation 0 41 48
Theology, 0 41 48
to 0 41 48
ask 0 41 48
if 0 41 48
they 0 41 48
wanted 0 41 48
an 0 41 48
International 0 41 48
Commission 0 41 48
of 0 41 48
Nuns 0 41 48
to 0 41 48
oversee 0 41 48
the 0 41 48
female 0 41 48
houses 0 41 48
place 0 41 48
of 0 41 48
the 0 41 48
Carmelite 0 41 48
Fathers. 0 41 48

This 0 41 49
suggestion 0 41 49
was 0 41 49
rejected, 0 41 49
to 0 41 49
the 0 41 49
annoyance 0 41 49
of 0 41 49
Maccise. 0 41 49

Maccise 0 41 50
also 0 41 50
promoted 0 41 50
the 0 41 50
idea 0 41 50
of 0 41 50
having 0 41 50
no 0 41 50
superiors 0 41 50
in 0 41 50
the 0 41 50
individual 0 41 50
monasteries, 0 41 50
but 0 41 50
only 0 41 50
federation 0 41 50
presidents 0 41 50
and 0 41 50
shared 0 41 50
formation 0 41 50
of 0 41 50
novices. 0 41 50

The 0 41 51
push 0 41 51
for 0 41 51
these 0 41 51
changes 0 41 51
is 0 41 51
still 0 41 51
on, 0 41 51
however, 0 41 51
under 0 41 51
the 0 41 51
current 0 41 51
General, 0 41 51
an 0 41 51
Italian, 0 41 51
Saverio 0 41 51
Cannistrà. 0 41 51

Given 0 41 52
the 0 41 52
Marxist 0 41 52
leanings 0 41 52
of 0 41 52
the 0 41 52
recent 0 41 52
crop 0 41 52
of 0 41 52
Fathers 0 41 52
General, 0 41 52
it 0 41 52
seems 0 41 52
clear 0 41 52
that 0 41 52
what 0 41 52
can 0 41 52
be 0 41 52
expected 0 41 52
by 0 41 52
“ongoing 0 41 52
formation” 0 41 52
is, 0 41 52
in 0 41 52
essence, 0 41 52
some 0 41 52
form 0 41 52
of 0 41 52
political 0 41 52
indoctrination, 0 41 52
sprayed 0 41 52
over 0 41 52
with 0 41 52
a 0 41 52
micro-thin 0 41 52
layer 0 41 52
of 0 41 52
pious 0 41 52
language. 0 41 52

But 0 41 53
for 0 41 53
Carmelite 0 41 53
nuns, 0 41 53
Sister 0 41 53
said, 0 41 53
these 0 41 53
ideas 0 41 53
are 0 41 53
the 0 41 53
antithesis 0 41 53
of 0 41 53
the 0 41 53
intentions 0 41 53
of 0 41 53
St. 0 41 53
Teresa. 0 41 53

Authentic 0 41 54
autonomy, 0 41 54
independence 0 41 54
of 0 41 54
formation 0 41 54
and 0 41 54
finances, 0 41 54
“are 0 41 54
essential 0 41 54
points 0 41 54
of 0 41 54
our 0 41 54
charism 0 41 54
that 0 41 54
Our 0 41 54
Holy 0 41 54
Mother 0 41 54
established 0 41 54
and 0 41 54
to 0 41 54
do 0 41 54
away 0 41 54
with 0 41 54
them 0 41 54
is 0 41 54
to 0 41 54
do 0 41 54
away 0 41 54
with 0 41 54
the 0 41 54
charism.” 0 41 54

“They 0 41 55
go 0 41 55
against 0 41 55
our 0 41 55
Constitutions, 0 41 55
even 0 41 55
though 0 41 55
Cor 0 41 55
Orans 0 41 55
states 0 41 55
that 0 41 55
everything 0 41 55
is 0 41 55
to 0 41 55
be 0 41 55
done 0 41 55
in 0 41 55
accord 0 41 55
with 0 41 55
the 0 41 55
charism 0 41 55
and 0 41 55
Constitutions. 0 41 55

Each 0 41 56
Carmel 0 41 56
has 0 41 56
its 0 41 56
own 0 41 56
spirit, 0 41 56
its 0 41 56
own 0 41 56
tempo, 0 41 56
it’s 0 41 56
own 0 41 56
‘feel.’ 0 41 56
Each 0 41 56
nun 0 41 56
is 0 41 56
called 0 41 56
not 0 41 56
just 0 41 56
to 0 41 56
the 0 41 56
Order, 0 41 56
but 0 41 56
to 0 41 56
a 0 41 56
specific 0 41 56
Carmel. 0 41 56

Formation 0 41 57
in 0 41 57
common 0 41 57
is 0 41 57
something 0 41 57
we’ve 0 41 57
been 0 41 57
fighting 0 41 57
against 0 41 57
for 0 41 57
years.” 0 41 57

“To 0 41 58
have 0 41 58
a 0 41 58
federal 0 41 58
president 0 41 58
who 0 41 58
can 0 41 58
decide 0 41 58
to 0 41 58
take 0 41 58
the 0 41 58
novices 0 41 58
away, 0 41 58

all 0 41 58

‘viable’ 0 41 58
– 0 41 58
this 0 41 58
is 0 41 58
a 0 41 58
disaster. 1 41 58

St. 0 41 59
Teresa 0 41 59
specifically 0 41 59
set 0 41 59
up 0 41 59
the 0 41 59
monasteries 0 41 59
so 0 41 59
that 0 41 59
none 0 41 59
of 0 41 59
this 0 41 59
would 0 41 59
take 0 41 59

And 0 41 60
now 0 41 60
it’s 0 41 60
going 0 41 60
to 0 41 60
be 0 41 60
done 0 41 60
to 0 41 60

She 0 41 61
points 0 41 61
to 0 41 61
the 0 41 61
extended 0 41 61
length 0 41 61
of 0 41 61

for 0 41 61

- 0 41 61
previously 0 41 61
six 0 41 61

now 0 41 61
nine 0 41 61
