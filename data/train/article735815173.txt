“I 0 77 13

that 0 77 13
was 0 77 13
what 0 77 13
they 0 77 13
wanted 0 77 13
to 0 77 13
write. 0 77 13

Nah, 0 77 14
I 0 77 14
don’t 0 77 14
have 0 77 14
no 0 77 14
problems 0 77 14
with 0 77 14

don’t 0 77 14
spend 0 77 14
a 0 77 14
whole 0 77 14
lot 0 77 14
of 0 77 14
my 0 77 14
time 0 77 14
dealing 0 77 14
with 0 77 14
those 0 77 14
kind 0 77 14
of 0 77 14
things,” 0 77 14
Davis 0 77 14
said. 0 77 14

“That’s 0 77 15
just 0 77 15
one 0 77 15
segment 0 77 15
of 0 77 15
what 0 77 15
goes 0 77 15
on 0 77 15
in 0 77 15
our 0 77 15
world. 0 77 15

The 1 77 16
world 1 77 16
is 1 77 16
so 1 77 16
much 1 77 16
bigger 1 77 16
than 1 77 16
Farrakhan 1 77 16
and 1 77 16
the 1 77 16
Jewish 1 77 16
question 1 77 16
and 1 77 16
his 1 77 16
position 1 77 16
on 1 77 16
that 1 77 16
and 1 77 16
so 1 77 16
forth. 1 77 16

For 0 77 17
those 0 77 17
heavy 0 77 17
into 0 77 17
it, 0 77 17
that’s 0 77 17
their 0 77 17
thing, 0 77 17
but 0 77 17
it 0 77 17
ain’t 0 77 17
my 0 77 17
thing,” 0 77 17
he 0 77 17
said 0 77 17

The 1 77 18
people 1 77 18
who 1 77 18
talk 1 77 18
about 1 77 18
the 1 77 18
"Jewish 1 77 18
question" 1 77 18
are 1 77 18
generally 1 77 18
anti-Semites. 1 77 18

Somehow 0 77 19
I 0 77 19
don't 0 77 19
think 0 77 19
a 0 77 19
white 0 77 19
congressman 0 77 19
would 0 77 19
get 0 77 19
away 0 77 19
with 0 77 19
saying 0 77 19
that 0 77 19
he 0 77 19
agrees 0 77 19
with 0 77 19
David 0 77 19
Duke 0 77 19
on 0 77 19
the 0 77 19
environment 0 77 19
but 0 77 19
isn't 0 77 19
especially 0 77 19
concerned 0 77 19
about 0 77 19
his 0 77 19
racism. 0 77 19

But 0 77 20
black 0 77 20
leaders 0 77 20
have 0 77 20
gotten 0 77 20
away 0 77 20
with 0 77 20
playing 0 77 20
that 0 77 20
game 0 77 20
with 0 77 20
Farrakhan 0 77 20
repeatedly. 0 77 20

But 0 77 21
the 0 77 21
ADL 0 77 21
and 0 77 21
the 0 77 21
JTA 0 77 21
will 0 77 21
whitewash 1 77 21
this 0 77 21
again. 0 77 21

And 1 77 22
if 1 77 22
they 1 77 22
can't 1 77 22
whitewash 1 77 22
this, 1 77 22
they'll 1 77 22
ignore 1 77 22
it. 1 77 22
