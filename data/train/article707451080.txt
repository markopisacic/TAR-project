Did 0
you 0
know 0
that 0
the 0
House 0
of 0
Representatives 0
has 0
paid 0
out 0
$15,000,000 0
to 0
victims 0
of 0
sexual 0
harassment 0
in 0
recent 0
years? 0

I 0
am 0
going 0
to 0
share 0
some 0
things 0
with 0
you 0
in 0
this 0
article 0
that 0
are 0
deeply 1
disturbing, 1
but 0
it 0
is 0
for 0
a 0
purpose. 0

The 0
status 0
quo 0
is 0
not 0
acceptable 0
in 0
Washington, 0
and 1
once 1
people 1
truly 1
understand 1
how 1
deep 1
the 1
corruaption 1
runs 1
I 1
believe 1
that 1
they 1
will 1
get 1
motivated 1
to 1
finally 1
drain 1
the 1
swamp 1
once 1
and 1
for 1
all. 1

So 0
yes, 0
I 0
am 0
going 0
to 0
share 0
some 0
things 0
in 0
this 0
article 0
that 0
are 0
truly 1
disgusting, 1
but 0
the 0
goal 0
is 0
to 0
show 0
you 0
that 0
it 1
is 1
time 1
to 1
take 1
our 1
government 1
back 1
from 1
the 1
corrupt 1
career 1
politicians 1
that 1
are 1
completely 1
and 1
utterly 1
out 1
of 1
control. 1

In 0
recent 0
days, 0
CNN 0
has 0
interviewed 0
dozens 0
of 0
people 0
that 0
worked 0
on 0
Capitol 0
Hill, 0
and 0
almost 0
every 0
single 0
one 0
of 0
them 0
had 0
stories 0
of 0
sexual 0
harassment 0
to 0
share… 0

CNN 0
spoke 0
with 0
more 0
than 0
50 0
lawmakers, 0
current 0
and 0
former 0
Hill 0
aides 0
and 0
political 0
veterans 0
who 0
have 0
worked 0
in 0
Congress, 0
the 0
majority 0
of 0
whom 0
spoke 0
anonymously 0
to 0
be 0
candid 0
and 0
avoid 0
potential 0
repercussions. 0

With 0
few 0
exceptions, 0
every 0
person 0
said 0
they 0
have 0
personally 0
experienced 0
sexual 0
harassment 0
on 0
the 0
Hill 0
or 0
know 0
of 0
others 0
who 0
have. 0

In 0
an 0
environment 0
with 0
“so 0
many 0
young 0
women,” 0
said 0
one 0
ex-House 0
aide, 0
the 1
men 1
“have 1
no 1
self-control.” 1
“Amongst 0
ourselves, 0
we 0
know,” 0
a 0
former 0
Senate 0
staffer 0
said 0
of 0
the 0
lawmakers 0
with 0
the 0
worst 0
reputations. 0

And 0
sometimes, 0
the 0
sexual 0
advances 0
from 0
members 0
of 0
Congress 0
or 0
senior 0
aides 0
are 0
reciprocated 0
in 0
the 0
hopes 0
of 0
advancing 0
one’s 0
career 0
— 0
what 0
one 0
political 0
veteran 0
bluntly 0
referred 0
to 0
as 0
a 0
“sex 1
trade 1
on 1
Capitol 1
Hill.” 1

The 1
American 1
people 1
are 1
not 1
going 1
to 1
put 1
up 1
with 1
this 1
any 1
longer. 1

We 1
have 1
no 1
choice 1
but 1
to 1
clean 1
up 1
our 1
government 1
because 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
is 1
laughing 1
at 1
us. 1

On 0
Tuesday, 0
U.S. 0
Representative 0
Jackie 0
Speier 0
told 0
a 0
congressional 0
hearing 0
that 0
she 0
personally 0
knows 0
of 0
two 0
current 0
members 0
of 0
Congress 0
that 0
have 0
“engaged 0
in 0
sexual 0
harassment”… 0

“In 0
fact 0
there 0
are 0
two 0
members 0
of 0
Congress, 0
Republican 0
and 0
Democrat, 0
right 0
now, 0
who 0
serve 0
— 0
who 0
have…engaged 0
in 0
sexual 0
harassment.” 0
Speier 0
said 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
harassers 0
has 0
propositioned 0
women 0
with 0
the 0
comment, 0
“Are 1
you 1
going 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
good 1
girl?” 1
Another 0
has 1
exposed 1
his 1
genitals, 1
she 0
said, 0
and 0
some 0
victims 0
have 0
had 0
“their 1
private 1
parts 1
grabbed 1
on 1
the 1
House 1
floor.” 1
“All 0
they 0
ask 0
in 0
return 0
as 0
staff 0
members 0
is 0
to 0
be 0
able 0
to 0
work 0
in 0
a 0
hostile-free 0
work 0
environment. 0

They 0
want 0
the 0
system 0
fixed 0
and 0
the 0
perpetrators 0
held 0
accountable.” 0

And 0
Speier 0
was 0
the 0
one 0
that 0
revealed 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
15 0
million 0
dollars 0
have 0
been 0
paid 0
out 0
to 0
victims 0
of 0
sexual 0
harassment 0
in 0
the 0
House 0
in 0
recent 0
years. 0

The 0
following 0
comes 0
from 0
Breitbart… 0

Rep. 0
Jackie 0
Speier 0
(D-CA) 0
told 0
MSNBC’s 0
Chuck 0
Todd 0
on 0
Meet 0
the 0
Press 0
Daily 0
on 0
Tuesday 0
that 0
the 0
U.S. 0
House 0
of 0
Representatives 0
has 0
paid 0
$15 0
million 0
to 0
alleged 0
victims 0
of 0
sexual 0
harassment 0
by 0
its 0
own 0
members 0
in 0
recent 0
years. 0

“We 0
do 0
know 0
there 0
is 0
about 0
$15 0
million 0
that 0
has 0
been 0
paid 0
out 0
by 0
the 0
House 0
on 0
behalf 0
of 0
harassers 0
in 0
the 0
last 0
ten 0
to 0
15 0
years,” 0
she 0
said. 0

“15 0
million 0
dollars 0
has 0
been 0
paid 0
out 0
over 0
sexual 0
harassment 0
claims,” 0
Todd 0
replied, 0
somewhat 0
shocked. 0

“So, 0
obviously 0
more 0
than 0
one 0
member 0
of 0
Congress.” 0

If 0
members 0
of 0
Congress 0
are 0
engaged 0
in 0
this 0
type 0
of 0
behavior, 0
why 0
don’t 0
the 0
American 0
people 0
know 0
about 0
it? 0

And 0
why 0
are 0
those 0
members 0
of 0
Congress 0
still 0
allowed 0
to 0
serve? 0

Representative 0
Barbara 0
Comstock 0
also 0
testified 0
on 0
Tuesday. 0

She 0
said 0
that 0
one 0
current 0
member 0
of 0
Congress 0
exposed 1
his 1
private 1
parts 1
to 1
a 1
female 1
staffer 1
when 0
she 0
delivered 0
papers 0
to 0
his 0
house… 0

Rep. 0
Barbara 0
Comstock 0
(R-Va.) 0
said 0
at 0
a 0
House 0
Administration 0
Committee 0
hearing 0
on 0
Tuesday 0
that 0
a 0
sitting 0
member 0
of 0
the 0
U.S. 0
Congress 0
exposed 0
himself 0
to 0
a 0
young 0
female 0
staffer 0
who 0
delivered 0
papers 0
to 0
his 0
house–at 0
his 0
request. 0

We 0
need 0
to 0
be 0
told 0
who 0
this 0
member 0
of 0
Congress 0
is 0
so 0
that 0
he 0
can 0
be 0
removed 0
from 0
Congress 0
immediately. 0

This 0
kind 0
of 0
behavior 0
is 0
not 0
acceptable 0
for 0
anyone 0
in 0
a 0
civilized 0
society 0
– 0
and 1
that 1
goes 1
double 1
for 1
someone 1
that 1
is 1
supposed 1
to 1
be 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
leaders 1
of 1
our 1
nation. 1

Here 0
are 0
the 0
exact 0
words 0
that 0
Comstock 0
used 0
as 0
she 0
described 0
this 0
incident… 0

This 0
member 0
asked 0
a 0
staffer 0
to 0
bring 0
them 0
over 0
some 0
materials, 0
to 0
their 0
residence. 0

And 0
the 0
young 0
staffer 0
— 0
it 0
was 0
a 0
young 0
woman 0
— 0
went 0
there 0
and 0
was 0
greeted 0
with 0
a 0
member 0
in 0
a 0
towel. 0

It 0
was 0
a 0
male, 0
who 0
then 0
invited 0
her 0
in. 0

And 0
at 0
that 0
point, 0
he 0
decided 0
to 0
expose 0
himself. 0

She 0
left, 0
and 0
then 0
she 0
quit 0
her 0
job. 0

She 1
left, 1
she 1
found 1
another 1
job. 1

Of 0
course, 0
this 0
sort 0
of 0
behavior 0
is 0
not 0
just 0
limited 0
to 0
members 0
of 0
Congress. 0

According 0
to 0
an 0
ex-Secret 0
Service 0
agent, 0
Vice-President 0
Joe 0
Biden 0
was 0
regularly 0
engaged 0
in 0
“Weinstein-level” 1
predatory 1
behavior… 1

An 0
ex-Secret 0
Service 0
agent 0
is 0
claiming 0
that 0
former 0
Vice 0
President 0
Joe 0
Biden 0
engaged 0
in 0
“Weinstein-level” 1
sexual 1
assault 1
and 0
that 0
he 0
would 0
walk 0
around 0
the 0
VP 0
residence 0
late 0
at 0
night 0
completely 1
naked. 1

According 0
to 0
Big 0
League 0
Politics’ 0
Cassandra 0
Fairbanks, 0
a 0
Secret 0
Service 0
agent 0
who 0
spoke 0
on 0
condition 0
of 0
anonymity 0
revealed 0
that 0
Biden 0
“would 1
mess 1
with 1
every 1
single 1
woman 1
or 1
teen,” 1
and 0
that 0
a 0
Christmas 0
get-together 0
at 0
the 0
VP’s 0
house 0
had 0
to 0
be 0
canceled 0
“because 0
Biden 0
would 1
grope 1
all 1
of 1
our 1
wives 1
and 1
girlfriend’s 1
asses.” 1

In 0
fact, 0
things 0
were 0
so 0
bad 0
that 0
at 0
one 0
point 0
a 0
Secret 0
Service 0
agent 0
almost 0
got 0
into 0
a 0
fight 0
with 0
Biden. 0

Here 0
is 0
more 0
from 0
Paul 0
Joseph 0
Watson… 0

During 0
one 0
alleged 0
incident 0
in 0
2009, 0
Biden 0
cupped 0
the 0
breast 0
of 0
a 0
Secret 0
Service 0
agent’s 0
girlfriend 0
during 0
a 0
photo, 0
prompting 0
the 0
agent 0
to 0
shove 0
Biden 0
and 0
almost 0
hit 0
him. 0

The 0
agent 0
was 0
subsequently 0
suspended 0
for 0
a 0
week, 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
source. 0

Men 0
would 0
often 0
stand 0
in 0
front 0
of 0
female 0
agents 0
and 0
Navy 0
women 0
or 0
create 0
false 0
pretenses 0
to 0
have 0
them 0
leave 0
the 0
room 0
just 0
to 0
get 0
them 0
away 0
from 0
Biden, 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
agent. 0

When 0
I 0
am 0
elected 0
to 0
Congress, 0
I 0
am 0
going 0
to 0
make 0
fighting 0
this 0
sort 0
of 0
predatory 0
behavior 0
a 0
top 0
priority. 0

We 1
are 1
supposed 1
to 1
serve 1
as 1
an 1
example 1
to 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
the 1
world, 1
and 1
instead, 1
we 1
have 1
become 1
a 1
bad 1
joke. 1

Those 1
that 1
have 1
been 1
engaging 1
in 1
this 1
sort 1
of 1
shameful 1
behavior 1
have 1
got 1
to 1
go 1
because 1
we 1
simply 1
are 1
not 1
going 1
to 1
put 1
up 1
with 1
it 1
anymore. 1
