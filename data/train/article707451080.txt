Did 0 172 1
you 0 172 1
know 0 172 1
that 0 172 1
the 0 172 1
House 0 172 1

in 0 172 1
recent 0 172 1
years? 0 172 1

I 0 172 2
am 0 172 2
going 0 172 2
to 0 172 2
share 0 172 2
some 0 172 2
things 0 172 2
with 0 172 2
you 0 172 2
in 0 172 2
this 0 172 2
article 0 172 2
that 0 172 2
are 0 172 2
deeply 1 172 2
disturbing, 1 172 2
but 0 172 2
it 0 172 2
is 0 172 2
for 0 172 2
a 0 172 2
purpose. 0 172 2

The 0 172 3
status 0 172 3
quo 0 172 3
is 0 172 3
not 0 172 3
acceptable 0 172 3
in 0 172 3
Washington, 0 172 3
and 1 172 3
once 1 172 3
people 1 172 3
truly 1 172 3
understand 1 172 3
how 1 172 3
deep 1 172 3
the 1 172 3
corruaption 1 172 3
runs 1 172 3
I 1 172 3
believe 1 172 3
that 1 172 3
they 1 172 3
will 1 172 3
get 1 172 3
motivated 1 172 3
to 1 172 3
finally 1 172 3
drain 1 172 3
the 1 172 3
swamp 1 172 3
once 1 172 3
and 1 172 3
for 1 172 3
all. 1 172 3

So 0 172 4
yes, 0 172 4
I 0 172 4
am 0 172 4
going 0 172 4
to 0 172 4
share 0 172 4
some 0 172 4
things 0 172 4
in 0 172 4
this 0 172 4
article 0 172 4
that 0 172 4
are 0 172 4
truly 1 172 4
disgusting, 1 172 4
but 0 172 4
the 0 172 4
goal 0 172 4
is 0 172 4
to 0 172 4
show 0 172 4
you 0 172 4
that 0 172 4
it 1 172 4
is 1 172 4
time 1 172 4
to 1 172 4
take 1 172 4
our 1 172 4
government 1 172 4
back 1 172 4
from 1 172 4
the 1 172 4
corrupt 1 172 4
career 1 172 4
politicians 1 172 4
that 1 172 4
are 1 172 4
completely 1 172 4
and 1 172 4
utterly 1 172 4
out 1 172 4
of 1 172 4
control. 1 172 4

In 0 172 5
recent 0 172 5
days, 0 172 5
CNN 0 172 5
has 0 172 5
interviewed 0 172 5
dozens 0 172 5
of 0 172 5
people 0 172 5
that 0 172 5
worked 0 172 5
on 0 172 5
Capitol 0 172 5
Hill, 0 172 5
and 0 172 5
almost 0 172 5
every 0 172 5
single 0 172 5
one 0 172 5
of 0 172 5
them 0 172 5
had 0 172 5
stories 0 172 5
of 0 172 5
sexual 0 172 5
harassment 0 172 5
to 0 172 5
share… 0 172 5

CNN 0 172 6
spoke 0 172 6
with 0 172 6
more 0 172 6
than 0 172 6
50 0 172 6
lawmakers, 0 172 6
current 0 172 6
and 0 172 6
former 0 172 6
Hill 0 172 6
aides 0 172 6
and 0 172 6
political 0 172 6
veterans 0 172 6
who 0 172 6
have 0 172 6
worked 0 172 6
in 0 172 6
Congress, 0 172 6
the 0 172 6
majority 0 172 6
of 0 172 6
whom 0 172 6
spoke 0 172 6
anonymously 0 172 6
to 0 172 6
be 0 172 6
candid 0 172 6
and 0 172 6
avoid 0 172 6
potential 0 172 6
repercussions. 0 172 6

With 0 172 7
few 0 172 7
exceptions, 0 172 7
every 0 172 7
person 0 172 7
said 0 172 7
they 0 172 7
have 0 172 7
personally 0 172 7
experienced 0 172 7
sexual 0 172 7
harassment 0 172 7
on 0 172 7
the 0 172 7
Hill 0 172 7
or 0 172 7
know 0 172 7
of 0 172 7
others 0 172 7
who 0 172 7
have. 0 172 7

In 0 172 8
an 0 172 8
environment 0 172 8
with 0 172 8
“so 0 172 8
many 0 172 8
young 0 172 8
women,” 0 172 8
said 0 172 8
one 0 172 8
ex-House 0 172 8
aide, 0 172 8
the 1 172 8
men 1 172 8
“have 1 172 8
no 1 172 8
self-control.” 1 172 8
“Amongst 0 172 8
ourselves, 0 172 8
we 0 172 8
know,” 0 172 8
a 0 172 8
former 0 172 8
Senate 0 172 8
staffer 0 172 8
said 0 172 8
of 0 172 8
the 0 172 8
lawmakers 0 172 8
with 0 172 8
the 0 172 8
worst 0 172 8
reputations. 0 172 8

And 0 172 9
sometimes, 0 172 9
the 0 172 9
sexual 0 172 9
advances 0 172 9
from 0 172 9
members 0 172 9
of 0 172 9
Congress 0 172 9
or 0 172 9
senior 0 172 9
aides 0 172 9
are 0 172 9
reciprocated 0 172 9
in 0 172 9
the 0 172 9
hopes 0 172 9
of 0 172 9
advancing 0 172 9
one’s 0 172 9
career 0 172 9
— 0 172 9
what 0 172 9
one 0 172 9
political 0 172 9
veteran 0 172 9
bluntly 0 172 9
referred 0 172 9
to 0 172 9
as 0 172 9
a 0 172 9
“sex 1 172 9
trade 1 172 9
on 1 172 9
Capitol 1 172 9
Hill.” 1 172 9

The 1 172 10
American 1 172 10
people 1 172 10
are 1 172 10
not 1 172 10
going 1 172 10
to 1 172 10
put 1 172 10
up 1 172 10
with 1 172 10
this 1 172 10
any 1 172 10
longer. 1 172 10

We 1 172 11
have 1 172 11
no 1 172 11
choice 1 172 11
but 1 172 11
to 1 172 11
clean 1 172 11
up 1 172 11
our 1 172 11
government 1 172 11
because 1 172 11
the 1 172 11
rest 1 172 11
of 1 172 11
the 1 172 11
world 1 172 11
is 1 172 11
laughing 1 172 11
at 1 172 11
us. 1 172 11

On 0 172 12
Tuesday, 0 172 12
U.S. 0 172 12
Representative 0 172 12
Jackie 0 172 12
Speier 0 172 12
told 0 172 12
a 0 172 12
congressional 0 172 12
hearing 0 172 12
that 0 172 12
she 0 172 12
personally 0 172 12
knows 0 172 12
of 0 172 12
two 0 172 12
current 0 172 12

that 0 172 12
have 0 172 12
“engaged 0 172 12

“In 0 172 13

Speier 0 172 13
said 0 172 13
one 0 172 13
of 0 172 13
the 0 172 13
harassers 0 172 13
has 0 172 13
propositioned 0 172 13
women 0 172 13
with 0 172 13
the 0 172 13
comment, 0 172 13
“Are 1 172 13

Another 0 172 13
has 1 172 13
exposed 1 172 13
his 1 172 13
genitals, 1 172 13
she 0 172 13
said, 0 172 13
and 0 172 13
some 0 172 13
victims 0 172 13
have 0 172 13
had 0 172 13
“their 1 172 13

“All 0 172 13

They 0 172 14

And 0 172 15
Speier 0 172 15
was 0 172 15
the 0 172 15
one 0 172 15
that 0 172 15

somewhat 0 172 19

this 0 172 35

When 0 172 44
I 0 172 44
am 0 172 44
elected 0 172 44
to 0 172 44
Congress, 0 172 44

the 1 172 45

and 1 172 45
instead, 1 172 45
we 1 172 45
have 1 172 45
become 1 172 45
a 1 172 45
