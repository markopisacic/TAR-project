The 0
Last-Minute 0
Character 1
Assassination 1
of 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh 0

Using 0
any 0
despicable 1
tactic 1
at 0
hand 0
to 0
derail 0
Judge 0
Brett 0
Kavanaugh’s 0
Supreme 0
Court 0
confirmation 0
less 0
than 0
a 0
week 0
before 0
the 0
Senate 0
Judiciary 0
Committee 0
is 0
scheduled 0
to 0
vote 0
on 0
whether 0
to 0
approve 0
his 0
nomination, 0
Senate 0
Democrats 0
have 1
sunk 1
to 1
their 1
lowest 1
level 1
of 0
character 1
assassination 1
yet. 0

They 0
have 0
resorted 0
to 0
peddling 0
an 0
allegation 0
of 0
sexual 0
misconduct 0
against 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh 0
that 0
supposedly 0
occurred 0
while 0
the 0
judge 0
was 0
in 0
high 0
school. 0

The 0
accuser 0
had 0
refused 0
to 0
identify 0
herself 0
before 0
and 0
during 0
the 0
Senate 0
Judiciary 0
Committee 0
hearings. 0

She 0
conveniently 0
waited 0
until 0
this 0
Sunday 0
to 0
come 0
forward 0
via 0
an 0
on-the-record 0
interview 0
with 0
the 0
Washington 0
Post. 0

The 0
accuser’s 0
name 0
is 0
Christine 0
Blasey 0
Ford, 0
a 0
registered 0
Democrat 0
who 0
is 0
currently 0
a 0
California 0
professor 0
teaching 0
clinical 0
psychology. 0

Judge 0
Kavanaugh 0
issued 0
a 0
statement 0
on 0
Friday 0
in 0
which 0
he 0
said, 0
"I 0
categorically 1
and 1
unequivocally 1
deny 1
this 0
allegation. 0

I 0
did 0
not 0
do 0
this 0
back 0
in 0
high 0
school 0
or 0
at 0
any 0
time." 0

Senator 0
Dianne 0
Feinstein 0
(D-Calif.), 0
the 0
ranking 0
Democrat 0
on 0
the 0
Senate 0
Judiciary 0
Committee 0
that 0
heard 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh’s 0
public 0
testimony 0
earlier 0
this 0
month 0
during 0
his 0
Supreme 0
Court 0
confirmation 0
hearing, 0
had 0
received 0
last 0
July 0
a 0
copy 0
of 0
a 0
letter 0
written 0
by 0
the 0
woman 0
making 0
the 0
charge, 0
who 0
we 0
now 0
know 0
was 0
Ms. 0
Ford. 0

Even 0
though 0
Senator 0
Feinstein 0
had 0
the 0
letter 0
in 0
hand, 0
she 0
never 0
brought 0
up 0
the 0
charge 0
during 0
the 0
public 0
hearing, 0
nor 0
during 0
her 0
own 0
meeting 0
with 0
the 0
judge. 0

Instead, 0
Senator 0
Feinstein 0
sat 0
on 0
the 0
letter 0
until 0
late 0
last 0
week, 0
when 0
she 0
issued 0
a 0
cryptic 0
release 0
stating 0
that 0
she 0
had 0
received 0
the 0
letter 0
but 0
did 0
not 0
want 0
to 0
give 0
more 0
details 0
in 0
deference 0
to 0
the 0
woman’s 0
wish 0
to 0
keep 0
the 0
matter 0
confidential. 0

Senator 0
Feinstein 0
turned 0
the 0
letter 0
over 0
to 0
the 0
FBI. 0

The 0
FBI 0
placed 0
the 0
letter 0
in 0
its 0
background 0
file 0
on 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh 0
but 0
decided 0
not 0
to 0
pursue 0
any 0
further 0
investigation. 0

Senator 0
Feinstein 0
had 0
initially 0
resisted 0
sharing 0
the 0
contents 0
of 0
the 0
letter 0
with 0
her 0
fellow 0
Democrat 0
members 0
of 0
the 0
Senate 0
Judiciary 0
Committee 0
or 0
to 0
go 0
public 0
with 0
its 0
existence 0
because 0
“the 0
incident 0
was 0
too 0
distant 0
in 0
the 0
past 0
to 0
merit 0
public 0
discussion” 0
and 0
she 0
had 0
already 0
“taken 0
care 0
of 0
it,” 0
according 0
to 0
a 0
source 0
quoted 0
by 0
The 0
New 0
Yorker. 0

Nevertheless, 0
Senator 0
Feinstein 0
evidently 0
bowed 0
to 0
pressure 0
from 0
her 0
leftist 1
colleagues 1
to 0
find 0
a 0
way 0
to 0
insert 0
the 0
allegation 0
into 0
the 0
cesspool 1
of 1
public 1
gossip 1
at 0
the 0
eleventh 0
hour. 0

The 0
New 0
Yorker 0
article, 0
written 0
before 0
Ms. 0
Ford 0
publicly 0
identified 0
herself, 0
provided 0
some 0
details 0
regarding 0
her 0
allegation. 0

However, 0
now 0
Ms. 0
Ford 0
has 0
decided 0
to 0
do 0
what 0
she 0
called 0
her 0
“civic 0
responsibility” 0
and 0
tell 0
her 0
own 0
story 0
publicly. 0

How 1
convenient, 1
coming 0
just 0
4 0
days 0
before 0
the 0
scheduled 0
Senate 0
Judiciary 0
Committee 0
vote! 0

The 0
whole 0
sequence 0
of 0
events 0
surrounding 0
how 0
this 0
allegation 0
has 0
suddenly 0
come 0
to 0
light 0
reeks 1
of 0
a 0
set-up, 0
reminiscent 0
of 0
how 0
Anita 0
Hill 0
surfaced 0
in 0
a 0
last-minute 0
attempt 0
to 0
derail 0
Justice 0
Clarence 0
Thomas's 0
Supreme 0
Court 0
confirmation. 0

Christine 0
Blasey 0
Ford 0
claims, 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
Washington 0
Post 0
article, 0
that 0
“one 0
summer 0
in 0
the 0
early 0
1980s, 0
Kavanaugh 0
and 0
a 0
friend 0
— 0
both 0
‘stumbling 1
drunk,’ 1
Ford 0
alleges 0
— 0
corralled 0
her 0
into 0
a 0
bedroom 0
during 0
a 0
gathering 0
of 0
teenagers 0
at 0
a 0
house 0
in 0
Montgomery 0
County. 0

While 0
his 0
friend 0
watched, 0
she 0
said, 0
Kavanaugh 0
pinned 0
her 0
to 0
a 0
bed 0
on 0
her 0
back 0
and 0
groped 0
her 0
over 0
her 0
clothes, 0
grinding 0
his 0
body 0
against 0
hers 0
and 0
clumsily 0
attempting 0
to 0
pull 0
off 0
her 0
one-piece 0
bathing 0
suit 0
and 0
the 0
clothing 0
she 0
wore 0
over 0
it. 0

When 0
she 0
tried 0
to 0
scream, 0
she 0
said, 0
he 0
put 0
his 0
hand 0
over 0
her 0
mouth. 0

‘I 0
thought 0
he 0
might 0
inadvertently 0
kill 0
me,’ 0
said 0
Ford. 0

‘He 0
was 0
trying 0
to 0
attack 0
me 0
and 0
remove 0
my 0
clothing.’” 0
Ms. 0
Ford 0
said 0
she 0
was 0
able 0
to 0
escape 0
the 0
room 0
and 0
go 0
home 0
without 0
any 0
apparent 0
further 0
incident 0
after 0
“Kavanaugh’s 0
friend 0
and 0
classmate 0
at 0
Georgetown 0
Preparatory 0
School, 0
Mark 0
Judge, 0
jumped 0
on 0
top 0
of 0
them, 0
sending 0
all 0
three 0
tumbling.” 0

Here 0
is 0
where 0
Ms. 0
Ford’s 0
story 0
becomes 0
quite 0
murky 0
and 0
begins 0
to 0
fall 0
apart. 0

Although 0
Ms. 0
Ford 0
believes 0
the 0
alleged 0
incident 0
occurred 0
during 0
the 0
summer 0
of 0
1982, 0
she 0
“said 0
she 0
does 0
not 0
remember 0
some 0
key 0
details 0
of 0
the 0
incident,” 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
Washington 0
Post 0
article. 0

For 0
example, 0
Ms. 0
Ford 0
“said 0
she 0
does 0
not 0
remember 0
how 0
the 0
gathering 0
came 0
together 0
the 0
night 0
of 0
the 0
incident.” 0
She 0
also 0
does 0
not 0
remember 0
how 0
she 0
got 0
home. 0

Yet 0
she 0
claims 0
to 0
be 0
absolutely 0
certain 0
that 0
Kavanaugh, 0
whom 0
she 0
presumably 0
knew 0
only 0
as 0
an 0
acquaintance 0
and 0
said 0
she 0
had 0
not 0
spoken 0
to 0
since 0
the 0
night 0
the 0
incident 0
allegedly 0
occurred, 0
was 0
involved 0
in 0
the 0
alleged 0
incident. 0

Ms. 0
Ford 0
admitted 0
that 0
she 0
“told 0
no 0
one 0
at 0
the 0
time 0
what 0
had 0
happened 0
to 0
her.” 0
In 0
fact, 0
she 0
said 0
she 0
recalled 0
thinking: 0
“I’m 0
not 0
ever 0
telling 0
anyone 0
this. 0

This 0
is 0
nothing, 0
it 0
didn’t 0
happen, 0
and 0
he 0
didn’t 0
rape 0
me.” 0
Even 0
if 0
one 0
explains 0
this 0
behavior 0
as 0
the 0
natural 0
reaction 0
of 0
a 0
frightened 0
teenager 0
to 0
a 0
highly 0
traumatic 0
incident, 0
that 0
does 0
not 0
explain 0
why, 0
by 0
her 0
own 0
admission, 0
she 0
“told 0
no 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
incident 0
in 0
any 0
detail 0
until 0
2012, 0
when 0
she 0
was 0
in 0
couples 0
therapy 0
with 0
her 0
husband,” 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
Washington 0
Post 0
article. 0

Most 0
revealingly, 0
the 0
article 0
reported 0
on 0
a 0
gaping 1
hole 1
in 1
the 1
therapist’s 1
notes, 1
portions 0
of 0
which 0
were 0
provided 0
by 0
Ms. 0
Ford 0
for 0
the 0
Washington 0
Post’s 0
review. 0

The 0
therapist’s 0
notes 0
“do 0
not 0
mention 0
Kavanaugh’s 0
name 0
but 0
say 0
she 0
reported 0
that 0
she 0
was 0
attacked 0
by 0
students 0
‘from 0
an 0
elitist 1
boys’ 1
school’ 1
who 0
went 0
on 0
to 0
become 0
‘highly 0
respected 0
and 0
high-ranking 0
members 0
of 0
society 0
in 0
Washington.’” 0

In 0
other 0
words, 0
the 0
only 0
written 0
documentation 0
Ms. 0
Ford 0
has 0
offered 0
in 0
support 0
of 0
her 0
allegation 0
about 0
the 0
incident 0
she 0
said 0
took 0
place 0
while 0
she 0
was 0
in 0
high 0
school 0
– 0
a 0
therapist’s 0
notes 0
of 0
a 0
couples 0
therapy 0
session 0
occurring 0
30 0
years 0
after 0
the 0
alleged 0
incident 0
– 0
did 0
not 0
mention 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh’s 0
name. 0

Judge 0
Kavanaugh 0
has 0
had 0
extensive 0
background 0
checks 0
performed 0
on 0
him 0
in 0
the 0
past 0
for 0
his 0
various 0
federal 0
government 0
positions, 0
including 0
for 0
his 0
current 0
position 0
as 0
a 0
federal 0
appellate 0
court 0
judge, 0
without 0
the 0
accusation 0
ever 0
having 0
surfaced. 0

Ms. 1
Ford 1
may 1
believe 1
her 1
story 1
to 1
be 1
true, 1
but 1
the 1
lack 1
of 1
any 1
credible 1
corroborating 1
evidence, 1
her 1
partial 1
memory 1
of 1
details 1
surrounding 1
the 1
alleged 1
incident, 1
and 1
the 1
absence 1
of 1
any 1
pattern 1
of 1
such 1
sexual 1
misconduct 1
by 1
Judge 1
Kavanaugh 1
undercut 1
the 1
reliability 1
of 1
her 1
version 1
of 1
the 1
incident. 1

In 0
a 0
letter 0
addressed 0
to 0
Senate 0
Judiciary 0
Committee 0
Chairman 0
Charles 0
Grassley 0
(R-Iowa) 0
and 0
Senator 0
Feinstein, 0
65 0
women 0
who 0
said 0
they 0
knew 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh 0
in 0
high 0
school 0
vouched 0
for 0
his 0
character: 0

We 0
are 0
women 0
who 0
have 0
known 0
Brett 0
Kavanaugh 0
for 0
more 0
than 0
35 0
years 0
and 0
knew 0
him 0
while 0
he 0
attended 0
high 0
school 0
between 0
1979 0
and 0
1983. 0

For 1
the 1
entire 1
time 1
we 1
have 1
known 1
Brett 1
Kavanaugh, 1
he 1
has 1
behaved 1
honorably 1
and 1
treated 1
women 1
with 1
respect… 1
Brett 0
attended 0
Georgetown 0
Prep, 0
an 0
all-boys 0
high 0
school 0
in 0
Rockville, 0
Maryland. 0

He 0
was 0
an 0
outstanding 0
student 0
and 0
athlete 0
with 0
a 0
wide 0
circle 0
of 0
friends. 0

Almost 0
all 0
of 0
us 0
attended 0
all-girls 0
high 0
schools 0
in 0
the 0
area. 0

We 0
knew 0
Brett 0
well 0
through 0
social 0
events, 0
sports, 0
church, 0
and 0
various 0
other 0
activities. 0

Many 0
of 0
us 0
have 0
remained 0
close 0
friends 0
with 0
him 0
and 0
his 0
family 0
over 0
the 0
years. 0

Through 0
the 0
more 0
than 0
35 0
years 0
we 0
have 0
known 0
him, 0
Brett 0
has 0
stood 0
out 0
for 0
his 0
friendship, 0
character, 0
and 0
integrity. 0

In 0
particular, 0
he 0
has 0
always 0
treated 0
women 0
with 0
decency 0
and 0
respect. 0

That 0
was 0
true 0
when 0
he 0
was 0
in 0
high 0
school, 0
and 0
it 0
has 0
remained 0
true 0
to 0
this 0
day. 0

The 0
signers 0
of 0
this 0
letter 0
hold 0
a 0
broad 0
range 0
of 0
political 0
views. 0

Many 0
of 0
us 0
are 0
not 0
lawyers, 0
but 0
we 0
know 0
Brett 0
Kavanaugh 0
as 0
a 0
person. 0

And 0
he 0
has 0
always 0
been 0
a 0
good 0
person. 0

Nevertheless, 0
using 0
their 1
standard 1
contemptible, 1
obstructionist 1
tactics, 1
the 0
Democrats 0
opposed 0
to 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh 0
happily 0
seized 0
on 0
the 0
unsubstantiated 0
allegation 0
of 0
teen 0
sexual 0
misbehavior 0
in 0
high 0
school 0
to 0
assassinate 1
Judge 1
Kavanaugh’s 1
character. 1

They 0
have 0
done 0
so 0
in 0
the 0
face 0
of 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh’s 0
lifetime 0
record 0
of 0
stellar 0
public 0
service, 0
multiple 0
background 0
checks 0
producing 0
no 0
evidence 0
of 0
sexual 0
misconduct, 0
and 0
the 0
letter 0
written 0
by 0
the 0
65 0
women, 0
who 0
knew 0
him 0
when 0
he 0
was 0
in 0
high 0
school 0
and 0
thereafter 0
and 0
who 0
signed 0
their 0
names 0
to 0
a 0
ringing 0
endorsement 0
of 0
his 0
good 0
character. 0

Feminists 0
gave 1
the 1
serial 1
sexual 1
predator 1
Bill 1
Clinton 1
a 1
free 1
pass 1
because 1
his 1
policies 1
were 1
in 1
line 1
with 1
their 1
ideology. 1

Senator 0
Feinstein 0
called 0
Ted 1
“Chappaquiddick” 1
Kennedy 1
an 0
"inspiration 0
and 0
a 0
friend," 0
presumably 0
also 0
based 0
on 0
their 0
compatible 0
ideologies. 0

Hypocritically 0
exploiting 0
an 0
unsubstantiated 0
allegation 0
of 0
decades-old 0
purported 0
teenage 0
sexual 0
mischief, 0
Democrats 0
seeking 1
to 1
torpedo 1
Judge 0
Kavanaugh’s 0
Supreme 0
Court 0
confirmation 0
for 0
ideological 0
reasons 0
have 0
debased 0
themselves 0
with 0
a 0
shameless 1
smear 1
campaign 1
against 0
an 0
eminently 0
qualified 0
candidate 0
for 0
the 0
Supreme 0
Court. 0

Predictably, 0
Senate 0
Minority 0
Leader 0
Charles 0
Schumer 0
(D-N.Y.) 0
and 0
other 0
Democrats, 0
including 0
Senator 0
Feinstein, 0
have 0
called 0
for 0
the 0
Senate 0
to 0
postpone 0
a 0
vote 0
on 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh. 0

"Senator 0
Grassley 0
must 0
postpone 0
the 0
vote 0
until, 0
at 0
a 0
very 0
minimum, 0
these 0
serious 0
and 0
credible 0
allegations 0
are 0
thoroughly 0
investigated,” 0
Senator 0
Schumer 0
said. 0

If 0
a 0
thorough 0
investigation 0
was 0
considered 0
to 0
be 0
so 0
important, 0
why 1
didn't 1
Senator 1
Feinstein 1
set 1
the 1
ball 1
rolling 1
back 1
in 1
July 1
when 1
she 1
first 1
received 1
word 1
of 1
the 1
allegation? 1

The 0
answer 0
is 0
that 0
this 1
is 1
all 1
a 1
ruse 1
to 1
block 1
Judge 1
Kavanaugh's 1
confirmation 1
by 1
all 1
means 1
necessary. 1

Senator 0
Schumer 0
is 0
fulfilling 0
his 0
promise 0
to 0
oppose 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh 0
with 0
"everything 0
I've 0
got." 0

As 0
of 0
now, 0
the 0
Senate 0
Judiciary 0
Committee 0
Republican 0
majority 0
plans 0
to 0
move 0
forward 0
with 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh's 0
nomination 0
as 0
scheduled. 0

It 0
is 0
time 0
for 0
the 0
Democrat 0
obstructionists 0
to 0
slink 1
back 1
