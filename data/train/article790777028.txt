already 0 379 18

of 0 379 18

Two 0 379 19
of 0 379 19

Kavanaugh 0 379 20

said 0 379 21
attorney 0 379 21
Eric 0 379 21
B. 0 379 21
Bruce. 0 379 21

Kavanaugh 0 379 22
also 0 379 22
said 0 379 22
he 0 379 22
would 0 379 22
be 0 379 22
cooperating 0 379 22
as 0 379 22
he 0 379 22
has 0 379 22
in 0 379 22
the 0 379 22
past. 0 379 22

“Throughout 0 379 23
this 0 379 23
process, 0 379 23
I’ve 0 379 23
been 0 379 23
interviewed 0 379 23
by 0 379 23
the 0 379 23
FBI, 0 379 23
I’ve 0 379 23
done 0 379 23
a 0 379 23
number 0 379 23
of 0 379 23
‘background’ 0 379 23
calls 0 379 23
directly 0 379 23
with 0 379 23
the 0 379 23
Senate, 0 379 23
and 0 379 23
yesterday, 0 379 23
I 0 379 23
answered 0 379 23
questions 0 379 23
under 0 379 23
oath 0 379 23
about 0 379 23
every 0 379 23
topic 0 379 23
the 0 379 23
Senators 0 379 23
and 0 379 23
their 0 379 23
counsel 0 379 23
asked 0 379 23
me," 0 379 23
Kavanaugh 0 379 23
said 0 379 23
in 0 379 23
a 0 379 23
statement 0 379 23
that 0 379 23
was 0 379 23
released 0 379 23
by 0 379 23
the 0 379 23
White 0 379 23
House. 0 379 23

"I’ve 0 379 24
done 0 379 24
everything 0 379 24
they 0 379 24
have 0 379 24
requested 0 379 24
and 0 379 24
will 0 379 24
continue 0 379 24
to 0 379 24
cooperate." 0 379 24

Well, 0 379 25
Senator 0 379 25
Flake 0 379 25
has 0 379 25
given 0 379 25
the 0 379 25
Democrats 0 379 25
what 0 379 25
they 0 379 25
wanted 0 379 25
and 0 379 25
you 0 379 25
can 0 379 25
bet 0 379 25
that 0 379 25
they 0 379 25
are 0 379 25
still 0 379 25
going 0 379 25
to 0 379 25
vote 0 379 25
pretty 0 379 25
much 0 379 25
on 0 379 25
party 0 379 25
lines 0 379 25
concerning 0 379 25
Kavanaugh. 0 379 25

Now, 0 379 26
President 0 379 26
Trump 0 379 26
has 0 379 26
gone 0 379 26
along 0 379 26
with 0 379 26
it. 0 379 26

My 0 379 27
guess 0 379 27
is 0 379 27
that 0 379 27
one 0 379 27
of 0 379 27
two 0 379 27
things 0 379 27
will 0 379 27
occur 0 379 27
with 0 379 27
the 0 379 27
FBI 0 379 27
investigation: 0 379 27
(1) 0 379 27
Absolutely 1 379 27
nothing 1 379 27
will 1 379 27
be 1 379 27
found, 1 379 27
and 0 379 27
this 0 379 27
will 0 379 27
have 0 379 27
been 0 379 27
a 0 379 27
huge 1 379 27
waste 1 379 27
of 1 379 27
time 1 379 27
or 0 379 27
(2) 0 379 27
look 0 379 27
for 0 379 27
this 0 379 27
thing 0 379 27
to 0 379 27
expand 0 379 27
and 0 379 27
the 0 379 27
need 0 379 27
will 0 379 27
arise 0 379 27
to 0 379 27
make 0 379 27
this 0 379 27
more 1 379 27
of 1 379 27
a 1 379 27
circus 1 379 27
than 1 379 27
it 1 379 27
already 1 379 27
is, 1 379 27
which 0 379 27
will 0 379 27
dwarf 0 379 27
anything 0 379 27
Clarence 0 379 27
Thomas 0 379 27
had 0 379 27
to 0 379 27
face 0 379 27
from 0 379 27
the 0 379 27
slanderous 1 379 27
accusations 0 379 27
of 0 379 27
Anita 0 379 27
Hill. 0 379 27

Remember, 0 379 27

whether 0 379 27

you 0 379 27

like 0 379 27

Judge 0 379 27

Kavanaugh 0 379 27

or 0 379 27

not, 0 379 27

this 0 379 27

has 0 379 27

been 0 379 27

nothing 0 379 27

but 0 379 27

a 0 379 27

political 1 379 27

hit. 1 379 27
