extra-marital 0 110 2

relations 0 110 2
so 0 110 2
long 0 110 2
as 0 110 2
they 0 110 2

an 0 110 2
ill-defined 0 110 2
“process 0 110 2
of 0 110 2

As 0 110 2
Father 0 110 2
Brian 0 110 2
Harrison 0 110 2
has 0 110 2
so 0 110 2
trenchantly 0 110 2
observed, 0 110 2
this 0 110 2
means 0 110 2
that 0 110 2
people 0 110 2
embroiled 0 110 2
in 0 110 2
adultery 0 110 2
can 0 110 2
receive 0 110 2
Holy 0 110 2
Communion 0 110 2
while 0 110 2
they 0 110 2
“discern” 0 110 2
that 0 110 2
they 0 110 2
should 0 110 2
not 0 110 2
be 0 110 2
receiving 0 110 2
Holy 0 110 2
Communion 0 110 2
because 0 110 2
they 0 110 2
are 0 110 2
embroiled 0 110 2
in 0 110 2
adultery. 0 110 2

Do 1 110 3
they 1 110 3
think 1 110 3
we 1 110 3
are 1 110 3
fools? 1 110 3

Then 0 110 4
there 0 110 4
is 0 110 4
the 0 110 4
endlessly 0 110 4
double-talking 0 110 4
Cardinal 0 110 4
Müller. 0 110 4

In 0 110 5
a 0 110 5
recent 0 110 5
interview 0 110 5
concerning 0 110 5
Rocco 0 110 5
Buttiglione’s 0 110 5
verbal 1 110 5
contortions 1 110 5
aimed 0 110 5
at 0 110 5
demonstrating 0 110 5
that 0 110 5
the 0 110 5
administration 0 110 5
of 0 110 5
Holy 0 110 5
Communion 0 110 5
to 0 110 5
public 0 110 5
adulterers 0 110 5
is 0 110 5
consistent 0 110 5
with 0 110 5
the 0 110 5
Church’s 0 110 5
bimillenial 0 110 5
prohibition 0 110 5
of 0 110 5
precisely 0 110 5
that, 0 110 5
Müller 0 110 5
proposed 0 110 5
this 0 110 5
preposterous 1 110 5
“solution” 1 110 5
to 0 110 5
a 0 110 5
“problem” 0 110 5
that 0 110 5
does 0 110 5
not 0 110 5
exist: 0 110 5

It 0 110 6
is 0 110 6
possible 0 110 6
that 0 110 6
the 0 110 6
penitent 0 110 6
may 0 110 6
be 0 110 6
convinced 0 110 6
in 0 110 6
conscience, 0 110 6
and 0 110 6
with 0 110 6
good 0 110 6
reasons, 0 110 6
of 0 110 6
the 0 110 6
invalidity 0 110 6
of 0 110 6
the 0 110 6
first 0 110 6
marriage 0 110 6
even 0 110 6
though 0 110 6
they 0 110 6
cannot 0 110 6
offer 0 110 6
canonical 0 110 6
proof. 0 110 6

In 0 110 7
this 0 110 7
case 0 110 7
the 0 110 7
marriage 0 110 7
valid 0 110 7
before 0 110 7
God 0 110 7
would 0 110 7
be 0 110 7
the 0 110 7
second 0 110 7
one 0 110 7
and 0 110 7
the 0 110 7
pastor 0 110 7
could 0 110 7
grant 0 110 7
the 0 110 7
sacrament, 0 110 7
certainly 0 110 7
with 0 110 7
the 0 110 7
appropriate 0 110 7
precautions 0 110 7
as 0 110 7
not 0 110 7
to 0 110 7
scandalize 0 110 7
the 0 110 7
community 0 110 7
of 0 110 7
the 0 110 7
faithful 0 110 7
and 0 110 7
not 0 110 7
to 0 110 7
weaken 0 110 7
the 0 110 7
conviction 0 110 7
of 0 110 7
marriage 0 110 7
indissolubility. 0 110 7

The 0 110 8
Cardinal 0 110 8
knows 0 110 8
this 0 110 8
is 0 110 8
moral 1 110 8
and 1 110 8
canonical 1 110 8
nonsense. 1 110 8

No 1 110 9
Catholic, 1 110 9
whether 1 110 9
or 1 110 9
not 1 110 9
he 1 110 9
consults 1 110 9
a 1 110 9
priest, 1 110 9
can 1 110 9
declare 1 110 9
for 1 110 9
himself 1 110 9
that 1 110 9
his 1 110 9
marriage 1 110 9
in 1 110 9
the 1 110 9
Church 1 110 9
was 1 110 9
invalid, 1 110 9
especially 1 110 9
when—indeed 1 110 9
because—he 1 110 9
lacks 1 110 9
canonical 1 110 9
proof 1 110 9
of 1 110 9
invalidity. 1 110 9

Moreover, 0 110 10
absent 0 110 10
an 0 110 10
annulment 0 110 10
granted 0 110 10
by 0 110 10
the 0 110 10
competent 0 110 10

tribunal, 0 110 10
a 0 110 10
purported 0 110 10
“second 0 110 10
marriage” 0 110 10
can 0 110 10
only 0 110 10
be 0 110 10
an 0 110 10
invalid 0 110 10
civil 0 110 10
ceremony 0 110 10
and 0 110 10
thus 0 110 10
a 0 110 10
thinly 0 110 10
disguised 0 110 10
form 0 110 10
of 0 110 10
continuous 0 110 10
public 0 110 10
adultery. 0 110 10

of 0 110 11
the 0 110 11
Church’s 0 110 11

The 0 110 16
only 0 110 16
case 0 110 16
in 0 110 16
which 0 110 16
a 0 110 16

could 0 110 16
admit 0 110 16
a 0 110 16
person 0 110 16

in 0 110 16

of 0 110 16
Penance 0 110 16
and 0 110 16
Holy 0 110 16

the 0 110 16

of 0 110 16
a 0 110 16
couple 0 110 16

live 0 110 16
“as 0 110 16

that 0 110 16

the 0 110 16

Even 0 110 17
then, 0 110 17
the 0 110 17

lest 0 110 17
other 0 110 17

Cardinal 0 110 18
Müller 0 110 18
think 0 110 18
we 0 110 18
are 0 110 18
fools? 0 110 18

Some 0 110 19
of 0 110 19
us 0 110 19
apparently 0 110 19
are, 0 110 19
or 0 110 19
at 0 110 19
least 0 110 19
are 0 110 19
willing 0 110 19
to 0 110 19

defending 0 110 19
neo-Pharisaical 0 110 19
sophistry 0 110 19
that 0 110 19
would 0 110 19
produce 0 110 19
“a 0 110 19

an 0 110 20

we 1 110 29
