Cardinal 0
Burke 0
to 0
Michael 0
Matt: 0
"Amoris 0
Not 0
An 0
Exercise 0
of 0
Magisterium" 0
(Now 0
what?) 0

Given 0
that 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
has, 0
since 0
that 0
interview 0
took 0
place, 0
attempted 0
to 0
make 0
the 0
Argentine 0
bishops’ 0
interpretation 0
of 0
AL 0
'magisterial'--an 0
interpretation 0
that 0
allows 0
public 0
adulterers 0
to 0
receive 0
Holy 0
Communion--Cardinal 0
Burke’s 0
reply 0
to 0
my 0
question 0
on 0
January 0
9th 0
of 0
this 0
year 0
would 0
seem 0
to 0
take 0
on 0
new 0
relevancy. 0

In 0
my 0
interview 0
of 0
Raymond 0
Cardinal 0
Burke 0
less 0
than 0
one 0
year 0
ago, 0
I 0
asked 0
His 0
Eminence 0
to 0
clarify 0
what, 0
exactly, 0
is 0
the 0
level 0
of 0
authoritative 0
weight 0
of 0
Pope 0
Francis’s 0
post-synodal 0
exhortation, 0
Amoris 0
Laetitia. 0

Now, 0
Cardinal 0
Francesco 0
Coccopalmerio, 0
president 0
of 0
the 0
Pontifical 0
Council 0
for 0
Legislative 0
Texts, 0
made 0
it 0
very 0
clear 0
to 0
the 0
Catholic 0
News 0
Service 0
on 0
December 0
5 0
what 0
the 0
Pope 0
is 0
up 0
to: 0
“The 0
fact 0
that 0
the 0
pope 0
requested 0
that 0
his 0
letter 0
and 0
the 0
interpretations 0
of 0
the 0
Buenos 0
Aires 0
bishops 0
be 0
published 0
in 0
the 0
AAS 0
means 0
that 0
His 0
Holiness 0
has 0
given 0
these 0
documents 0
a 0
particular 0
qualification 0
that 0
elevates 0
them 0
to 0
the 0
level 0
of 0
being 0
official 0
teachings 0
of 0
the 0
church. 0

While 0
the 0
content 0
of 0
the 0
pope’s 0
letter 0
itself 0
does 0
not 0
contain 0
teachings 0
on 0
faith 0
and 0
morals, 0
it 0
does 0
point 0
toward 0
the 0
interpretations 0
of 0
the 0
Argentine 0
bishops 0
and 0
confirms 0
them 0
as 0
authentically 0
reflecting 0
his 0
own 0
mind. 0

Thus 0
together 0
the 0
two 0
documents 0
became 0
the 0
Holy 0
Father’s 0
authentic 0
magisterium 0
for 0
the 0
whole 0
church.” 0

What 0
Cardinal 0
Burke 0
rightly 0
describes 0
as 0
lacking 1
in 1
any 1
magisterial 1
weight 1
whatsoever—and, 1
in 0
fact, 0
in 0
dire 0
need 0
of 0
clarification 0
and 0
correction— 0
has 0
by 0
papal 0
fiat 0
been 0
declared 0
magisterial, 0
and 0
thus 0
binding 0
on 0
us 0
all. 0

Francis 1
made 1
it 1
clear 1
that 1
the 1
Argentine 1
bishops’ 1
interpretation 1
of 1
AL 1
allowing 1
public 1
adulterers 1
to 1
receive 1
Holy 1
Communion 1
“explains 1
precisely 1
the 1
meaning 1
of 1
Chapter 1
VIII 1
of 1
‘Amoris 1
Laetitia.’ 1
There 1
are 1
no 1
other 1
interpretations.” 1

I 0
would 0
imagine 0
this 0
outrageous 1
overreach 1
of 1
papal 1
authority 1
on 0
the 0
Pope's 0
part 0
would 0
make 0
it 0
ominously 1
clear 1
to 0
Cardinal 0
Burke 0
that 0
the 0
time 0
has 0
come 0
to 0
issue 0
his 0
public 0
correction 0
of 0
Pope 0
Francis's 0
erroneous 0
teaching. 0

The 0
moment, 0
it 0
would 0
seem, 0
has 0
come. 0

Cardinal 0
Burke, 0
please 0
and 0
in 0
God's 1
Holy 1
Name, 1
we 1
beg 1
you 1
to 1
act 1
now 1
-- 1
before 1
Pope 1
Francis 1
succeeds 1
in 1
tearing 1
the 1
Church 1
in 1
half 1
completely. 1

We 0
fear 0
that 0
your 0
silence 0
now, 0
in 0
the 0
face 0
of 0
this 1
latest 1
papal 1
travesty, 1
may 0
suggest 0
consent 0
to 0
the 0
claim 0
that 0
Amoris 0
Laetitia 0
is 0
magisterial, 0
and 0
thus 0
prove 0
more 0
damaging 0
than 0
if 0
you 0
had 0
never 0
raised 0
your 0
voice 0
at 0
all. 0

We 0
thank 0
God 0
for 0
the 0
courage 0
you've 0
shown 0
in 0
defending 0
His 0
Church 0
thus 0
far, 0
and 0
we 0
pray 0
he 0
will 0
continue 0
to 0
bless 0
and 0
protect 0
you 0
as 0
you 0
do 0
what 0
must 0
now 0
be 0
done. 0
