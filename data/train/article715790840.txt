Given 0 106 1
that 0 106 1
Pope 0 106 1
Francis 0 106 1
has, 0 106 1
since 0 106 1
that 0 106 1
interview 0 106 1
took 0 106 1
place, 0 106 1
attempted 0 106 1
to 0 106 1
make 0 106 1
the 0 106 1
Argentine 0 106 1
bishops’ 0 106 1
interpretation 0 106 1
of 0 106 1
AL 0 106 1
'magisterial'--an 0 106 1

January 0 106 1
9th 0 106 1
of 0 106 1
this 0 106 1

seem 0 106 1
to 0 106 1
take 0 106 1
on 0 106 1
new 0 106 1
relevancy. 0 106 1

In 0 106 2
my 0 106 2
interview 0 106 2
of 0 106 2
Raymond 0 106 2
Cardinal 0 106 2
Burke 0 106 2
less 0 106 2
than 0 106 2
one 0 106 2
year 0 106 2
ago, 0 106 2
I 0 106 2
asked 0 106 2
His 0 106 2
Eminence 0 106 2
to 0 106 2
clarify 0 106 2
what, 0 106 2
exactly, 0 106 2
is 0 106 2
the 0 106 2
level 0 106 2
of 0 106 2
authoritative 0 106 2
weight 0 106 2
of 0 106 2
Pope 0 106 2

post-synodal 0 106 2
exhortation, 0 106 2
Amoris 0 106 2

Now, 0 106 3
Cardinal 0 106 3
Francesco 0 106 3
Coccopalmerio, 0 106 3
president 0 106 3
of 0 106 3
the 0 106 3
Pontifical 0 106 3
Council 0 106 3
for 0 106 3
Legislative 0 106 3
Texts, 0 106 3
made 0 106 3
it 0 106 3
very 0 106 3
clear 0 106 3
to 0 106 3
the 0 106 3
Catholic 0 106 3
News 0 106 3
Service 0 106 3
on 0 106 3
December 0 106 3
5 0 106 3
what 0 106 3
the 0 106 3
Pope 0 106 3
is 0 106 3
up 0 106 3
to: 0 106 3
“The 0 106 3
fact 0 106 3
that 0 106 3
the 0 106 3
pope 0 106 3
requested 0 106 3
that 0 106 3
his 0 106 3
letter 0 106 3
and 0 106 3
the 0 106 3
interpretations 0 106 3
of 0 106 3
the 0 106 3
Buenos 0 106 3
Aires 0 106 3
bishops 0 106 3
be 0 106 3
published 0 106 3
in 0 106 3
the 0 106 3
AAS 0 106 3
means 0 106 3
that 0 106 3
His 0 106 3
Holiness 0 106 3
has 0 106 3
given 0 106 3
these 0 106 3
documents 0 106 3
a 0 106 3
particular 0 106 3
qualification 0 106 3
that 0 106 3
elevates 0 106 3
them 0 106 3
to 0 106 3
the 0 106 3
level 0 106 3
of 0 106 3
being 0 106 3
official 0 106 3
teachings 0 106 3
of 0 106 3
the 0 106 3
church. 0 106 3

While 0 106 4
the 0 106 4
content 0 106 4
of 0 106 4
the 0 106 4
pope’s 0 106 4
letter 0 106 4
itself 0 106 4
does 0 106 4
not 0 106 4
contain 0 106 4
teachings 0 106 4
on 0 106 4
faith 0 106 4
and 0 106 4
morals, 0 106 4
it 0 106 4
does 0 106 4
point 0 106 4
toward 0 106 4
the 0 106 4
interpretations 0 106 4
of 0 106 4
the 0 106 4
Argentine 0 106 4
bishops 0 106 4
and 0 106 4
confirms 0 106 4
them 0 106 4
as 0 106 4
authentically 0 106 4
reflecting 0 106 4
his 0 106 4
own 0 106 4
mind. 0 106 4

Thus 0 106 5
together 0 106 5
the 0 106 5
two 0 106 5
documents 0 106 5
became 0 106 5
the 0 106 5
Holy 0 106 5
Father’s 0 106 5
authentic 0 106 5
magisterium 0 106 5
for 0 106 5
the 0 106 5
whole 0 106 5
church.” 0 106 5

What 0 106 6
Cardinal 0 106 6
Burke 0 106 6
rightly 0 106 6
describes 0 106 6
as 0 106 6
lacking 1 106 6
in 1 106 6
any 1 106 6
magisterial 1 106 6
weight 1 106 6
whatsoever—and, 1 106 6
in 0 106 6
fact, 0 106 6
in 0 106 6
dire 0 106 6
need 0 106 6
of 0 106 6
clarification 0 106 6
and 0 106 6
correction— 0 106 6
has 0 106 6
by 0 106 6
papal 0 106 6
fiat 0 106 6
been 0 106 6
declared 0 106 6
magisterial, 0 106 6
and 0 106 6
thus 0 106 6
binding 0 106 6
on 0 106 6
us 0 106 6
all. 0 106 6

Francis 1 106 7
made 1 106 7
it 1 106 7
clear 1 106 7
that 1 106 7
the 1 106 7
Argentine 1 106 7
bishops’ 1 106 7
interpretation 1 106 7
of 1 106 7
AL 1 106 7
allowing 1 106 7
public 1 106 7
adulterers 1 106 7
to 1 106 7
receive 1 106 7
Holy 1 106 7
Communion 1 106 7
“explains 1 106 7
precisely 1 106 7
the 1 106 7
meaning 1 106 7
of 1 106 7
Chapter 1 106 7
VIII 1 106 7
of 1 106 7
‘Amoris 1 106 7
Laetitia.’ 1 106 7
There 1 106 7
are 1 106 7
no 1 106 7
other 1 106 7
interpretations.” 1 106 7

I 0 106 8
would 0 106 8
imagine 0 106 8
this 0 106 8
outrageous 1 106 8
overreach 1 106 8
of 1 106 8
papal 1 106 8
authority 1 106 8
on 0 106 8
the 0 106 8
Pope's 0 106 8
part 0 106 8
would 0 106 8
make 0 106 8
it 0 106 8
ominously 1 106 8
clear 1 106 8
to 0 106 8
Cardinal 0 106 8
Burke 0 106 8
that 0 106 8
the 0 106 8
time 0 106 8
has 0 106 8
come 0 106 8
to 0 106 8
issue 0 106 8
his 0 106 8
public 0 106 8
correction 0 106 8
of 0 106 8
Pope 0 106 8
Francis's 0 106 8
erroneous 0 106 8
teaching. 0 106 8

The 0 106 9
moment, 0 106 9
it 0 106 9
would 0 106 9
seem, 0 106 9
has 0 106 9
come. 0 106 9

Cardinal 0 106 10
Burke, 0 106 10
please 0 106 10
and 0 106 10
in 0 106 10
God's 1 106 10
Holy 1 106 10
Name, 1 106 10
we 1 106 10
beg 1 106 10
you 1 106 10
to 1 106 10
act 1 106 10
now 1 106 10
-- 1 106 10
before 1 106 10
Pope 1 106 10
Francis 1 106 10
succeeds 1 106 10
in 1 106 10
tearing 1 106 10
the 1 106 10
Church 1 106 10
in 1 106 10
half 1 106 10
completely. 1 106 10

We 0 106 11
fear 0 106 11
that 0 106 11
your 0 106 11
silence 0 106 11
now, 0 106 11
in 0 106 11
the 0 106 11
face 0 106 11
of 0 106 11
this 1 106 11
latest 1 106 11
papal 1 106 11
travesty, 1 106 11
may 0 106 11
suggest 0 106 11
consent 0 106 11
to 0 106 11
the 0 106 11
claim 0 106 11
that 0 106 11
Amoris 0 106 11
Laetitia 0 106 11
is 0 106 11
magisterial, 0 106 11
and 0 106 11
thus 0 106 11
prove 0 106 11
more 0 106 11
damaging 0 106 11
than 0 106 11
if 0 106 11
you 0 106 11
had 0 106 11
never 0 106 11
raised 0 106 11
your 0 106 11
voice 0 106 11
at 0 106 11
all. 0 106 11

We 0 106 11

thank 0 106 11

God 0 106 11

for 0 106 11

the 0 106 11

courage 0 106 11

you've 0 106 11

shown 0 106 11

in 0 106 11

defending 0 106 11

His 0 106 11

Church 0 106 11

thus 0 106 11

far, 0 106 11

and 0 106 11

we 0 106 11

pray 0 106 11

he 0 106 11

will 0 106 11

continue 0 106 11

to 0 106 11

bless 0 106 11

and 0 106 11

protect 0 106 11

you 0 106 11

as 0 106 11

you 0 106 11

do 0 106 11

what 0 106 11

must 0 106 11

now 0 106 11

be 0 106 11

done. 0 106 11
