The 0 68 14

don’t 0 68 14
know 0 68 14
exactly 0 68 14
when 0 68 14
this 0 68 14
happened, 0 68 14

it 0 68 14

"It's 0 68 15
hard 0 68 15

it 0 68 15
was 0 68 15

"Certainly, 0 68 16
more 0 68 16

"The 0 68 19

that 0 68 19
slowly 0 68 19

surely 0 68 19
squeezes 0 68 19

pulls 0 68 19
on 0 68 19
the 0 68 19

just 0 68 19
like 0 68 19
