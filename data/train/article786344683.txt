in 0

it 0
was 0
revealed 0
that 0
just 0
days 0
prior 0
to 0
the 0
April 0
15, 0
2014 0
email, 0
Schmidt 0
had 0
sent 0
another 0
email 0
in 0
which 0
he 0
expressed 0
his 0
eagerness 0
to 0
“fund” 0
the 0
campaign 0
efforts 0
and 0
wants 0
to 0
be 0
a 0
“head 0
outside 0
advisor.” 0
In 0
the 0
email 0
from 0
John 0
Podesta 0
to 0
Robby 0
Mook 0
we 0
learned 0
that: 0

I 0
met 0
with 0
Eric 0
Schmidt 0
tonight. 0

As 0
David 0
reported, 0
he’s 0
ready 0
to 0
fund, 0
advise 0
recruit 0
talent, 0
etc. 0

He 0
was 0
more 0
deferential 0
on 0
structure 0
than 0
I 0
expected. 0

Wasn’t 0
pushing 0
to 0
run 0
through 0
one 0
of 0
his 0
existing 0
firms. 0

Clearly 0
wants 0
to 0
be 0
head 0
outside 0
advisor, 0
but 0
didn’t 0
seem 0
like 0
he 0
wanted 0
to 0
push 0
others 0
out. 0

Clearly 0
wants 0
to 0
get 0
going. 0

He’s 0
still 0
in 0
DC 0
tomorrow 0
and 0
would 0
like 0
to 0
meet 0
with 0
you 0
if 0
you 0
are 0
in 0
DC 0
in 0
the 0
afternoon. 0

I 0
think 0
it’s 0
worth 0
doing. 0

You 0
around? 0

If 0
you 0
are, 0
and 0
want 0
to 0
meet 0
with 0
him, 0
maybe 0
the 0
four 0
of 0
