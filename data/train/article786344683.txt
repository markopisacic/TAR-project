the 0 426 26

Podesta 0 426 26
to 0 426 26
Robby 0 426 26
Mook 0 426 26
we 0 426 26
learned 0 426 26
that: 0 426 26

I 0 426 27
met 0 426 27
with 0 426 27
Eric 0 426 27
Schmidt 0 426 27
tonight. 0 426 27

As 0 426 28
David 0 426 28
reported, 0 426 28
he’s 0 426 28
ready 0 426 28
to 0 426 28
fund, 0 426 28
advise 0 426 28
recruit 0 426 28
talent, 0 426 28
etc. 0 426 28

He 0 426 29
was 0 426 29
more 0 426 29
deferential 0 426 29
on 0 426 29
structure 0 426 29
than 0 426 29
I 0 426 29
expected. 0 426 29

Wasn’t 0 426 30
pushing 0 426 30
to 0 426 30
run 0 426 30
through 0 426 30
one 0 426 30
of 0 426 30
his 0 426 30
existing 0 426 30
firms. 0 426 30

Clearly 0 426 31
wants 0 426 31
to 0 426 31
be 0 426 31
head 0 426 31
outside 0 426 31
advisor, 0 426 31
but 0 426 31
didn’t 0 426 31
seem 0 426 31
like 0 426 31
he 0 426 31
wanted 0 426 31
to 0 426 31
push 0 426 31
others 0 426 31
out. 0 426 31

Clearly 0 426 32
wants 0 426 32
to 0 426 32
get 0 426 32
going. 0 426 32

He’s 0 426 33
still 0 426 33
in 0 426 33
DC 0 426 33
tomorrow 0 426 33
and 0 426 33
would 0 426 33
like 0 426 33
to 0 426 33
meet 0 426 33
with 0 426 33
you 0 426 33
if 0 426 33
you 0 426 33
are 0 426 33
in 0 426 33
DC 0 426 33
in 0 426 33
the 0 426 33
afternoon. 0 426 33

I 0 426 34
think 0 426 34
it’s 0 426 34
worth 0 426 34
doing. 0 426 34

You 0 426 35
around? 0 426 35

If 0 426 36
you 0 426 36
are, 0 426 36
and 0 426 36
want 0 426 36
to 0 426 36
meet 0 426 36
with 0 426 36
him, 0 426 36
maybe 0 426 36
the 0 426 36
four 0 426 36
of 0 426 36
us 0 426 36
can 0 426 36
get 0 426 36
