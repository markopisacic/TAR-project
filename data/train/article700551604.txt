Will 0 40 0
Trump 0 40 0
Continue 0 40 0
the 0 40 0
CIA’s 0 40 0
JFK 0 40 0
Cover-Up? 0 40 0

Last 0 40 1
Friday, 0 40 1
President 0 40 1
Trump 0 40 1
made 0 40 1
the 0 40 1
following 0 40 1
announcement: 0 40 1

I 0 40 2
have 0 40 2
decided 0 40 2
not 0 40 2
to 0 40 2
block 0 40 2
release 0 40 2
of 0 40 2
the 0 40 2
CIA’s 0 40 2
remaining 0 40 2
JFK-assassination 0 40 2
related 0 40 2
records 0 40 2
except 0 40 2
for 0 40 2
those 0 40 2
records 0 40 2
that 0 40 2
directly 0 40 2
implicate 0 40 2
the 0 40 2
CIA 0 40 2
in 0 40 2
the 0 40 2
assassination, 0 40 2
which 0 40 2
will 0 40 2
continue 0 40 2
to 0 40 2
remain 0 40 2
secret.” 0 40 2

Okay, 0 40 3
he 0 40 3
didn’t 0 40 3
really 0 40 3
put 0 40 3
it 0 40 3
like 0 40 3
that. 0 40 3

But 0 40 4
that’s 0 40 4
the 0 40 4
potential 0 40 4
and 0 40 4
likely 0 40 4
import 0 40 4
of 0 40 4
his 0 40 4
announcement, 0 40 4
which 0 40 4
actually 0 40 4
read 0 40 4
as 0 40 4
follows: 0 40 4

Subject 0 40 5
to 0 40 5
the 0 40 5
receipt 0 40 5
of 0 40 5
further 0 40 5
information, 0 40 5
I 0 40 5
will 0 40 5
be 0 40 5
allowing, 0 40 5
as 0 40 5
President, 0 40 5
the 0 40 5
long 0 40 5
blocked 0 40 5
and 0 40 5
classified 0 40 5
JFK 0 40 5
FILES 0 40 5
to 0 40 5
be 0 40 5
opened.” 0 40 5
(Italics 0 40 5
added.) 0 40 5

The 0 40 6
operative 0 40 6
words, 0 40 6
of 0 40 6
course, 0 40 6
are: 0 40 6
“Subject 0 40 6
to 0 40 6
the 0 40 6
receipt 0 40 6
of 0 40 6
further 0 40 6
information….” 0 40 6

What 0 40 7
is 0 40 7
going 0 40 7
on 0 40 7
here? 0 40 7

Negotiations. 0 40 8

The 0 40 9
art 0 40 9
of 0 40 9
the 0 40 9
deal. 0 40 9

The 0 40 10
CIA 0 40 10
desperately 0 40 10
does 0 40 10
not 0 40 10
want 0 40 10
to 0 40 10
show 0 40 10
the 0 40 10
American 0 40 10
people 0 40 10
its 0 40 10
long-secret 0 40 10
JFK-related 0 40 10
records. 0 40 10

It 0 40 11
has 0 40 11
asked 0 40 11
Trump 0 40 11
to 0 40 11
continue 0 40 11
keeping 0 40 11
at 0 40 11
least 0 40 11
some 0 40 11
of 0 40 11
them 0 40 11
secret 0 40 11
notwithstanding 0 40 11
the 0 40 11
passage 0 40 11
of 0 40 11
more 0 40 11
than 0 40 11
50 0 40 11
years 0 40 11
since 0 40 11
the 0 40 11
Kennedy 0 40 11
assassination. 0 40 11

Under 0 40 12
long-established 0 40 12
custom 0 40 12
and 0 40 12
tradition 0 40 12
in 0 40 12
Washington, 0 40 12
D.C., 0 40 12
when 0 40 12
someone 0 40 12
asks 0 40 12
someone 0 40 12
else 0 40 12
for 0 40 12
a 0 40 12
favor, 0 40 12
the 0 40 12
person 0 40 12
who 0 40 12
is 0 40 12
in 0 40 12
a 0 40 12
position 0 40 12
to 0 40 12
grant 0 40 12
the 0 40 12
favor 0 40 12
demands 0 40 12
something 0 40 12
in 0 40 12
return. 0 40 12

That’s 0 40 13
where 0 40 13
the 0 40 13
negotiations 0 40 13
between 0 40 13
Trump 0 40 13
and 0 40 13
the 0 40 13
CIA 0 40 13
come 0 40 13
into 0 40 13
play. 0 40 13

Trump 0 40 14
wants 0 40 14
something 0 40 14
in 0 40 14
return. 0 40 14

We 0 40 15
don’t 0 40 15
know 0 40 15
what 0 40 15
— 0 40 15
maybe 0 40 15
laying 0 40 15
off 0 40 15
on 0 40 15
the 0 40 15
Russia 0 40 15
investigation 0 40 15
— 0 40 15
but 0 40 15
his 0 40 15
announcement 0 40 15
last 0 40 15
Friday 0 40 15
is 0 40 15
obviously 0 40 15
part 0 40 15
of 0 40 15
the 0 40 15
concluding 0 40 15
steps 0 40 15
of 0 40 15
such 0 40 15
negotiations. 0 40 15

Time 0 40 16
to 0 40 16
buy 0 40 16
old 0 40 16
US 0 40 16
gold 0 40 16
coins 0 40 16

What 0 40 17
Trump 0 40 17
has 0 40 17
done 0 40 17
with 0 40 17
his 0 40 17
announcement 0 40 17
is 0 40 17
send 0 40 17
a 0 40 17
clear 0 40 17
message 0 40 17
to 0 40 17
the 0 40 17
CIA: 0 40 17
“Give 0 40 17
me 0 40 17
what 0 40 17
I 0 40 17
want 0 40 17
and 0 40 17
I’ll 0 40 17
give 0 40 17
you 0 40 17
want 0 40 17
you 0 40 17
want. 0 40 17

Otherwise, 0 40 18
I 0 40 18
will 0 40 18
let 0 40 18
all 0 40 18
your 0 40 18
cherished 1 40 18
long-secret 1 40 18
records 1 40 18
relating 0 40 18
to 0 40 18
the 0 40 18
JFK 0 40 18
assassination 0 40 18
be 0 40 18
shown 0 40 18
to 0 40 18
the 0 40 18
American 0 40 18
people.” 0 40 18

Make 0 40 19
no 0 40 19
mistake 0 40 19
about 0 40 19
it: 0 40 19
A 0 40 19
deal 0 40 19
is 0 40 19
about 0 40 19
to 0 40 19
be 0 40 19
made. 0 40 19

The 0 40 20
CIA 0 40 20
will 0 40 20
cave. 0 40 20

It 0 40 21
will 0 40 21
end 0 40 21
up 0 40 21
giving 0 40 21
Trump 0 40 21
whatever 0 40 21
it 0 40 21
is 0 40 21
he 0 40 21
wants. 0 40 21

Trump 1 40 22
is 1 40 22
in 1 40 22
the 1 40 22
driver’s 1 40 22
seat 1 40 22
because 1 40 22
the 1 40 22
CIA 1 40 22
cannot 1 40 22
afford 1 40 22
to 1 40 22
permit 1 40 22
the 1 40 22
American 1 40 22
people 1 40 22
to 1 40 22
see 1 40 22
the 1 40 22
records 1 40 22
it 1 40 22
wants 1 40 22
to 1 40 22
continue 1 40 22
to 1 40 22
be 1 40 22
kept 1 40 22
secret. 1 40 22

And 0 40 23
once 1 40 23
the 1 40 23
CIA 1 40 23
gives 1 40 23
Trump 1 40 23
what 1 40 23
he 1 40 23
wants, 1 40 23
he 1 40 23
will 1 40 23
cave 1 40 23
and 1 40 23
give 1 40 23
the 1 40 23
CIA 1 40 23
the 1 40 23
continued 1 40 23
secrecy 1 40 23
it 1 40 23
so 1 40 23
desperately 1 40 23
needs. 1 40 23

All 0 40 24
this 0 40 24
will 0 40 24
happen 0 40 24
by 0 40 24
this 0 40 24
Thursday, 0 40 24
the 0 40 24
date 0 40 24
set 0 40 24
by 0 40 24
law 0 40 24
for 0 40 24
release 0 40 24
of 0 40 24
all 0 40 24
the 0 40 24
JFK 0 40 24
records 0 40 24
that 0 40 24
Trump 0 40 24
has 0 40 24
not 0 40 24
blocked. 0 40 24

Think 0 40 25
about 0 40 25
it: 0 40 25
The 0 40 25
CIA 0 40 25
has 0 40 25
asked 0 40 25
the 0 40 25
president 0 40 25
to 0 40 25
continue 0 40 25
secrecy 0 40 25
of 0 40 25
records 0 40 25
that 0 40 25
are 0 40 25
more 0 40 25
than 0 40 25
50 0 40 25
years 0 40 25
old 0 40 25
or, 0 40 25
apparently, 0 40 25
some 0 40 25
relating 0 40 25
to 0 40 25
secret 0 40 25
correspondence 0 40 25
between 0 40 25
the 0 40 25
CIA 0 40 25
and 0 40 25
the 0 40 25
Assassination 0 40 25
Records 0 40 25
Review 0 40 25
Board 0 40 25
back 0 40 25
in 0 40 25
the 0 40 25
1990s. 0 40 25

The 0 40 26
CIA’s 0 40 26
ground? 0 40 26

“National 0 40 27
security” 0 40 27
of 0 40 27
course, 0 40 27
the 1 40 27
two 1 40 27
most 1 40 27
important 1 40 27
and 1 40 27
meaningless 1 40 27
words 1 40 27
in 0 40 27
the 0 40 27
American 0 40 27
political 0 40 27
lexicon. 0 40 27

National 0 40 28
security? 0 40 28

Really? 0 40 29

Whatever 0 40 30
definition 0 40 30
that 0 40 30
one 0 40 30
might 0 40 30
put 0 40 30
on 0 40 30
that 0 40 30
nebulous 0 40 30
term, 0 40 30
no 1 40 30
reasonable 1 40 30
person 1 40 30
can 1 40 30
honestly 1 40 30
believe 1 40 30
that 0 40 30
the 0 40 30
release 0 40 30
of 0 40 30
50-year-old 0 40 30
records 0 40 30
are 0 40 30
going 0 40 30
to 0 40 30
result 1 40 30
in 1 40 30
the 1 40 30
United 1 40 30
States 1 40 30
falling 1 40 30
into 1 40 30
the 1 40 30
ocean 1 40 30
or 0 40 30
even 0 40 30
that 0 40 30
the 1 40 30
communists 1 40 30
are 1 40 30
going 1 40 30
to 1 40 30
take 1 40 30
over 1 40 30
the 1 40 30
federal 1 40 30
government. 1 40 30

The 0 40 31
CIA 0 40 31
says 0 40 31
that 0 40 31
releasing 0 40 31
its 0 40 31
decades-old 0 40 31
JFK 0 40 31
records 0 40 31
will 0 40 31
reveal 0 40 31
secret 0 40 31
“methods” 0 40 31
of 0 40 31
intelligence 0 40 31
gathering. 0 40 31

Really? 1 40 32

What, 1 40 33
like 1 40 33
the 1 40 33
CIA 1 40 33
was 1 40 33
using 1 40 33
typewriters 1 40 33
instead 1 40 33
of 1 40 33
computers 1 40 33
and 1 40 33
pay 1 40 33
telephones 1 40 33
instead 1 40 33
of 1 40 33
cell 1 40 33
phones? 1 40 33

What 0 40 34
is 0 40 34
amazing 0 40 34
(or 0 40 34
not) 0 40 34
is 0 40 34
the 1 40 34
extreme 1 40 34
nonchalance 1 40 34
of 0 40 34
the 0 40 34
mainstream 0 40 34
media 0 40 34
to 0 40 34
the 0 40 34
CIA’s 0 40 34
request 0 40 34
for 0 40 34
continued 0 40 34
secrecy. 0 40 34

That 0 40 35
should 0 40 35
be 0 40 35
big 0 40 35
news. 0 40 35

It’s 1 40 36
essentially 1 40 36
an 1 40 36
admission 1 40 36
of 1 40 36
guilt, 1 40 36
given 0 40 36
that 0 40 36
it 0 40 36
is 0 40 36
absolutely 1 40 36
ludicrous 1 40 36
to 0 40 36
think 0 40 36
that 0 40 36
“national 0 40 36
security” 0 40 36
would 0 40 36
be 0 40 36
threatened 0 40 36
by 0 40 36
the 0 40 36
release 0 40 36
of 0 40 36
the 0 40 36
CIA’s 0 40 36
long-secret 0 40 36
JFK-assassination-related 0 40 36
records. 0 40 36

You 0 40 37
see, 0 40 37
the 0 40 37
mainstream 0 40 37
media 0 40 37
starts 0 40 37
with 0 40 37
the 0 40 37
assumption 0 40 37
that 0 40 37
the 0 40 37
CIA 0 40 37
had 0 40 37
nothing 0 40 37
to 0 40 37
do 0 40 37
with 0 40 37
the 0 40 37
assassination. 0 40 37

In 0 40 38
their 0 40 38
minds, 0 40 38
the 0 40 38
assassination 0 40 38
was 0 40 38
committed 0 40 38
by 0 40 38
a 0 40 38
lone 1 40 38
nut 1 40 38
former 1 40 38
U.S. 1 40 38
Marine 1 40 38
communist, 1 40 38
one 0 40 38
who 0 40 38
had 0 40 38
no 0 40 38
motive 0 40 38
to 0 40 38
kill 0 40 38
the 0 40 38
president. 0 40 38

Such 0 40 39
being 0 40 39
the 0 40 39
case, 0 40 39
the 0 40 39
mainstream 0 40 39
media, 0 40 39
deferring 0 40 39
to 0 40 39
the 0 40 39
CIA, 0 40 39
automatically 0 40 39
concludes 0 40 39
that 0 40 39
its 0 40 39
wish 0 40 39
to 0 40 39
continue 0 40 39
keeping 0 40 39
secret 0 40 39
has 0 40 39
to 0 40 39
be 0 40 39
based 0 40 39
on 0 40 39
“national 0 40 39
security” 0 40 39
grounds 0 40 39
rather 0 40 39
than 0 40 39
an 0 40 39
attempt 0 40 39
by 0 40 39
the 0 40 39
CIA 0 40 39
to 0 40 39
continue 0 40 39
its 0 40 39
cover-up 0 40 39
of 0 40 39
its 0 40 39
assassination 0 40 39
of 0 40 39
the 0 40 39
president. 0 40 39

Let’s 0 40 40
proceed 0 40 40
from 0 40 40
the 0 40 40
opposite 0 40 40
assumption: 0 40 40
That 0 40 40
the 0 40 40
CIA, 0 40 40
in 0 40 40
partnership 0 40 40
with 0 40 40
the 0 40 40
military 0 40 40
and 0 40 40
the 0 40 40
Mafia, 0 40 40
orchestrated 0 40 40
the 0 40 40
assassination 0 40 40
by 0 40 40
framing 0 40 40
a 0 40 40
former 0 40 40
U.S. 0 40 40
Marine 0 40 40
who 0 40 40
was 0 40 40
then 0 40 40
working 0 40 40
for 0 40 40
U.S. 0 40 40
intelligence, 0 40 40
either 0 40 40
Navy 0 40 40
intelligence, 0 40 40
the 0 40 40
CIA, 0 40 40
or 0 40 40
the 0 40 40
FBI, 0 40 40
or 0 40 40
a 0 40 40
combination 0 40 40
of 0 40 40
all 0 40 40
three. 0 40 40

Don’t 0 40 41
forget, 0 40 41
after 0 40 41
all, 0 40 41
that 0 40 41
that’s 0 40 41
what 0 40 41
Oswald 0 40 41
said. 0 40 41

He 0 40 42
said 0 40 42
he 0 40 42
was 0 40 42
being 0 40 42
framed. 0 40 42

Yet, 0 40 43
from 0 40 43
the 0 40 43
very 0 40 43
beginning, 0 40 43
the 1 40 43
mainstream 1 40 43
media 1 40 43
has 1 40 43
never 1 40 43
given 1 40 43
any 1 40 43
serious 1 40 43
consideration 1 40 43
to 0 40 43
the 0 40 43
possibility 0 40 43
that 0 40 43
Oswald 0 40 43
was 0 40 43
framed 0 40 43
for 0 40 43
the 0 40 43
crime. 0 40 43

Instead, 0 40 44
they 0 40 44
have 0 40 44
steadfastly 0 40 44
stuck 0 40 44
with 0 40 44
the 0 40 44
official 0 40 44
story, 0 40 44
one 0 40 44
that 0 40 44
has 0 40 44
all 0 40 44
the 0 40 44
characteristics 0 40 44
of 0 40 44
a 0 40 44
pat 1 40 44
frame-up: 1 40 44
That 0 40 44
Oswald 0 40 44
acted 0 40 44
alone 0 40 44
or 0 40 44
possibly 0 40 44
acted 0 40 44
in 0 40 44
concert 0 40 44
with 0 40 44
others, 0 40 44
both 0 40 44
of 0 40 44
which 0 40 44
lead 0 40 44
to 0 40 44
nothing 0 40 44
but 0 40 44
dead 0 40 44
ends, 0 40 44
contradictions, 0 40 44
and 0 40 44
anomalies. 0 40 44

Now, 0 40 45
let’s 0 40 45
assume 0 40 45
instead 0 40 45
that 0 40 45
Oswald 0 40 45
was 0 40 45
telling 0 40 45
the 0 40 45
truth 0 40 45
when 0 40 45
he 0 40 45
said 0 40 45
he 0 40 45
was 0 40 45
being 0 40 45
framed. 0 40 45

In 0 40 46
that 0 40 46
case, 0 40 46
it 0 40 46
would 0 40 46
be 0 40 46
imperative 0 40 46
that 0 40 46
the 0 40 46
CIA 0 40 46
and 0 40 46
the 0 40 46
military 0 40 46
keep 0 40 46
as 0 40 46
tight 0 40 46
a 0 40 46
lid 0 40 46
on 0 40 46
their 0 40 46
records 0 40 46
as 0 40 46
possible 0 40 46
to 0 40 46
ensure 0 40 46
that 0 40 46
investigators 0 40 46
or 0 40 46
investigative 0 40 46
reporters 0 40 46
would 0 40 46
have 0 40 46
a 0 40 46
difficult 0 40 46
time 0 40 46
piercing 0 40 46
through 0 40 46
to 0 40 46
the 0 40 46
circumstantial 0 40 46
evidence 0 40 46
that 0 40 46
establishes 0 40 46
the 0 40 46
frame-up. 0 40 46

As 0 40 47
part 0 40 47
of 0 40 47
the 0 40 47
frame-up, 0 40 47
the 0 40 47
CIA 0 40 47
would 0 40 47
have 0 40 47
to 0 40 47
fortify 0 40 47
the 0 40 47
persona 0 40 47
of 0 40 47
Oswald, 0 40 47
its 0 40 47
intelligence 0 40 47
agent, 0 40 47
as 0 40 47
a 0 40 47
purported 1 40 47
communist. 1 40 47

That 1 40 48
would 1 40 48
enable 1 40 48
the 1 40 48
CIA 1 40 48
to 1 40 48
blame 1 40 48
the 1 40 48
assassination 1 40 48
on 1 40 48
a 1 40 48
communist, 1 40 48
which, 0 40 48
not 0 40 48
coincidentally, 0 40 48
was 0 40 48
the 0 40 48
advice 0 40 48
that 0 40 48
the 0 40 48
Pentagon 0 40 48
and 0 40 48
the 0 40 48
CIA 0 40 48
were 0 40 48
doling 0 40 48
out 0 40 48
to 0 40 48
Latin 0 40 48
American 0 40 48
military 0 40 48
dictatorships 0 40 48
at 0 40 48
the 0 40 48
School 0 40 48
of 0 40 48
the 0 40 48
Americas. 0 40 48

In 0 40 49
cases 0 40 49
of 0 40 49
covert 0 40 49
state-sponsored 0 40 49
assassinations, 0 40 49
Latin 0 40 49
American 0 40 49
regimes 0 40 49
were 0 40 49
taught, 0 40 49
a 1 40 49
good 1 40 49
strategy 1 40 49
was 1 40 49
to 1 40 49
blame 1 40 49
the 1 40 49
assassination 1 40 49
on 1 40 49
a 1 40 49
communist 1 40 49
because 1 40 49
then 1 40 49
they 1 40 49
could 1 40 49
smear 1 40 49
anyone 1 40 49
who 1 40 49
challenged 1 40 49
the 1 40 49
official 1 40 49
story 1 40 49
as 1 40 49
a 1 40 49
communist 1 40 49
sympathizer. 1 40 49

It 0 40 50
would 0 40 50
also 0 40 50
explain 0 40 50
why 0 40 50
the 0 40 50
CIA 0 40 50
was 0 40 50
closely 0 40 50
monitoring 0 40 50
Oswald’s 0 40 50
movements 0 40 50
prior 0 40 50
to 0 40 50
the 0 40 50
assassination, 0 40 50
something 0 40 50
else 0 40 50
that 0 40 50
the 0 40 50
CIA 0 40 50
kept 0 40 50
secret 0 40 50
for 0 40 50
decades. 0 40 50

They 1 40 51
had 1 40 51
to 1 40 51
make 1 40 51
certain 1 40 51
that 1 40 51
Oswald 1 40 51
was 1 40 51
not 1 40 51
on 1 40 51
to 1 40 51
them 1 40 51
and 1 40 51
had 1 40 51
not 1 40 51
discovered 1 40 51
that 1 40 51
he 1 40 51
was 1 40 51
being 1 40 51
set 1 40 51
up 1 40 51
for 1 40 51
a 1 40 51
frame-up. 1 40 51

The 0 40 52
first 0 40 52
organization 0 40 52
that 0 40 52
came 0 40 52
out 0 40 52
with 0 40 52
a 0 40 52
press 0 40 52
release 0 40 52
advertising 0 40 52
Oswald’s 0 40 52
bona 0 40 52
fides 0 40 52
was 0 40 52
the 0 40 52
DRE, 0 40 52
an 0 40 52
anti-communist 0 40 52
group 0 40 52
in 0 40 52
New 0 40 52
Orleans 0 40 52
with 0 40 52
which 0 40 52
Oswald 0 40 52
had 0 40 52
had 0 40 52
contact. 0 40 52

What 0 40 53
no 0 40 53
one 0 40 53
knew 0 40 53
at 0 40 53
the 0 40 53
time, 0 40 53
and 0 40 53
what 0 40 53
the 0 40 53
CIA 0 40 53
intentionally 0 40 53
kept 0 40 53
secret 0 40 53
for 0 40 53
decades, 0 40 53
was 0 40 53
that 0 40 53
the 0 40 53
DRE 0 40 53
was 0 40 53
a 0 40 53
CIA 0 40 53
front 0 40 53
organization. 0 40 53

It 0 40 54
was 0 40 54
being 0 40 54
generously 0 40 54
funded 0 40 54
by 0 40 54
the 0 40 54
CIA 0 40 54
and 0 40 54
controlled 0 40 54
by 0 40 54
a 0 40 54
secret 0 40 54
CIA 0 40 54
agent 0 40 54
named 0 40 54
George 0 40 54
Joannides, 0 40 54
which 0 40 54
the 0 40 54
CIA 0 40 54
would 0 40 54
intentionally 0 40 54
keep 0 40 54
secret 0 40 54
from 0 40 54
the 0 40 54
Warren 0 40 54
Commission 0 40 54
in 0 40 54
the 0 40 54
1960s, 0 40 54
the 0 40 54
House 0 40 54
Select 0 40 54
Committee 0 40 54
in 0 40 54
the 0 40 54
1970s, 0 40 54
and 0 40 54
the 0 40 54
Assassination 0 40 54
Records 0 40 54
Review 0 40 54
Board 0 40 54
in 0 40 54
the 0 40 54
1990s. 0 40 54

But 0 40 55
there 0 40 55
was 0 40 55
another 0 40 55
big 0 40 55
operation 0 40 55
to 0 40 55
establish 0 40 55
Oswald’s 0 40 55
communist 0 40 55
bona 0 40 55
fides 0 40 55
before 0 40 55
the 0 40 55
assassination. 0 40 55

It 0 40 56
had 0 40 56
to 0 40 56
do 0 40 56
with 0 40 56
Oswald’s 0 40 56
trip 0 40 56
to 0 40 56
Mexico 0 40 56
City, 0 40 56
where 0 40 56
he 0 40 56
visited 0 40 56
the 0 40 56
Cuban 0 40 56
and 0 40 56
Soviet 0 40 56
embassies. 0 40 56

Something 1 40 57
dreadful 1 40 57
obviously 0 40 57
went 0 40 57
wrong 0 40 57
with 0 40 57
that 0 40 57
part 0 40 57
of 0 40 57
the 0 40 57
operation 0 40 57
because 0 40 57
the 0 40 57
official 0 40 57
investigation 0 40 57
into 0 40 57
it 0 40 57
was 0 40 57
quickly 0 40 57
shut 0 40 57
down 0 40 57
during 0 40 57
the 0 40 57
early 0 40 57
post-assassination 0 40 57
period. 0 40 57

Today, 0 40 58
Oswald’s 0 40 58
Mexico 0 40 58
City 0 40 58
trip, 0 40 58
which 0 40 58
is 0 40 58
part 0 40 58
of 0 40 58
those 0 40 58
CIA 0 40 58
records 0 40 58
ready 0 40 58
to 0 40 58
be 0 40 58
released, 0 40 58
is 0 40 58
still 0 40 58
shrouded 0 40 58
in 0 40 58
mystery. 0 40 58

The 0 40 59
CIA’s 0 40 59
continued 0 40 59
secrecy 0 40 59
in 0 40 59
the 0 40 59
JFK 0 40 59
assassination 0 40 59
is 0 40 59
no 0 40 59
big 0 40 59
surprise. 0 40 59

As 0 40 60
I 0 40 60
wrote 0 40 60
in 0 40 60
my 0 40 60
October 0 40 60
11 0 40 60
article, 0 40 60
“Will 0 40 60
Trump 0 40 60
Make 0 40 60
a 0 40 60
Deal 0 40 60
with 0 40 60
the 0 40 60
CIA 0 40 60
on 0 40 60
JFK 0 40 60
Records?,” 0 40 60
the 0 40 60
CIA 0 40 60
is 0 40 60
between 0 40 60
a 0 40 60
rock 0 40 60
and 0 40 60
a 0 40 60
hard 0 40 60
place. 0 40 60

On 0 40 61
the 0 40 61
one 0 40 61
hand, 0 40 61
it 1 40 61
knows 1 40 61
that 1 40 61
those 1 40 61
records 1 40 61
will 1 40 61
further 1 40 61
implicate 1 40 61
the 1 40 61
CIA 1 40 61
in 1 40 61
the 1 40 61
Kennedy 1 40 61
assassination. 1 40 61

On 0 40 62
the 0 40 62
other 0 40 62
hand, 0 40 62
it 0 40 62
knows 0 40 62
that 0 40 62
by 1 40 62
seeking 1 40 62
continued 1 40 62
secrecy, 1 40 62
it’s 1 40 62
essentially 1 40 62
an 1 40 62
implicit 1 40 62
acknowledgment 1 40 62
of 1 40 62
guilt. 1 40 62

Not 0 40 63
surprisingly, 0 40 63
it 0 40 63
is 0 40 63
choosing 0 40 63
the 0 40 63
latter 0 40 63
course, 0 40 63
especially 0 40 63
because 1 40 63
it 1 40 63
knows 1 40 63
that 1 40 63
its 1 40 63
assets 1 40 63
and 1 40 63
allies 1 40 63
in 1 40 63
the 1 40 63
mainstream 1 40 63
press 1 40 63
will 1 40 63
continue 1 40 63
to 1 40 63
come 1 40 63
to 1 40 63
its 1 40 63
defense 1 40 63
with 0 40 63
respect 0 40 63
to 0 40 63
its 0 40 63
ridiculous 0 40 63
claim 0 40 63
of 0 40 63
“national 0 40 63
security.” 0 40 63

Do 0 40 64
the 0 40 64
CIA’s 0 40 64
long-secret 0 40 64
records 0 40 64
contain 0 40 64
a 0 40 64
video-taped 0 40 64
confession? 0 40 64

Of 0 40 65
course 0 40 65
not. 0 40 65

And 0 40 66
they 0 40 66
don’t 0 40 66
contain 0 40 66
any 0 40 66
reference 0 40 66
to 0 40 66
assassinating 0 40 66
Kennedy. 0 40 66

The 0 40 67
CIA’s 0 40 67
practice 0 40 67
from 0 40 67
the 0 40 67
very 0 40 67
beginning 0 40 67
has 0 40 67
been 0 40 67
to 0 40 67
not 0 40 67
put 0 40 67
any 0 40 67
reference 0 40 67
to 0 40 67
a 0 40 67
state-sponsored 0 40 67
assassination 0 40 67
into 0 40 67
writing. 0 40 67

But 0 40 68
there 0 40 68
has 0 40 68
to 0 40 68
be 0 40 68
a 0 40 68
reason 0 40 68
why 0 40 68
the 0 40 68
CIA 0 40 68
chose 0 40 68
to 0 40 68
keep 0 40 68
this 0 40 68
particular 0 40 68
batch 0 40 68
of 0 40 68
records 0 40 68
secret 0 40 68
for 0 40 68
more 0 40 68
than 0 40 68
50 0 40 68
years. 0 40 68

Those 0 40 69
long-secret 0 40 69
records 0 40 69
undoubtedly 0 40 69
include 0 40 69
small 0 40 69
bits 0 40 69
of 0 40 69
important 0 40 69
circumstantial 0 40 69
evidence 0 40 69
that 0 40 69
fill 0 40 69
out 0 40 69
even 0 40 69
further 0 40 69
the 0 40 69
mosaic 0 40 69
of 0 40 69
a 0 40 69
regime-change 0 40 69
operation 0 40 69
that 0 40 69
took 0 40 69
place 0 40 69
in 0 40 69
Dallas 0 40 69
in 0 40 69
November 0 40 69
1963, 0 40 69
the 0 40 69
same 0 40 69
types 0 40 69
of 0 40 69
regime-change 0 40 69
operation 0 40 69
that 0 40 69
took 0 40 69
place 0 40 69
in 0 40 69
Iran 0 40 69
in 0 40 69
1953, 0 40 69
Guatemala 0 40 69
in 0 40 69
1954, 0 40 69
Cuba 0 40 69
in 0 40 69
1960-1963, 0 40 69
Congo 0 40 69
in 0 40 69
1961, 0 40 69
and 0 40 69
Chile 0 40 69
in 0 40 69
1973, 0 40 69
all 0 40 69
of 0 40 69
which 0 40 69
the 1 40 69
CIA 1 40 69
steadfastly 1 40 69
kept 1 40 69
secret 1 40 69
from 1 40 69
the 1 40 69
American 1 40 69
people. 1 40 69

In 0 40 70
1953, 0 40 70
the 0 40 70
CIA 0 40 70
was 0 40 70
in 0 40 70
the 0 40 70
process 0 40 70
of 0 40 70
developing 0 40 70
a 0 40 70
top-secret 0 40 70
manual 0 40 70
on 0 40 70
assassinations, 0 40 70
one 0 40 70
that 0 40 70
showed 0 40 70
