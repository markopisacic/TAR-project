His 0
lawyer, 0
Ronald 0
Daigle, 0
told 0
Fox 0
News 0
on 0
Monday 0
that 0
the 0
lawsuit, 0
which 0
he 0
expects 0
to 0
file 0
soon 0
in 0
Manhattan, 0
will 0
name 0
the 0
U.S. 0
Department 0
of 0
Justice, 0
former 0
FBI 0
Director 0
James 0
Comey 0
and 0
former 0
President 0
Barack 0
Obama 0
as 0
defendants, 0
among 0
others. 0

“They 0
interpreted 0
the 0
law 0
in 0
my 0
case 0
to 0
say 0
it 0
was 0
criminal,” 0
Saucier 0
told 0
Fox 0
News, 0
referring 0
to 0
prosecuting 0
authorities 0
in 0
his 0
case, 0
“but 1
they 1
didn’t 1
prosecute 1
Hillary 1
Clinton. 1

Hillary 0
is 0
still 0
walking 0
free. 0

Two 1
guys 1
on 1
my 1
ship 1
did 1
the 1
same 1
thing 1
and 1
weren’t 1
treated 1
as 1
criminals. 1

We 0
want 0
them 0
to 0
correct 0
the 0
wrong.” 0
Daigle 0
said 0
that 0
a 0
notice 0
about 0
the 0
pending 0
lawsuit 0
was 0
sent 0
to 0
the 0
Department 0
of 0
Justice 0
and 0
others 0
included 0
in 0
it 0
in 0
December. 0

There 0
is 0
usually 0
a 0
six-month 0
period 0
that 0
must 0
lapse 0
before 0
the 0
lawsuit 0
actually 0
is 0
filed. 0

“We’ll 0
highlight 0
the 0
differences 0
in 0
the 0
way 0
Hillary 0
Clinton 0
was 0
prosecuted 0
and 0
how 0
my 0
client 0
was 0
prosecuted,” 0
Daigle 0
said. 0

“We’re 0
seeking 0
to 0
cast 0
a 0
light 0
on 0
this 0
to 0
show 0
that 0
there’s 0
a 0
two-tier 0
justice 0
system 0
and 0
we 0
want 0
it 0
to 0
be 0
corrected.” 0

Saucier's 0
attorneys 0
attempted 0
to 0
use 0
the 0
Hillary 0
Clinton 0
defense 0
to 0
get 0
him 0
out 0
of 0
hot 0
water 0
for 0
taking 0
pictures 0
of 0
classified 0
systems 0
aboard 0
the 0
USS 0
Alexandria 0
in 0
2009. 0

Prosecutors 0
sloughed 0
off 0
the 0
defense, 0
saying 0
it 0
was 0
essentially 0
“grasping 0
at 0
highly 0
imaginative 0
and 0
speculative 0
straws 0
in 0
trying 0
to 0
further 0
draw 0
a 0
comparison 0
to 0
the 0
matter 0
of 0
Secretary 0
Hillary 0
Clinton 0
based 0
upon 0
virtually 0
no 0
understanding 0
and 0
knowledge 0
of 0
the 0
facts 0
involved, 0
the 0
information 0
at 0
issue, 0
not 0
to 0
mention 0
any 0
issues 0
if 0
intent 0
and 0
knowledge.” 0

Saucier 0
confessed 0
to 0
taking 0
photos 0
of 0
the 0
submarine 0
back 0
in 0
2009 0
when 0
he 0
served 0
as 0
a 0
22-year-old 0
machinist 0
mate, 0
saying 0
he 0
wanted 0
to 0
show 0
the 0
pictures 0
to 0
his 0
family 0
and 0
future 0
children. 0

Following 0
an 0
interview 0
with 0
the 0
FBI 0
in 0
2012, 0
he 0
destroyed 0
all 0
evidence 0
of 0
the 0
pictures, 0
meaning 0
the 0
Naval 0
Criminal 0
Investigative 0
Service 0
could 0
not 0
confirm 0
his 0
claims 0
that 0
he 0
did 0
not 0
share 0
the 0
photos 0
with 0
unauthorized 0
people. 0

“It 0
was 0
a 0
foolish 1
mistake 0
by 0
a 0
very 0
young 0
man,” 0
Saucier’s 0
lawyer, 0
Greg 0
Rinckey, 0
said. 0

“It’s 0
a 0
very 0
sad 0
case 0
because 0
Kristian 0
Saucier 0
is 0
a 1
fine 1
young 1
man. 1

We 0
don’t 0
believe 0
this 0
was 0
really 0
his 0
true 0
character.” 0

“My 0
case 0
was 0
usually 0
something 0
handled 0
by 0
military 0
courts,” 0
Saucier 0
said. 0

“They 1
used 1
me 1
as 1
an 1
example 1
because 1
of 1
[the 1
backlash 1
over] 1
Hillary 1
Clinton,” 1
he 0
continued, 0
alleging 0
his 0
life 0
was 0
ruined 0
for 0
political 0
reasons. 0

President 0
Trump 0
had 0
spoken 0
of 0
his 0
support 0
of 0
Saucier 0
on 0
the 0
campaign 0
trail 0
and 0
blasted 0
the 0
Obama 0
administration's 0
handling 0
of 0
his 0
case. 0

“With 0
a 0
pardon, 0
there’s 0
no 0
magic 0
wand 0
that 0
gets 0
waved 0
and 0
makes 0
everything 0
right,” 0
Saucier 0
said, 0
“But 0
I 0
try 0
to 0
stay 0
positive 0
and 0
look 0
forward.” 0

That's 0
a 0
good 0
attitude 0
considering 0
he 0
has 0
had 0
his 0
cars 0
repossessed 0
and 0
is 0
in 0
a 0
tremendous 1
amount 0
of 0
debt 0
due 0
to 0
his 0
incarceration 0
and 0
now 0
having 0
a 0
felony 0
on 0
his 0
record. 0

But 0
hey, 0
Hillary 0
is 0
free, 0
right? 0

That's 0
all 0
that 0
matters, 0
cause 0
after 0
all, 0
they're 0
(Bill 0
and 0
Hillary) 0
good 0
people, 0
aren't 0
they, 0
Mr. 0
President? 0

I 0
think 0
it's 0
great 0
that 0
Mr. 0
Saucier 0
has 0
been 0
pardoned, 0
I 0
really 0
do, 0
but 0
I 0
continue 0
to 0
ask 0
what 0
a 0
lot 0
of 0
Americans 1
continue 0
to 0
ask, 0
why 0
does 0
the 1
known 1
criminal 1
Hillary 0
Clinton 0
remain 0
at 0
large 0
in 0
our 1
country 1
with 0
her 0
corrupt 1
foundation 0
taking 0
in 0
billions, 0
her 0
trashing 1
our 1
Republic 1
and 0
continuing 0
to 0
have 0
a 0
national 0
voice? 0

The 1
American 1
people 1
weren't 0
promised 0
pardons, 0
we 0
were 0
promised 0
a 0
special 0
counsel 0
to 0
dig 0
into 0
the 0
Clintons 0
and 0
bring 0
about 0
justice. 0

It's 0
time 0
that 0
occurred. 0
