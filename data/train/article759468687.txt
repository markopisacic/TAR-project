Once 0 438 2
again 0 438 2
this 0 438 2
year 0 438 2
we 0 438 2
see 0 438 2
that 0 438 2
Ramadan 1 438 2
is 1 438 2
quintessentially 1 438 2
the 1 438 2
month 1 438 2
of 1 438 2
jihad. 1 438 2

A 0 438 3
jihad 0 438 3
group 0 438 3
explained 0 438 3
it 0 438 3
back 0 438 3
in 0 438 3
2012: 0 438 3
“The 0 438 3

and 1 438 3
death 1 438 3
for 1 438 3
Allah. 1 438 3

It 0 438 4
is 0 438 4
a 0 438 4

Referring 0 438 4
to 0 438 4
a 0 438 4

that 0 438 4
happened 0 438 4
at 0 438 4
that 0 438 4
time, 0 438 4
the 0 438 4
message 0 438 4
continued: 0 438 4
“One 0 438 4

So 0 438 17
which 0 438 17
is 0 438 17
it? 0 438 17

Does 0 438 18
Ramadan 0 438 18
remind 0 438 18
us 0 438 18
of 0 438 18
“the 0 438 18
richness 0 438 18
Muslims 0 438 18
add 0 438 18

the 1 438 18

of 1 438 18
American 1 438 18
life,” 1 438 18
or 0 438 18
is 0 438 18
Ramadan 0 438 18
“a 0 438 18
month 0 438 18
of 0 438 18
calamity 0 438 18
everywhere 0 438 18
for 0 438 18
nonbelievers”? 0 438 18

Islam’s 1 438 19
core 1 438 19
beliefs 1 438 19
make 1 438 19
it 1 438 19
clear 1 438 19
that 1 438 19
the 1 438 19
latter 1 438 19
statement 1 438 19
is 1 438 19
closer 1 438 19
to 1 438 19
the 1 438 19
truth. 1 438 19

During 0 438 20
Ramadan, 0 438 20
Muslims 0 438 20
are 0 438 20
exhorted 0 438 20
to 0 438 20
renew 0 438 20
and 0 438 20
deepen 0 438 20
their 0 438 20
devotion 0 438 20
to 0 438 20
Allah. 0 438 20

Hence 0 438 21
it 0 438 21
is 0 438 21
a 0 438 21
time 0 438 21
when 0 438 21
they’re 0 438 21
supposed 0 438 21
to 0 438 21
grow 0 438 21
more 0 438 21
generous 0 438 21
and 0 438 21
kind 0 438 21
toward 0 438 21
their 0 438 21
fellow 0 438 21
Muslims. 0 438 21

However, 0 438 22
the 0 438 22
Qur’an 0 438 22
says: 0 438 22
“Muhammad 0 438 22
is 0 438 22
the 0 438 22
Messenger 0 438 22
of 0 438 22
Allah, 0 438 22
and 0 438 22
those 0 438 22
who 0 438 22
are 0 438 22
with 0 438 22
him 0 438 22
are 0 438 22
severe 1 438 22
against 1 438 22
disbelievers, 0 438 22
and 0 438 22
merciful 0 438 22
among 0 438 22
themselves” 0 438 22
(48:29). 0 438 22

If 0 438 23
the 0 438 23
Ramadan 0 438 23
imperative 0 438 23
is 0 438 23
to 0 438 23
become 0 438 23
more 0 438 23
devout, 0 438 23
the 0 438 23
Muslim 0 438 23
who 0 438 23
applies 0 438 23
himself 0 438 23
diligently 0 438 23
to 0 438 23
the 0 438 23
Ramadan 0 438 23
observance 0 438 23
will 0 438 23
simultaneously 0 438 23
become 0 438 23
more 0 438 23
both 0 438 23
merciful 0 438 23
to 0 438 23
his 0 438 23
fellow 0 438 23
Muslims 0 438 23
and 0 438 23
more 1 438 23
severe 1 438 23
against 1 438 23
the 0 438 23
unbelievers. 0 438 23

Murdering 1 438 24
infidels 1 438 24
thus 1 438 24
doesn’t 1 438 24
contradict 1 438 24
the 1 438 24
spirit 1 438 24
of 1 438 24
Ramadan; 1 438 24
it 1 438 24
embodies 1 438 24
it. 1 438 24

in 0 438 25
a 0 438 25
2010 0 438 25
article 0 438 25
that 0 438 25
the 0 438 25
idea 0 438 25
of 0 438 25
Ramadan 0 438 25
as 0 438 25
a 0 438 25
time 0 438 25
for 0 438 25
warfare 0 438 25
against 0 438 25
infidels 1 438 25
went 0 438 25
back 0 438 25
to 0 438 25
Muhammad’s 0 438 25
time: 0 438 25
“The 0 438 25
month 0 438 25
of 0 438 25
Ramadan 0 438 25
in 0 438 25
the 0 438 25
life 0 438 25
of 0 438 25
the 0 438 25
Prophet 0 438 25
(pbuh) 0 438 25
and 0 438 25
the 0 438 25
righteous 0 438 25
ancestors 0 438 25
was 0 438 25
a 0 438 25
month 0 438 25
of 0 438 25
forthcoming. 0 438 25

The 0 438 26
greatest 0 438 26
battles 0 438 26
during 0 438 26
the 0 438 26
lifetime 0 438 26
of 0 438 26
the 0 438 26
Prophet 0 438 26
(pbuh) 0 438 26
occurred 0 438 26
in 0 438 26
this 1 438 26
blessed 1 438 26
month, 1 438 26
the 1 438 26
month 1 438 26
of 1 438 26
jihad, 1 438 26
zeal 0 438 26
and 0 438 26
enthusiasm.” 0 438 26

Trump 0 438 27
was, 0 438 27
unfortunately, 0 438 27
following 0 438 27
the 0 438 27
example 0 438 27
of 0 438 27
his 0 438 27
two 0 438 27
immediate 0 438 27
predecessors 0 438 27
when 0 438 27
he 0 438 27
claimed 0 438 27
that 0 438 27
“Ramadan 0 438 27
reminds 0 438 27
us 0 438 27
of 0 438 27
the 0 438 27
richness 0 438 27
Muslims 0 438 27
add 0 438 27
to 1 438 27
the 1 438 27
religious 1 438 27
tapestry 1 438 27
of 1 438 27
American 1 438 27
life,” 1 438 27
and 0 438 27
was 0 438 27
severely 1 438 27
misleading 1 438 27
the 1 438 27
American 1 438 27
people. 1 438 27

Ironically, 0 438 28
even 0 438 28
in 0 438 28
doing 0 438 28
this 0 438 28
he 0 438 28
is 0 438 28
likely 0 438 28
to 0 438 28
fail 0 438 28
to 0 438 28
satisfy 0 438 28
Muslims, 0 438 28
or 0 438 28
anyone. 0 438 28

After 0 438 29
all, 0 438 29
after 0 438 29
the 0 438 29
Trump 0 438 29
White 0 438 29
House 0 438 29
issued 0 438 29
a 0 438 29
similar 0 438 29
statement 0 438 29
last 0 438 29
year, 0 438 29
the 0 438 29
Washington 0 438 29
Post 0 438 29
ran 0 438 29
a 0 438 29
lengthy 0 438 29
piece 0 438 29
in 0 438 29
which 0 438 29
several 0 438 29
Muslims 0 438 29
explained 0 438 29
why 0 438 29
the 0 438 29
statement 0 438 29
was 0 438 29
unsatisfactory 0 438 29
to 0 438 29
them. 0 438 29

Shadi 0 438 30
Hamid 0 438 30
of 0 438 30
the 0 438 30
Qatar-funded 0 438 30
Brookings 0 438 30
Institution 0 438 30
declared: 0 438 30
“Trump 1 438 30
has 1 438 30
so 1 438 30
rarely 1 438 30
recognized 1 438 30
that 1 438 30
American 1 438 30
Muslims 1 438 30
even 1 438 30
exist, 1 438 30
but 1 438 30
this 1 438 30
offers 1 438 30
apparent 1 438 30
proof 1 438 30
that 1 438 30
he 1 438 30
is 1 438 30
aware 1 438 30
of 1 438 30
our 1 438 30
existence. 1 438 30

Great! 1 438 31

Putting 0 438 32
all 0 438 32
that 0 438 32
context 0 438 32
aside, 0 438 32
it’s 0 438 32
offensive 0 438 32
and 0 438 32
pretty 1 438 32
much 1 438 32
terrible.” 1 438 32

Why? 0 438 33

Because 0 438 34
Trump 0 438 34
had 0 438 34
the 0 438 34
temerity 0 438 34
to 0 438 34
mention 0 438 34
jihad 0 438 34
terrorism. 0 438 34

Hamid 0 438 35
continued: 0 438 35
“We, 0 438 35
as 0 438 35
American 0 438 35
Muslims, 0 438 35
shouldn’t 0 438 35
be 0 438 35
defined 0 438 35
solely 0 438 35
in 0 438 35
our 0 438 35
relationship 0 438 35
to 0 438 35
bad 0 438 35
things 0 438 35
that 0 438 35
we 0 438 35
have 0 438 35
nothing 0 438 35
to 0 438 35
do 0 438 35
with. 0 438 35

We’re 0 438 36
also 0 438 36
normal 0 438 36
people 0 438 36
who 0 438 36
happen 0 438 36
to 0 438 36
be 0 438 36
Muslim 0 438 36
and 0 438 36
to 0 438 36
see 0 438 36
us 0 438 36
and 0 438 36
our 0 438 36
history 0 438 36
in 0 438 36
America 0 438 36
so 0 438 36
narrowly 0 438 36
is 0 438 36
plain 1 438 36
out 1 438 36
offensive.” 1 438 36

What 1 438 37
is 1 438 37
actually 1 438 37
offensive 1 438 37
is 1 438 37
that 1 438 37
Hamid 1 438 37
would 1 438 37
try 1 438 37
in 1 438 37
this 1 438 37
way 1 438 37
to 1 438 37
absolve 1 438 37
the 1 438 37
Muslim 1 438 37
community 1 438 37
of 1 438 37
any 1 438 37
responsibility 1 438 37
to 1 438 37
root 1 438 37
out 1 438 37
jihad 1 438 37
terrorist 1 438 37
from 1 438 37
its 1 438 37
midst. 1 438 37

There 0 438 38
is 0 438 38
certain 0 438 38
to 0 438 38
be 0 438 38
more 0 438 38
jihad 0 438 38
terrorism 0 438 38
during 0 438 38
this 0 438 38
Ramadan, 0 438 38
and 0 438 38
some 0 438 38
of 0 438 38
it 0 438 38
may 0 438 38
be 0 438 38
committed 0 438 38
by 0 438 38
Muslims 0 438 38
in 0 438 38
the 0 438 38
U.S. 0 438 38
Hamid, 1 438 38
if 1 438 38
he 1 438 38
cared 1 438 38
about 1 438 38
this, 1 438 38
would 1 438 38
be 1 438 38
confronting 1 438 38
honestly 1 438 38
the 1 438 38
teachings 1 438 38
of 1 438 38
Islam 1 438 38
that 1 438 38
make 1 438 38
Ramadan 1 438 38
the 1 438 38
month 1 438 38
of 1 438 38
jihad, 1 438 38
and 1 438 38
working 1 438 38
to 1 438 38
reform 1 438 38
them. 1 438 38

Meanwhile, 0 438 39
it 1 438 39
would 1 438 39
be 1 438 39
dangerous, 1 438 39
suicidal 1 438 39
folly 1 438 39
for 1 438 39
Infidels 1 438 39
to 1 438 39
pretend 1 438 39
that 1 438 39
Ramadan 1 438 39
is 1 438 39
not 1 438 39
the 1 438 39
month 1 438 39
of 1 438 39
jihad. 1 438 39

And 1 438 40
as 1 438 40
our 1 438 40
Ramadan 1 438 40
willful 1 438 40
blindness 1 438 40
continues, 1 438 40
more 1 438 40
Infidels 1 438 40
will 1 438 40
die. 1 438 40
