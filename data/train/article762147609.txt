“Companies 1

Mandelker, 0
Treasury 0

to 0
harden 0
their 0
financial 0
systems 0
against 0
“deceptive” 0
Iranian 0
transactions 0
that 0

The 0

“uses 0

moving 0
ahead 0
with 0

to 0

the 0

by 0

to 0
Mr. 1
Trump’s 1
pullout 0
from 0
the 0

Iranian 0
officials 0

the 0
increase, 0
while 0
provocative, 0
does 0
not 0
violate 0
its 0
commitments 0
under 0
the 0
nuclear 0
accord. 0

The 0
president 0
sent 0
shock 1
waves 0
around 0
the 0
world 0
with 0
his 0
May 0
8 0
decision 0
to 0
withdraw 0
from 0
the 0
Iran 0
nuclear 0
pact 0
and 0
begin 0
reimposing 0
U.S. 0
sanctions, 0
which 0
the 0
U.S., 0
Europe, 0
China 0
and 0
Russia 0
had 0
collectively 0
lifted 0
in 0
2015 0

Iran’s 0
promise 0
to 0
curb 0
its 0
suspect 0
nuclear 0
programs 0
and 0
allow 0
international 0
inspections. 0

While 0
Iran 0
told 0
the 0
U.N. 0
nuclear 0
watchdog 0
agency 0
on 0
Tuesday 0
that 0
it 0
plans 0
only 0
to 0
increase 0
enrichment 0
within 0
limits 0

the 0

from 0
a 0
top 0
Iranian 0
official 0
that 0
the 0
activities 1
could 1
be 1
quickly 1
expanded. 1

The 0
warning 0
put 0
fresh 0
pressure 0
on 0
European 0
leaders 0
to 0
keep 0
the 0
nuclear 0
accord 0
alive 0
despite 0
Mr. 1

The 0
head 0
of 0
Iran’s 0
nuclear 0
agency, 0
Ali 0
Akbar 0
Salehi, 0
said 0
Tehran 0
is 0
prepared 0
to 0
dramatically 1
increase 0
its 0
capacity 0
for 0
enrichment 0
but 0
that 0
the 0
work 0
so 0
far 0
is 0
limited 0
to 0
building 0
a 0
facility 0
for 0
assembling 0
the 0
centrifuges. 0

a 0

Iran’s 0
supreme 0
leader, 0
Ayatollah 0
Ali 0

ordered 0
the 0
increase 0
in 0
capacity 0

that 0

out 0

findings 0
Wednesday. 0

Under 0
terms 0
of 0
the 0

Iran 0
was 0
given 0
the 0
right 0
to 0
reclaim 0
billions 0
of 0
dollars 0
in 0
state 0
assets 0
and 0
bank 0
accounts 0
frozen 0

The 0

included 0
any 0
“intermediary” 0
transactions 0
by 0
U.S. 0
banks 0
to 0
convert 0
currency 0

Iran 0

elevated 0
the 0

of 0
the 0

Tehran 0
to 0
more 0
easily 0
move 0

On 0
the 0
day 0
the 0
nuclear 0
deal 0
was 0
implemented 0
in 0
2015, 0
Tehran 0
had 0
some 0
$5.7 0
billion 0
worth 0
of 0
assets 0
at 0
Bank 0
Muscat 0
in 0
Muscat, 0
Oman, 0
according 0
to 0
Senate 0
investigators, 0
who 0
said 0
Tehran 0
moved 0
quickly 0
to 0
request 0
access 0
to 0
the 0
U.S. 0
dollar. 0

On 0
Tehran’s 0
request, 0
Bank 0
Muscat 0
contacted 0
the 0
U.S. 0
Treasury 0
Department’s 0
office 0
of 0
foreign 0
assets 0
control. 0

According 0
to 0
the 0
Senate 0
report: 0
“Muscat 0
sought 0
to 0
convert 0
$5.7 0
billion 0
in 0
Omai 0
rials 0
into 0
euros. 0

[But] 0
because 0
the 0
rial 0
is 0
pegged 0
to 0
the 0
U.S. 0
dollar, 0
the 0
most 0
efficient 0
conversion 0
was 0
with 0
an 0
intermediary 0
step 0
through 0
a 0
U.S. 0
bank 0
using 0
U.S. 0
dollars.” 0

Obama 0
Treasury 0
Secretary 0
Jack 0
Lew 0
told 0
the 0
Senate 0
Foreign 0
Relations 0
Committee 0
in 0
July 0
2015 0
that 0
Iran 0
would 0
“continue 0
to 0
be 0
denied 0
access 0
to 0
the 0
[U.S.] 0
financial 0
and 0
commercial 0
market” 0
under 0
the 0
proposed 0
accord, 0
but 0
the 0
Treasury 0
office 0
went 0
ahead 0
with 0
attempts 0
to 0
quietly 0
allow 0
the 0
currency 0
transaction 0
sought 0
by 0
Iran. 0

“On 0
February 0
24, 0
2016, 0
OFAC 0
issued 0
a 0
specific 0
license 0
to 0
Bank 0
Muscat 0
authorizing 0
Iranian 0
assets 0
worth 0
roughly 0
$5.7 0
billion 0
to 0
flow 0
through 0
the 0
U.S. 0
financial 0
system,” 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
Senate 0
report, 0
which 0
claims 0
the 0
move 0
was 0
made 0
“even 0
though 0
U.S. 0
sanctions 0
prohibited 0
it.” 0

Even 0
as 0
office 0
of 0
foreign 0
assets 0
control 0
officials 0
directly 0
“encouraged 0
two 0
U.S. 0
correspondent 0
banks 0
to 0
convert 0
the 0
funds,” 0
the 0
Treasury 0
Department 0
continued 0
to 0
deny 0
it 0
was 0
working 0
to 0
facilitate 0
the 0
currency 0
transaction, 0
said 0
the 0
report, 0
which 0
cites 0
a 0
2016 0
letter 0
from 0
the 0
department 0
to 0
Sen. 0
Marco 0
Rubio, 0
Florida 0
Republican, 0
and 0
Sen. 0
Mark 0
Kirk, 0
Illinois 0
Republican, 0
that 0
contended 0
the 0
Obama 0
“administration 0
has 0
not 0
been 0
and 0
is 0
not 0
planning 0
to 0
grant 0
Iran 0
access 0
to 0
the 0
U.S. 0
financial 0
system.” 0

The 0
catch, 0
according 0
to 0
Senate 0
investigators, 0
was 0
that 0
neither 0
of 0
the 0
U.S. 0
banks 0
approached 0
by 0
the 0
office 0
of 0
foreign 0
assets 0
control 0
would 0
take 0
on 0
the 0
Iranian 0
currency 0
exchange 0
— 0
in 0
part 0
because 0
of 0
political 0
concerns 0
over 0
the 0
prospect 0
of 0
being 0
found 0
out 0
to 0
have 0
secretly 0
circumvented 0
the 0
remaining 0
ban 0
on 0
U.S. 0
transactions 0
with 0
the 0
Islamic 0
republic. 0

Despite 0
the 0
Obama 0
administration’s 0
efforts, 0
Iran 0
was 0
ultimately 0
forced 0
to 0
convert 0
its 0
Bank 0
Muscat 0
assets 0
to 0
euros 0
in 0
small 0
increments 0
using 0
European 0
banks 0
and 0
without 0
accessing 0
the 0
U.S. 0
financial 0
system, 0
the 0
Senate 0
investigators 0
said. 0

Mr. 0
Portman 0
said 0
in 0
a 0
statement 0
Tuesday 0
night 0
that 0
“the 0
Obama 0
administration 0
misled 0
the 1
American 1
people 1
and 0
Congress 0
because 0
they 0
were 0
desperate 0
to 0
get 0
a 0
deal 0
with 0
Iran.” 0

“Despite 0
claims 0
both 0
before 0
and 0
after 0
the 0
Iran 0
deal 0
was 0
completed 0
that 0
the 0
U.S. 0
financial 0
system 0
would 0
remain 0
off 0
limits, 0
the 0
Obama 0
administration 0
issued 0
a 0
specific 0
license 0
allowing 0
Iran 0
to 0
convert 0
billions 0
of 0
dollars 0
in 0
assets 0
using 0
the 0
U.S. 0
financial 0
system,” 0
Mr. 0
Portman 0
said. 0

“The 0
only 0
reason 0
this 0
transaction 0
wasn’t 0
executed 0
was 0
because 0
two 0
U.S. 0
banks 0
refused, 0
even 0
though 0
the 0
administration 0
asked 0
them 0
to 0
help 0
convert 0
the 0
money.” 0

Such 0
sanctions, 0
he 0
added, 0
“are 0
a 0
vital 0
foreign 0
policy 0
tool, 0
and 0
the 0
U.S. 0
government 0
should 0
never 0
work 0
to 0
actively 0
undermine 0
their 0
enforcement 0
or 0
effectiveness.” 0
