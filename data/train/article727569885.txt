Donald 0 132 1
Trump 0 132 1
represented 0 132 1
a 0 132 1
refreshing 0 132 1
break 0 132 1
from 0 132 1
the 0 132 1
eight 0 132 1
years 0 132 1
of 0 132 1
pusillanimous 1 132 1
foreign 0 132 1
policies 0 132 1
pursued 0 132 1
by 0 132 1
past 0 132 1

Nowhere 0 132 2
was 0 132 2
this 0 132 2
more 0 132 2
evident 0 132 2
than 0 132 2
in 0 132 2
the 0 132 2
manner 0 132 2
in 0 132 2
which 0 132 2
Trump 0 132 2
described 0 132 2
Iran’s 0 132 2
repressive 0 132 2
regime 0 132 2
and 0 132 2
attempts 0 132 2
by 0 132 2
the 0 132 2
Iranian 0 132 2

to 0 132 2

through 0 132 2

When 0 132 3
it 0 132 3
comes 0 132 3
to 0 132 3
Iran’s 0 132 3
governing 0 132 3
authorities, 0 132 3
the 0 132 3
Trump 0 132 3
administration 0 132 3
is 0 132 3
under 0 132 3
no 0 132 3
illusions 0 132 3
about 0 132 3
the 1 132 3
nefarious 1 132 3
nature 1 132 3
of 1 132 3
this 1 132 3
fascist 1 132 3
theocracy. 1 132 3

“We 0 132 4
are 0 132 4
restoring 0 132 4
clarity 0 132 4
about 0 132 4
our 0 132 4
adversaries,” 0 132 4
Trump 0 132 4
stated 0 132 4
in 0 132 4
a 0 132 4
not 0 132 4
too 0 132 4
subtle 0 132 4
jibe 0 132 4
at 0 132 4
his 0 132 4
predecessor 0 132 4
who 0 132 4
seemed 0 132 4
to 0 132 4
be 0 132 4
in 0 132 4
a 0 132 4
perpetual 0 132 4
state 0 132 4
of 0 132 4
confusion 0 132 4
about 0 132 4
who 0 132 4
his 0 132 4
friends 0 132 4
and 0 132 4
enemies 0 132 4
were. 0 132 4

Trump 0 132 5
also 0 132 5
referenced 0 132 5
the 0 132 5
recent 0 132 5
widespread 0 132 5
Iranian 0 132 5
protests, 0 132 5
crushed 0 132 5
with 0 132 5
extreme 0 132 5
ruthlessness 0 132 5
by 0 132 5
the 0 132 5
Iranian 0 132 5
Revolutionary 0 132 5
Guard 0 132 5
Corps 0 132 5
and 0 132 5
its 0 132 5
Basij 0 132 5

“When 0 132 6
the 0 132 6
people 0 132 6
of 0 132 6
Iran 0 132 6
rose 0 132 6
up 0 132 6
against 0 132 6
the 0 132 6
crimes 0 132 6
of 0 132 6
a 0 132 6
corrupt 0 132 6
dictatorship,” 0 132 6
he 0 132 6
stated, 0 132 6
“I 0 132 6
did 0 132 6
not 0 132 6
stay 0 132 6
silent. 0 132 6

America 1 132 7
stands 1 132 7
with 1 132 7

in 1 132 7
their 1 132 7

for 1 132 7

By 0 132 8
contrast, 0 132 8
Barack 0 132 8
Obama 0 132 8
and 0 132 8
his 0 132 8
obsequious 1 132 8
acolytes 1 132 8
were 0 132 8
besotted 0 132 8
by 0 132 8
the 0 132 8
prospect 0 132 8
of 0 132 8
forging 0 132 8
détente 0 132 8
with 0 132 8
the 0 132 8
despotic 1 132 8
mullahs 1 132 8
of 0 132 8
the 0 132 8
Islamic 0 132 8
Republic. 0 132 8

His 0 132 9
administration 0 132 9
remained 0 132 9
largely 0 132 9
silent 0 132 9
when 0 132 9
Iranians 0 132 9
took 0 132 9
to 0 132 9
the 0 132 9
streets 0 132 9
in 0 132 9
2009 0 132 9
to 0 132 9
protest 0 132 9
a 0 132 9
rigged 0 132 9
election. 0 132 9

Some 0 132 10
have 0 132 10
speculated 0 132 10
that 0 132 10
his 0 132 10
administration 0 132 10
missed 0 132 10
out 0 132 10
on 0 132 10
a 0 132 10
prime 0 132 10
opportunity 0 132 10
for 0 132 10
regime 0 132 10
change. 0 132 10

It 0 132 11
was 0 132 11
only 0 132 11
downhill 0 132 11
from 0 132 11
there. 0 132 11

In 0 132 12
a 0 132 12
misguided 1 132 12
effort 1 132 12
to 0 132 12
secure 0 132 12
Iran’s 0 132 12
willingness 0 132 12
to 0 132 12

sold 1 132 12
everything 1 132 12
including 1 132 12
the 1 132 12

He 0 132 13
tried 0 132 13
selling 0 132 13
the 0 132 13
American 0 132 13
people 0 132 13
on 0 132 13
the 0 132 13
naïve 0 132 13
notion 0 132 13
that 0 132 13
there 0 132 13
were 0 132 13

of 0 132 13
import 0 132 13
in 0 132 13
the 0 132 13
Iranian 0 132 13
government, 0 132 13
ignoring 0 132 13
the 0 132 13
obvious 0 132 13
fact 0 132 13
that 0 132 13
all 0 132 13
authority 0 132 13
in 0 132 13
Iran 0 132 13
is 0 132 13

concept 0 132 14
of 0 132 14

is 0 132 24
only 0 132 24

On 0 132 25
the 0 132 25
contrary, 0 132 25
the 0 132 25
Iranians 0 132 25
correctly 0 132 25

Ironically, 0 132 31
the 0 132 31
seizure 0 132 31
occurred 0 132 31
on 0 132 31
the 0 132 31
very 0 132 31
day 0 132 31
that 0 132 31
Obama 0 132 31
was 0 132 31
to 0 132 31
give 0 132 31
his 0 132 31
State 0 132 31
of 0 132 31
the 0 132 31
Union 0 132 31
address 0 132 31
but 0 132 31
predictably, 0 132 31
he 1 132 31
didn’t 1 132 31
think 1 132 31
that 1 132 31
the 1 132 31
seizure 1 132 31
of 1 132 31
Americans 1 132 31
was 1 132 31
important 1 132 31
enough 1 132 31
to 1 132 31
note. 1 132 31

But 0 132 32
according 0 132 32
to 0 132 32
the 0 132 32
Navy, 0 132 32
the 0 132 32
past 0 132 32
five 0 132 32
months 0 132 32
have 0 132 32
witnessed 0 132 32
markedly 0 132 32
less 0 132 32
belligerent 0 132 32
conduct 0 132 32
from 0 132 32
the 0 132 32
Iranians, 0 132 32
leaving 0 132 32
Navy 0 132 32
officials 0 132 32
baffled 0 132 32
by 0 132 32
the 0 132 32
sudden 0 132 32
positive 0 132 32
change 0 132 32
in 0 132 32
attitude. 0 132 32

In 0 132 33
fact, 0 132 33
Iran’s 0 132 33
attitude 0 132 33
adjustment 0 132 33
in 0 132 33
the 0 132 33
Arabian 0 132 33
Gulf 0 132 33
is 0 132 33
no 0 132 33
mystery 0 132 33
and 0 132 33
stems 0 132 33
from 0 132 33
the 0 132 33
Trump 0 132 33
administration’s 0 132 33
implementation 0 132 33
of 0 132 33
a 0 132 33
new 0 132 33
robust 0 132 33
foreign 0 132 33
policy 0 132 33
vis-à-vis 0 132 33
the 0 132 33
Islamic 0 132 33
Republic. 0 132 33

Soon 0 132 34
after 0 132 34
taking 0 132 34
office, 0 132 34
Trump 0 132 34
noted 0 132 34
that 0 132 34
“Iran 0 132 34
[was] 0 132 34
playing 0 132 34
with 0 132 34
fire” 0 132 34
and 0 132 34
added 0 132 34
that 0 132 34
he 0 132 34
wouldn’t 0 132 34
be 0 132 34
as 0 132 34
“kind” 0 132 34
to 0 132 34
the 0 132 34
mullahs 0 132 34
as 0 132 34
Obama 0 132 34
was. 0 132 34

This 0 132 35
wasn’t 0 132 35
empty 1 132 35
rhetoric. 1 132 35

It 0 132 36
was 0 132 36
backed 0 132 36
up 0 132 36
by 0 132 36
tangible 0 132 36
action. 0 132 36

Additional 0 132 37
sanctions 0 132 37
were 0 132 37
imposed 0 132 37
against 0 132 37
Iran 0 132 37
for 0 132 37
acting 0 132 37
in 0 132 37
defiance 0 132 37
of 0 132 37
UNSCR 0 132 37
2231. 0 132 37

Sanctions 0 132 38
were 0 132 38
also 0 132 38
imposed 0 132 38
against 0 132 38
the 0 132 38
IRGC 0 132 38
for 0 132 38
supporting 0 132 38
terrorism. 0 132 38

Trump’s 0 132 39
DOJ 0 132 39
revived 0 132 39
and 0 132 39
breathed 0 132 39
new 0 132 39
life 0 132 39
into 0 132 39
Project 0 132 39
Cassandra, 0 132 39
a 0 132 39
promising 0 132 39
anti-Hezbollah/IRGC 0 132 39
law 0 132 39
enforcement 0 132 39
initiative 0 132 39
shelved 0 132 39
by 0 132 39
Obama. 0 132 39

Most 0 132 40
importantly, 0 132 40
Trump 0 132 40
failed 0 132 40
to 0 132 40
certify 0 132 40
the 0 132 40
JCPOA 0 132 40
noting 0 132 40
material 0 132 40
Iranian 0 132 40
breaches, 0 132 40
and 0 132 40
has 0 132 40
threatened 0 132 40
to 0 132 40
abrogate 0 132 40
the 0 132 40
deal 0 132 40
in 0 132 40
its 0 132 40
entirety 0 132 40
unless 0 132 40
modifications 0 132 40
are 0 132 40
implemented. 0 132 40

Those 0 132 41
modifications 0 132 41
would 0 132 41
include 0 132 41
an 0 132 41
end 0 132 41
to 0 132 41
absurd 0 132 41
sunset 0 132 41
clauses 0 132 41
in 0 132 41
the 0 132 41
JCPOA 0 132 41
and 0 132 41
tough 0 132 41
restrictions 0 132 41
on 0 132 41
ballistic 0 132 41
missile 0 132 41
testing. 0 132 41

The 0 132 41

mullahs 0 132 41

have 0 132 41

become 0 132 41

cognizant 0 132 41

of 0 132 41

the 0 132 41

fact 0 132 41

that 0 132 41

there’s 0 132 41

a 1 132 41

new 1 132 41

sheriff 1 132 41

in 1 132 41

town, 1 132 41

one 0 132 41

that 0 132 41

backs 0 132 41

up 0 132 41

tough 0 132 41

talk 0 132 41

with 0 132 41

action 0 132 41

and 0 132 41

doesn’t 1 132 41

ask 1 132 41

“how 1 132 41

high” 1 132 41

when 1 132 41

they 1 132 41

say 1 132 41

“jump.” 1 132 41

Clearly, 1 132 41

the 0 132 41

IRGC’s 0 132 41

new 0 132 41

docile 1 132 41

posture 1 132 41

in 0 132 41

the 0 132 41

Arabian 0 132 41

Gulf 0 132 41

is 0 132 41

a 0 132 41

direct 0 132 41

consequence 0 132 41

of 0 132 41

this 0 132 41

realization. 0 132 41
