Yesterday’s 0
State 0
of 0
the 0
Union 0
address 0
issued 0
by 0
Donald 0
Trump 0
represented 0
a 0
refreshing 0
break 0
from 0
the 0
eight 0
years 0
of 0
pusillanimous 1
foreign 0
policies 0
pursued 0
by 0
past 0
administration. 0

Nowhere 0
was 0
this 0
more 0
evident 0
than 0
in 0
the 0
manner 0
in 0
which 0
Trump 0
described 0
Iran’s 0
repressive 0
regime 0
and 0
attempts 0
by 0
the 0
Iranian 0
people 0
to 0
overthrow 0
it 0
through 0
peaceful 0
protest. 0

When 0
it 0
comes 0
to 0
Iran’s 0
governing 0
authorities, 0
the 0
Trump 0
administration 0
is 0
under 0
no 0
illusions 0
about 0
the 1
nefarious 1
nature 1
of 1
this 1
fascist 1
theocracy. 1

“We 0
are 0
restoring 0
clarity 0
about 0
our 0
adversaries,” 0
Trump 0
stated 0
in 0
a 0
not 0
too 0
subtle 0
jibe 0
at 0
his 0
predecessor 0
who 0
seemed 0
to 0
be 0
in 0
a 0
perpetual 0
state 0
of 0
confusion 0
about 0
who 0
his 0
friends 0
and 0
enemies 0
were. 0

Trump 0
also 0
referenced 0
the 0
recent 0
widespread 0
Iranian 0
protests, 0
crushed 0
with 0
extreme 0
ruthlessness 0
by 0
the 0
Iranian 0
Revolutionary 0
Guard 0
Corps 0
and 0
its 0
Basij 0
auxiliary 0
militia. 0

“When 0
the 0
people 0
of 0
Iran 0
rose 0
up 0
against 0
the 0
crimes 0
of 0
a 0
corrupt 0
dictatorship,” 0
he 0
stated, 0
“I 0
did 0
not 0
stay 0
silent. 0

America 1
stands 1
with 1
the 1
people 1
of 1
Iran 1
in 1
their 1
courageous 1
struggle 1
for 1
freedom.” 1

By 0
contrast, 0
Barack 0
Obama 0
and 0
his 0
obsequious 1
acolytes 1
were 0
besotted 0
by 0
the 0
prospect 0
of 0
forging 0
détente 0
with 0
the 0
despotic 1
mullahs 1
of 0
the 0
Islamic 0
Republic. 0

His 0
administration 0
remained 0
largely 0
silent 0
when 0
Iranians 0
took 0
to 0
the 0
streets 0
in 0
2009 0
to 0
protest 0
a 0
rigged 0
election. 0

Some 0
have 0
speculated 0
that 0
his 0
administration 0
missed 0
out 0
on 0
a 0
prime 0
opportunity 0
for 0
regime 0
change. 0

It 0
was 0
only 0
downhill 0
from 0
there. 0

In 0
a 0
misguided 1
effort 1
to 0
secure 0
Iran’s 0
willingness 0
to 0
sign 0
the 0
Joint 0
Comprehensive 0
Plan 0
of 0
Action, 0
Obama 1
sold 1
everything 1
including 1
the 1
kitchen 1
sink. 1

He 0
tried 0
selling 0
the 0
American 0
people 0
on 0
the 0
naïve 0
notion 0
that 0
there 0
were 0
moderate 0
elements 0
of 0
import 0
in 0
the 0
Iranian 0
government, 0
ignoring 0
the 0
obvious 0
fact 0
that 0
all 0
authority 0
in 0
Iran 0
is 0
vested 0
with 0
the 0
Supreme 0
Leader, 0
Ayatollah 0
Khamenei, 0
and 0
his 0
IRGC 0
henchmen. 0

The 0
tried 0
and 0
true 0
concept 0
of 0
peace 0
through 0
strength 0
gave 0
way 0
to 0
fecklessness 1
through 1
appeasement. 1

Ransom 0
payments 0
to 0
the 0
tune 0
of 0
$1.7 0
billion 0
were 0
transferred 0
to 0
Iran. 0

Promising 0
criminal 0
investigations 0
targeting 0
Iran’s 0
chief 0
terror 0
proxy, 0
Hezbollah, 0
were 0
shut 0
down. 0

Targeted 0
liquidation 0
operations 0
by 0
our 0
Israeli 0
allies 0
against 0
Iranian 0
Quds 0
Force 0
leaders 0
were 0
foiled 0
after 0
Obama 0
tipped 0
off 0
Tehran 0
on 0
Israel’s 0
intentions. 0

Iranian 0
material 0
breaches 0
of 0
the 0
JCPOA 0
were 0
all 0
but 0
ignored 0
while 0
Iran’s 0
ballistic 0
missile 0
program 0
was 0
allowed 0
to 0
proceed 0
at 0
full 0
speed 0
despite 0
being 0
in 0
defiance 0
of 0
United 0
Nations 0
Security 0
Council 0
resolution 0
2231. 0

Obama’s 0
near 0
messianic 1
zealotry 1
in 0
his 0
interactions 0
with 0
the 0
mullahs 0
severely 0
compromised 0
America’s 0
national 0
security 0
and 0
weakened 0
its 0
image 0
on 0
the 0
international 0
stage. 0

Worse, 0
it 0
emboldened 0
the 0
mullahs 0
(appeasement 0
tends 0
to 0
do 0
that) 0
who 0
seemed 0
to 0
revel 0
in 0
Obama’s 1
groveling. 1

Iran’s 0
mischief-making 1
extends 0
far 0
and 0
wide 0
but 0
it 0
is 0
in 0
the 0
Arabian 0
Gulf 0
where 0
friction 0
between 0
the 0
IRGC 0
and 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
Navy 0
remains 0
constant. 0

Iran 0
regards 0
the 0
Arabian 0
Gulf 0
as 0
its 0
domain 0
and 0
but 0
for 0
the 0
presence 0
of 0
the 0
U.S. 0
5th 0
Fleet, 0
would 0
have 0
full 0
reign 0
over 0
its 0
waters, 0
which 0
include 0
the 0
strategic 0
Strait 0
of 0
Hormuz. 0

In 0
addition 0
to 0
securing 0
the 0
Gulf, 0
the 0
5th 0
Fleet 0
serves 0
as 0
a 0
constant 0
reminder 0
to 0
the 0
Iranians 0
of 0
their 0
impotence. 0

But 0
the 0
deterrent 1
effect 1
of 0
the 0
Navy’s 0
5th 0
Fleet, 0
and 0
for 0
that 0
matter 0
America’s 0
military 0
might, 0
is 0
only 0
as 0
effective 0
as 0
the 0
political 0
leadership 0
that 0
commands 0
it, 0
and 0
Barack 0
Obama 0
as 0
Commander 0
in 0
Chief 0
of 0
the 0
armed 0
forces 0
did 0
little 0
to 0
instill 0
fear 0
or 0
project 0
deterrence. 0

On 0
the 0
contrary, 0
the 0
Iranians 0
correctly 0
viewed 0
him 0
as 0
weak, 1
indecisive 1
and 1
ineffectual. 1

On 0
his 0
watch, 0
American 0
warships 0
patrolling 0
the 0
Gulf 0
were 0
harried 0
by 0
armed 0
IRGC 0
speed 0
boats 0
and 0
larger 0
navy 0
frigates 0
with 0
near 0
impunity. 0

At 0
times 0
Iranian 0
naval 0
vessels 0
closed 0
to 0
within 0
600 0
to 0
150 0
yards 0
of 0
American 0
warships. 0

The 0
navy 0
termed 0
these 0
near 0
ritualistic, 1
belligerent 1
encounters, 1
“unsafe 0
and 0
unprofessional.” 0

Iranian 0
arrogance 0
and 0
impudence 0
reached 0
its 0
zenith 0
with 0
the 0
January 0
12th 0
2016 0
seizure 0
of 0
two 0
American 0
riverine 0
command 0
boats 0
and 0
their 0
crews 0
near 0
Farsi 0
Island. 0

The 0
RCBs 0
and 0
crews 0
manning 0
them 0
were 0
returned 0
some 0
16 0
hours 0
later 0
but 0
not 0
before 0
the 0
Iranians 0
stole 0
two 0
satellite 0
phone 0
sim 0
cards, 0
likely 0
containing 0
classified 0
information, 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
thousands 0
of 0
pages 0
of 0
information 0
downloaded 0
from 0
laptops, 0
GPS 0
devices 0
and 0
maps 0
used 0
by 0
the 0
sailors. 0

Ironically, 0
the 0
seizure 0
occurred 0
on 0
the 0
very 0
day 0
that 0
Obama 0
was 0
to 0
give 0
his 0
State 0
of 0
the 0
Union 0
address 0
but 0
predictably, 0
he 1
didn’t 1
think 1
that 1
the 1
seizure 1
of 1
Americans 1
was 1
important 1
enough 1
to 1
note. 1

But 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
Navy, 0
the 0
past 0
five 0
months 0
have 0
witnessed 0
markedly 0
less 0
belligerent 0
conduct 0
from 0
the 0
Iranians, 0
leaving 0
Navy 0
officials 0
baffled 0
by 0
the 0
sudden 0
positive 0
change 0
in 0
attitude. 0

In 0
fact, 0
Iran’s 0
attitude 0
adjustment 0
in 0
the 0
Arabian 0
Gulf 0
is 0
no 0
mystery 0
and 0
stems 0
from 0
the 0
Trump 0
administration’s 0
implementation 0
of 0
a 0
new 0
robust 0
foreign 0
policy 0
vis-à-vis 0
the 0
Islamic 0
Republic. 0

Soon 0
after 0
taking 0
office, 0
Trump 0
noted 0
that 0
“Iran 0
[was] 0
playing 0
with 0
fire” 0
and 0
added 0
that 0
he 0
wouldn’t 0
be 0
as 0
“kind” 0
to 0
the 0
mullahs 0
as 0
Obama 0
was. 0

This 0
wasn’t 0
empty 1
rhetoric. 1

It 0
was 0
backed 0
up 0
by 0
tangible 0
action. 0

Additional 0
sanctions 0
were 0
imposed 0
against 0
Iran 0
for 0
acting 0
in 0
defiance 0
of 0
UNSCR 0
2231. 0

Sanctions 0
were 0
also 0
imposed 0
against 0
the 0
IRGC 0
for 0
supporting 0
terrorism. 0

Trump’s 0
DOJ 0
revived 0
and 0
breathed 0
new 0
life 0
into 0
Project 0
Cassandra, 0
a 0
promising 0
anti-Hezbollah/IRGC 0
law 0
enforcement 0
initiative 0
shelved 0
by 0
Obama. 0

Most 0
importantly, 0
Trump 0
failed 0
to 0
certify 0
the 0
JCPOA 0
noting 0
material 0
Iranian 0
breaches, 0
and 0
has 0
threatened 0
to 0
abrogate 0
the 0
deal 0
in 0
its 0
entirety 0
unless 0
modifications 0
are 0
implemented. 0

Those 0
modifications 0
would 0
include 0
an 0
end 0
to 0
absurd 0
sunset 0
clauses 0
in 0
the 0
JCPOA 0
and 0
tough 0
restrictions 0
on 0
ballistic 0
missile 0
testing. 0

The 0
mullahs 0
have 0
become 0
cognizant 0
of 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
there’s 0
a 1
new 1
sheriff 1
in 1
town, 1
one 0
that 0
backs 0
up 0
tough 0
talk 0
with 0
action 0
and 0
doesn’t 1
ask 1
“how 1
high” 1
when 1
they 1
say 1
“jump.” 1
Clearly, 1
the 0
IRGC’s 0
new 0
docile 1
posture 1
in 0
the 0
Arabian 0
Gulf 0
is 0
a 0
direct 0
consequence 0
of 0
this 0
realization. 0
