Donald 0 101 1
Trump 0 101 1
represented 0 101 1
a 0 101 1
refreshing 0 101 1
break 0 101 1
from 0 101 1
the 0 101 1
eight 0 101 1
years 0 101 1
of 0 101 1
pusillanimous 1 101 1
foreign 0 101 1
policies 0 101 1
pursued 0 101 1
by 0 101 1
past 0 101 1
administration. 0 101 1

Nowhere 0 101 2
was 0 101 2
this 0 101 2
more 0 101 2
evident 0 101 2
than 0 101 2
in 0 101 2
the 0 101 2
manner 0 101 2
in 0 101 2
which 0 101 2
Trump 0 101 2
described 0 101 2
Iran’s 0 101 2
repressive 0 101 2
regime 0 101 2
and 0 101 2
attempts 0 101 2
by 0 101 2
the 0 101 2
Iranian 0 101 2
people 0 101 2
to 0 101 2

through 0 101 2
peaceful 0 101 2

When 0 101 3
it 0 101 3
comes 0 101 3
to 0 101 3
Iran’s 0 101 3
governing 0 101 3
authorities, 0 101 3
the 0 101 3
Trump 0 101 3
administration 0 101 3
is 0 101 3
under 0 101 3
no 0 101 3
illusions 0 101 3
about 0 101 3
the 1 101 3
nefarious 1 101 3
nature 1 101 3
of 1 101 3
this 1 101 3
fascist 1 101 3
theocracy. 1 101 3

“We 0 101 4
are 0 101 4
restoring 0 101 4
clarity 0 101 4
about 0 101 4
our 0 101 4
adversaries,” 0 101 4
Trump 0 101 4
stated 0 101 4
in 0 101 4
a 0 101 4
not 0 101 4
too 0 101 4
subtle 0 101 4
jibe 0 101 4
at 0 101 4
his 0 101 4
predecessor 0 101 4
who 0 101 4
seemed 0 101 4
to 0 101 4
be 0 101 4
in 0 101 4
a 0 101 4
perpetual 0 101 4
state 0 101 4
of 0 101 4
confusion 0 101 4
about 0 101 4
who 0 101 4
his 0 101 4
friends 0 101 4
and 0 101 4
enemies 0 101 4
were. 0 101 4

Trump 0 101 5
also 0 101 5
referenced 0 101 5
the 0 101 5
recent 0 101 5
widespread 0 101 5
Iranian 0 101 5
protests, 0 101 5
crushed 0 101 5
with 0 101 5
extreme 0 101 5
ruthlessness 0 101 5
by 0 101 5
the 0 101 5
Iranian 0 101 5
Revolutionary 0 101 5
Guard 0 101 5
Corps 0 101 5
and 0 101 5
its 0 101 5
Basij 0 101 5

militia. 0 101 5

“When 0 101 6
the 0 101 6
people 0 101 6
of 0 101 6
Iran 0 101 6
rose 0 101 6
up 0 101 6
against 0 101 6
the 0 101 6
crimes 0 101 6
of 0 101 6
a 0 101 6
corrupt 0 101 6
dictatorship,” 0 101 6
he 0 101 6
stated, 0 101 6
“I 0 101 6
did 0 101 6
not 0 101 6
stay 0 101 6
silent. 0 101 6

America 1 101 7
stands 1 101 7
with 1 101 7

in 1 101 7
their 1 101 7
courageous 1 101 7

for 1 101 7
freedom.” 1 101 7

By 0 101 8
contrast, 0 101 8
Barack 0 101 8
Obama 0 101 8
and 0 101 8
his 0 101 8
obsequious 1 101 8
acolytes 1 101 8
were 0 101 8
besotted 0 101 8
by 0 101 8
the 0 101 8
prospect 0 101 8
of 0 101 8
forging 0 101 8
détente 0 101 8
with 0 101 8
the 0 101 8
despotic 1 101 8
mullahs 1 101 8
of 0 101 8
the 0 101 8
Islamic 0 101 8
Republic. 0 101 8

His 0 101 9
administration 0 101 9
remained 0 101 9
largely 0 101 9
silent 0 101 9
when 0 101 9
Iranians 0 101 9
took 0 101 9
to 0 101 9
the 0 101 9
streets 0 101 9
in 0 101 9
2009 0 101 9
to 0 101 9
protest 0 101 9
a 0 101 9
rigged 0 101 9
election. 0 101 9

Some 0 101 10
have 0 101 10
speculated 0 101 10
that 0 101 10
his 0 101 10
administration 0 101 10
missed 0 101 10
out 0 101 10
on 0 101 10
a 0 101 10
prime 0 101 10
opportunity 0 101 10
for 0 101 10
regime 0 101 10

It 0 101 11
was 0 101 11
only 0 101 11
downhill 0 101 11
from 0 101 11
there. 0 101 11

In 0 101 12
a 0 101 12
misguided 1 101 12
effort 1 101 12
to 0 101 12
secure 0 101 12
Iran’s 0 101 12

everything 1 101 12
including 1 101 12
the 1 101 12

He 0 101 13
tried 0 101 13
selling 0 101 13
the 0 101 13
American 0 101 13
people 0 101 13
on 0 101 13

naïve 0 101 13
notion 0 101 13
that 0 101 13
there 0 101 13
were 0 101 13

of 0 101 13
import 0 101 13
in 0 101 13

Iranian 0 101 13
government, 0 101 13
ignoring 0 101 13
the 0 101 13
obvious 0 101 13
fact 0 101 13
that 0 101 13
all 0 101 13
authority 0 101 13
in 0 101 13
Iran 0 101 13
is 0 101 13

the 0 101 25
contrary, 0 101 25
the 0 101 25

Ironically, 0 101 31
the 0 101 31
seizure 0 101 31
occurred 0 101 31
on 0 101 31
the 0 101 31
very 0 101 31
day 0 101 31
that 0 101 31
Obama 0 101 31
was 0 101 31
to 0 101 31
give 0 101 31
his 0 101 31
State 0 101 31
of 0 101 31
the 0 101 31
Union 0 101 31
address 0 101 31
but 0 101 31
predictably, 0 101 31
he 1 101 31
didn’t 1 101 31
think 1 101 31
that 1 101 31
the 1 101 31
seizure 1 101 31
of 1 101 31
Americans 1 101 31
was 1 101 31
important 1 101 31
enough 1 101 31
to 1 101 31
note. 1 101 31

But 0 101 32
according 0 101 32
to 0 101 32
the 0 101 32
Navy, 0 101 32
the 0 101 32
past 0 101 32
five 0 101 32
months 0 101 32
have 0 101 32
witnessed 0 101 32
markedly 0 101 32
less 0 101 32
belligerent 0 101 32
conduct 0 101 32
from 0 101 32
the 0 101 32
Iranians, 0 101 32
leaving 0 101 32
Navy 0 101 32
officials 0 101 32
baffled 0 101 32
by 0 101 32
the 0 101 32
sudden 0 101 32
positive 0 101 32
change 0 101 32
in 0 101 32
attitude. 0 101 32

In 0 101 33
fact, 0 101 33
Iran’s 0 101 33
attitude 0 101 33
adjustment 0 101 33
in 0 101 33
the 0 101 33
Arabian 0 101 33
Gulf 0 101 33
is 0 101 33
no 0 101 33
mystery 0 101 33
and 0 101 33
stems 0 101 33
from 0 101 33
the 0 101 33
Trump 0 101 33
administration’s 0 101 33
implementation 0 101 33
of 0 101 33
a 0 101 33
new 0 101 33
robust 0 101 33
foreign 0 101 33
policy 0 101 33
vis-à-vis 0 101 33
the 0 101 33
Islamic 0 101 33
Republic. 0 101 33

Soon 0 101 34
after 0 101 34
taking 0 101 34
office, 0 101 34
Trump 0 101 34
noted 0 101 34
that 0 101 34
“Iran 0 101 34
[was] 0 101 34
playing 0 101 34
with 0 101 34
fire” 0 101 34
and 0 101 34
added 0 101 34
that 0 101 34
he 0 101 34
wouldn’t 0 101 34
be 0 101 34
as 0 101 34
“kind” 0 101 34
to 0 101 34
the 0 101 34
mullahs 0 101 34
as 0 101 34
Obama 0 101 34
was. 0 101 34

This 0 101 35
wasn’t 0 101 35
empty 1 101 35
rhetoric. 1 101 35

It 0 101 36
was 0 101 36
backed 0 101 36
up 0 101 36
by 0 101 36
tangible 0 101 36
action. 0 101 36

Additional 0 101 37
sanctions 0 101 37
were 0 101 37
imposed 0 101 37
against 0 101 37
Iran 0 101 37
for 0 101 37
acting 0 101 37
in 0 101 37
defiance 0 101 37
of 0 101 37
UNSCR 0 101 37
2231. 0 101 37

Sanctions 0 101 38
were 0 101 38
also 0 101 38
imposed 0 101 38
against 0 101 38
the 0 101 38
IRGC 0 101 38
for 0 101 38
supporting 0 101 38
terrorism. 0 101 38

Trump’s 0 101 39
DOJ 0 101 39
revived 0 101 39
and 0 101 39
breathed 0 101 39
new 0 101 39
life 0 101 39
into 0 101 39
Project 0 101 39
Cassandra, 0 101 39
a 0 101 39
promising 0 101 39
anti-Hezbollah/IRGC 0 101 39
law 0 101 39
enforcement 0 101 39
initiative 0 101 39
shelved 0 101 39
by 0 101 39
Obama. 0 101 39

Most 0 101 40
importantly, 0 101 40
Trump 0 101 40
failed 0 101 40
to 0 101 40
certify 0 101 40
the 0 101 40
JCPOA 0 101 40
noting 0 101 40
material 0 101 40
Iranian 0 101 40
breaches, 0 101 40
and 0 101 40
has 0 101 40
threatened 0 101 40
to 0 101 40
abrogate 0 101 40
the 0 101 40
deal 0 101 40
in 0 101 40
its 0 101 40
entirety 0 101 40
unless 0 101 40
modifications 0 101 40
are 0 101 40
implemented. 0 101 40

Those 0 101 41
modifications 0 101 41
would 0 101 41
include 0 101 41
an 0 101 41
end 0 101 41
to 0 101 41
absurd 0 101 41
sunset 0 101 41
clauses 0 101 41
in 0 101 41
the 0 101 41
JCPOA 0 101 41
and 0 101 41
tough 0 101 41
restrictions 0 101 41
on 0 101 41
ballistic 0 101 41
missile 0 101 41
testing. 0 101 41

The 0 101 42
mullahs 0 101 42
have 0 101 42
become 0 101 42
cognizant 0 101 42
of 0 101 42
the 0 101 42
fact 0 101 42
that 0 101 42
there’s 0 101 42
a 1 101 42
new 1 101 42
sheriff 1 101 42
in 1 101 42
town, 1 101 42
one 0 101 42
that 0 101 42
backs 0 101 42
up 0 101 42
tough 0 101 42
talk 0 101 42
with 0 101 42
action 0 101 42
and 0 101 42
doesn’t 1 101 42
ask 1 101 42
“how 1 101 42
high” 1 101 42
when 1 101 42
they 1 101 42
say 1 101 42
“jump.” 1 101 42
Clearly, 1 101 42
the 0 101 42
IRGC’s 0 101 42
new 0 101 42
docile 1 101 42
posture 1 101 42
in 0 101 42
the 0 101 42
Arabian 0 101 42
Gulf 0 101 42
is 0 101 42
a 0 101 42
direct 0 101 42
consequence 0 101 42
of 0 101 42
this 0 101 42
realization. 0 101 42
