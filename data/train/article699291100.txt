While 0
the 0
mainstream 0
media 0
has 0
largely 1
ignored 1
it, 1
the 0
scandal 0
surrounding 0
Russian 0
efforts 0
to 0
acquire 0
20% 0
of 0
America’s 0
uranium 0
reserves, 0
a 0
deal 0
which 0
was 0
ultimately 0
approved 0
by 0
the 0
Obama 0
administration, 0
and 0
more 0
specifically 0
the 0
Committee 0
on 0
Foreign 0
Investment 0
in 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
(CFIUS) 0
which 0
included 0
Hillary 0
Clinton 0
and 0
Eric 0
Holder, 0
is 0
becoming 0
more 0
problematic 0
for 0
Democrats 0
by 0
the 0
hour. 0

As 0
The 0
Hill 0
pointed 0
out 0
earlier 0
this 0
morning, 0
the 0
latest 0
development 0
in 0
this 0
sordid 1
tale 0
revolves 0
around 0
a 0
man 0
that 0
the 0
FBI 0
used 0
as 0
an 0
informant 0
back 0
in 0
2009 0
and 0
beyond 0
to 0
build 0
a 0
case 0
against 0
a 0
Russian 0
perpetrator 0
who 0
ultimately 0
admitted 0
to 0
bribery, 0
extortion 0
and 0
money 0
laundering. 0

The 0
informant, 0
who 0
is 0
so 0
far 0
only 0
known 0
as 0
“Confidential 0
Source 0
1,” 0
says 0
that 0
when 0
he 0
attempted 0
to 0
come 0
forward 0
last 0
year 0
with 0
information 0
that 0
linked 0
the 0
Clinton 0
Foundation 0
directly 0
to 0
the 0
scandal 0
he 0
was 0
promptly 0
silenced 0
by 0
the 0
FBI 0
and 0
the 0
Obama 0
administration. 0

Working 0
as 0
a 0
confidential 0
witness, 0
the 0
businessman 0
made 0
kickback 0
payments 0
to 0
the 0
Russians 0
with 0
the 0
approval 0
of 0
his 0
FBI 0
handlers 0
and 0
gathered 0
other 0
evidence, 0
the 0
records 0
show. 0

Sources 0
told 0
The 0
Hill 0
the 0
informant’s 0
work 0
was 0
crucial 0
to 0
the 0
government’s 0
ability 0
to 0
crack 0
a 0
multimillion 0
dollar 0
racketeering 0
scheme 0
by 0
Russian 0
nuclear 0
officials 0
on 0
U.S. 0

that 0

bribery, 0
kickbacks, 0
money 0

In 0

the 0

sent 0
to 0
the 0

to 0

an 0
American 0

from 0

Toensing 0
added 0
her 0
client 0
has 0
had 0
contact 0
from 0
multiple 0
congressional 0
committees 0
seeking 0
information 0
about 0
what 0
he 0
witnessed 0
inside 0
the 0
Russian 0
nuclear 0
industry 0
and 0
has 0
been 0
unable 0
to 0
provide 0
that 0
information 0
because 0
of 0
the 0
NDA. 0

“He 0
can’t 0
disclose 0
anything 0
that 0
he 0
came 0
upon 0
in 0
the 0
course 0
of 0
his 0
work,” 0
she 0
said. 0

The 0
information 0
the 0
client 0
possesses 0
includes 0
specific 0
allegations 0
that 0
Russian 0
executives 0
made 0
to 0
him 0
about 0
how 0
they 0
facilitated 0
the 0
Obama 0
administration’s 0
2010 0
approval 0
of 0
the 0
Uranium 0

out. 0

Sitting 0
down 0
with 0
The 0
Hill 0
earlier, 0
Toensing 0
said 0
that 0
the 0
last 0
time 0
her 0
client 0
tried 0
to 0
speak 0
out 0
“both 0
his 0
reputation 0
and 0
liberty” 0
were 0
“threatened” 1
by 0
the 0
Obama 0
administration 0
in 0
a 0
effort 0
to 0
force 0
his 0
silence. 0

“All 0
of 0
the 0
information 0
about 0
this 0
corruption 0
has 0
not 0
come 0
out,” 0
she 0
said 0
in 0
an 0
interview 0
Tuesday. 0

“And 0
so 0
my 0
client, 0
the 0
same 0
part 0
of 0
my 0
client 0
that 0
made 0
him 0
go 0
into 0
the 0
FBI 0
in 0
the 0
first 0
place, 0
says, 0
‘This 0
is 0
wrong. 0

What 0
should 0
I 0
do 0
about 0
it?’” 0

Toensing 0
said 0
she 0
also 0
possesses 0
memos 0
that 0
recount 0
how 0
the 0
Justice 0
Department 0
last 0
year 0
threatened 1
her 0
client 0
when 0
he 0
attempted 0
to 0
file 0
a 0
lawsuit 0
that 0
could 0
have 0
drawn 0
attention 0
to 0
the 0
Russian 0
corruption 0
during 0
the 0
2016 0
presidential 0
race 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
helped 0
him 0
recover 0
some 0
of 0
the 0
money 0
Russians 0
stole 0
from 0
him 0
through 0
kickbacks 0
during 0
the 0
FBI 0
probe. 0

The 0
undercover 0
client 0
witnessed 0
“a 0
lot 0
of 0
bribery 0
going 0
on 0
around 0
the 0
U.S.” 0
but 0
was 0
asked 0
by 0
the 0
FBI 0
to 0
sign 0
a 0
nondisclosure 0
agreement 0
(NDA) 0
that 0
prevents 0
him 0
from 0
revealing 0
what 0
he 0
knows 0
to 0
Congress, 0
Toensing 0
explained. 0

When 0
he 0
tried 0
to 0
bring 0
some 0
of 0
the 0
allegations 0
to 0
light 0
in 0
the 0
lawsuit 0
last 0
year, 0
“the 0
Obama 0
Justice 0
Department 0
threatened 1
him 0
with 0
loss 0
of 0
freedom. 0

They 0
said 0
they 0
would 0
bring 0
a 0
criminal 0
case 0
against 0
him 0
for 0
violating 0
an 0
NDA,” 0
she 0
added. 0

Emails 0
obtained 0
by 0
The 0
Hill 0
show 0
that 0
a 0
civil 0
attorney 0
working 0
with 0
the 0
former 0
undercover 0
witness 0
described 0
the 0
pressure 0
the 0
Justice 0
Department 0
exerted 0
to 0
keep 0
the 0
client 0
from 0
disclosing 0
to 0
a 0
federal 0
court 0
what 0
he 0
knew 0
last 0
summer. 0

“The 0
government 0
was 0
taking 0
a 0
very 0
harsh 1
position 1
that 0
threatened 1
both 0
your 0
reputation 0
and 0
liberty,” 0
the 0
civil 0
lawyer 0
wrote 0
in 0
one 0
email. 0

In 0
another, 0
she 0
added, 0
“As 0
you 0
will 0
recall 0
the 0
gov’t 0
made 0
serious 0
threats 1
sufficient 0
to 0
cause 0
you 0
to 0
withdraw 0
your 0
civil 0
complaint.” 0

As 0
we 0
pointed 0
out 0
last 0
summer 0
when 0
Peter 0
Schweizer 0
first 0
released 0
his 0
feature 0

Clinton 0
Cash, 0
the 0
Uranium 0
One 0
deal 0
at 0
the 0
center 0
of 0
this 0
scandal 0
is 0
believed 0
to 0
have 0
netted 0
the 0
Clintons 0
and 0
their 0
Clinton 0
Foundation 0
millions 0
of 0
dollars 0
in 0
donations 0
and 0

from 0

Contributions 0
to 0
the 0

Foundation 0
– 0
Bill 0

Hillary 0
Clinton 0
assisted 0
a 0
Canadian 0
financier, 0
Frank 0
Giustra, 0
and 0
his 0
company, 0
Uranium 0

in 0
the 0
acquisition 0
of 0
uranium 0
mining 0
concessions 0
in 0
Kazakhstan 0
and 0
the 0
United 0
States. 0

Subsequently, 0
the 0
Russian 0
government 0
sought 0
to 0
purchase 0
Uranium 0
One 0
but 0
required 0
approval 0
from 0
the 0
Obama 0
administration 0
given 0
the 0
strategic 0
importance 0
of 0
the 0
uranium 0
assets. 0

In 0
the 0
run-up 0
to 0
the 0
approval 0
of 0
the 0
deal 0
by 0
the 0
State 0
Department, 0
nine 0
shareholders 0
of 0
Uranium 0
One 0
just 0
happened 0
to 0
make 0
$145mm 0
in 0
donations 0
to 0
the 0
Clinton 0
Foundation. 0

Moreover, 0
the 0
New 0
Yorker 0
confirmed 0
that 0
Bill 0
Clinton 0
received 0
$500,000 0
in 0
speaking 0
fees 0
from 0
a 0
Russian 0
investment 0
bank, 0
with 0
ties 0
to 0
the 0
Kremlin, 0
around 0
the 0
same 0
time. 0

Needless 0
to 0
say, 0
the 0
State 0
Department 0
approved 0
the 0
deal 0
giving 0
Russia 0
ownership 0
of 0
20% 0
of 0
U.S. 0
uranium 0
assets. 0

Meanwhile, 0
the 0

over 0
at 0

are 0
still 0
trying 0
to 0
get 0
to 0
