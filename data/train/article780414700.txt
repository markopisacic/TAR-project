Editor’s 0
Note: 0
Over 0
the 0
years, 0
Bishop 0
Robert 0
Morlino 0
of 0
the 0
Diocese 0
of 0
Madison 0
has 0
confirmed 0
several 0
of 0
my 0
children 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
traditional 0
Rite 0
of 0
Confirmation, 0
as 0
his 0
diocese 0
has 0
been 0
a 1
port 1
in 1
the 1
storm 1
for 0
many 0
displaced 0
and 0
disillusioned 0
Catholic 0
families. 0

We 0
don’t 0
see 0
eye-to-eye 0
on 0
everything, 0
of 0
course, 0
but 0
his 0
faith 0
and 0
pastoral 0
solicitude 0
have 0
for 0
us 0
been 0
a 0
light 1
in 1
the 1
darkness 1
and 0
proof 0
that 0
God 0
has 0
not 0
left 0
us 0
orphans. 0

And 0
now 0
this, 0
finally, 0
a 1
bishop 1
with 1
the 1
courage 1
to 1
look 1
the 1
beast 1
in 1
the 1
eye 1
and 1
speak 1
its 1
name 1
out 1
loud. 1

Bishop 0
Morlino 0
does 0
this 0
in 0
a 0
moment 0
when 0
he 0
is 0
under 0
heavy 0
attack 0
as 0
a 1
“hater” 1
for 0
defending 0
the 0
Church’s 0
teaching 0
on 0
marriage—an 0
attack, 0
by 0
the 0
way, 0
which 0
prompted 0
us 0
here 0
at 0
The 0
Remnant 0
to 0
join 0
the 0
fight 0
to 0
DEFEND 1
BISHOP 1
MORLINO 1
last 0
year. 0

"If 0
you'll 0
permit 0
me, 0
what 0
the 1
Church 1
needs 1
now 1
is 1
more 1
hatred! 1

As 0
I 0
have 0
said 0
previously, 0
St. 0
Thomas 0
Aquinas 0
said 0
that 0
hatred 0
of 0
wickedness 0
actually 0
belongs 0
to 0
the 0
virtue 0
of 0
charity. 0

As 0
the 0
Book 0
of 0
Proverbs 0
says 0
'My 0
mouth 0
shall 0
meditate 0
truth, 0
and 0
my 0
lips 0
shall 0
hate 0
wickedness 0
(Prov. 0

8:7).' 0

It 1
is 1
an 1
act 1
of 1
love 1
to 1
hate 1
sin 1
and 1
to 1
call 1
others 1
to 1
turn 1
away 1
from 1
sin. 1

– 0
Bishop 0
Robert 0
Morlino 0

This 0
is 0
what 0
a 1
courageous 1
shepherd 1
looks 0
like! 0

In 1
our 1
opinion, 1
during 1
the 1
most 1
vile 1
clergy 1
sex 1
scandal 1
in 1
history, 1
every 1
bishop 1
in 1
the 1
country 1
must 1
do 1
exactly 1
what 1
Bishop 1
Morlino 1
has 1
done, 1
i.e., 1
issue 1
a 1
statement 1
of 1
fidelity 1
to 1
the 1
Church’s 1
moral 1
theology, 1
specifically 1
her 1
teaching 1
against 1
the 1
mortal 1
sin 1
of 1
homosexual 1
acts. 1

In 0
so 0
doing, 0
the 0
bishops 0
will 0
incur 0
the 1
wrath 1
of 1
the 1
enemies 1
of 1
the 1
Church, 1
yes. 0

They 1
will 1
be 1
crucified 1
in 1
the 1
media, 1
yes. 1

But 1
they 1
will 1
also 1
be 1
doing 1
their 1
sacred 1
duty 1
before 1
God 1
in 1
reassuring 1
their 1
thoroughly 1
scandalized 1
flocks 1
that 1
they 1
are 1
absolutely 1
committed 1
to 1
the 1
defense 1
and 1
enforcement 1
of 1
the 1
Church’s 1
moral 1
teaching 1
at 1
a 1
time 1
when 1
it 1
is 1
under 1
scurrilous 1
attack 1
from 1
within. 1

Nothing 1
less 1
will 1
do. 1

Bishop 0
Morlino 0
has 0
now 0
done 0
it, 0
and 0
we 1
respectfully 1
demand 1
that 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
the 1
American 1
bishops 1
either 1
follow 1
suit 1
or 1
face 1
the 1
charge 1
of 1
being 1
complicit 1
with 1
the 1
degenerate 1
and 1
even 1
criminal 1
shepherds, 1
accounts 1
of 1
whose 1
betrayal 1
and 1
vice 1
now 1
dominate 1
the 1
news. 1

May 1
God 1
bless 1
and 1
keep 1
Bishop 1
Robert 1
Morlino. 1

letter 0
to 0
the 0
faithful 0
on 0
the 0
ongoing 0
sexual 0
abuse 0
crisis 0
in 0
the 0
Church 0

August 0

2018 0

Dear 0
brothers 0
and 0
sisters 0
in 0
Christ 0
of 0
the 0
Diocese 0
of 0
Madison, 0

The 0
past 0
weeks 0
have 0
brought 0
a 0
great 0
deal 0
of 0
scandal, 0
justified 0
anger, 0
and 0
a 0
call 0
for 0
answers 0
and 0
action 0
by 0
many 0
faithful 0
Catholics 0
here 0
in 0
the 0
U.S. 0
and 0
overseas, 0
directed 0
at 0
the 0
Church 0
hierarchy 0
regarding 0
sexual 0
sins 0
by 0
bishops, 0
priests, 0
and 0
even 0
cardinals. 0

Still 0
more 0
anger 0
is 0
rightly 0
directed 0
at 0
those 0
who 0
have 0
been 0
complicit 0
in 0
keeping 0
some 0
of 0
these 0
serious 0
sins 0
from 0
coming 0
to 0
light. 0

For 0
my 0
part 0
— 0
and 0
I 0
know 0
I 0
am 0
not 0
alone 0
— 0
I 1
am 1
tired 1
of 1
this. 1

I 1
am 1
tired 1
of 0
people 0
being 0
hurt, 0
gravely 1
hurt! 1

I 1
am 1
tired 1
of 0
the 0
obfuscation 0
of 0
truth. 0

I 1
am 1
tired 1
of 0
sin. 0

And, 0
as 0
one 0
who 0
has 0
tried 0
— 0
despite 0
my 0
many 0
imperfections 0
— 0
to 0
lay 0
down 0
my 0
life 0
for 0
Christ 0
and 0
His 0
Church, 0
I 1
am 1
tired 1
of 0
the 0
regular 0
violation 0
of 0
sacred 0
duties 0
by 0
those 1
entrusted 1
with 1
immense 1
responsibility 1
from 1
the 1
Lord 1
for 1
the 1
care 1
of 1
His 1
people. 1

The 0
stories 0
being 0
brought 0
into 0
light 0
and 0
displayed 0
in 0
gruesome 1
detail 1
with 0
regard 0
to 0
some 0
priests, 0
religious, 0
and 0
now 0
even 0
those 0
in 0
places 0
of 0
highest 0
leadership, 0
are 0
sickening. 1

Hearing 0
even 0
one 0
of 0
these 0
stories 0
is, 0
quite 1
literally, 1
enough 1
to 1
make 1
someone 1
sick. 1

But 0
my 0
own 0
sickness 1
at 0
the 0
stories 0
is 0
quickly 0
put 0
into 0
perspective 0
when 0
I 0
recall 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
many 0
individuals 0
have 0
lived 0
through 0
them 0
for 0
years. 0

For 0
them, 0
these 0
are 0
not 0
stories, 0
they 0
are 0
indeed 0
realities. 0

To 0
them 0
I 0
turn 0
and 0
say, 0
again, 0
I 0
am 0
sorry 0
for 0
what 0
you 0
have 0
suffered 0
and 0
what 0
you 0
continue 0
to 0
suffer 0
in 0
your 0
mind 0
and 0
in 0
your 0
heart. 0

If 0
you 0
have 0
not 0
already 0
done 0
so, 0
I 0
beg 0
you 0
to 0
reach 0
out, 0
as 0
hard 0
as 0
that 0
may 0
be, 0
and 0
seek 0
help 0
to 0
begin 0
to 0
heal. 0

Also, 0
if 0
you’ve 0
been 0
hurt 0
by 0
a 0
priest 0
of 0
our 0
diocese, 0
I 0
encourage 0
you 0
to 0
come 0
forward, 0
to 0
make 0
a 0
report 0
to 0
law 0
enforcement 0
and 0
to 0
our 0
Victim’s 0
Assistance 0
Coordinator, 0
so 0
that 0
we 0
might 0
begin, 0
with 0
you 0
as 0
an 0
individual, 0
to 0
try 0
and 0
set 0
things 0
right 0
to 0
the 0
greatest 0
extent 0
possible. 0

There 0
is 0
nothing 0
about 0
these 0
stories 0
that 0
is 0
okay. 0

These 1
actions, 1
committed 1
by 1
more 1
than 1
a 1
few, 1
can 1
only 1
be 1
classified 1
as 1
evil, 1
evil 1
that 1
cries 1
out 1
for 1
justice 1
and 1
sin 1
that 1
must 1
be 1
cast 1
out 1
from 1
our 1
Church. 1

Faced 0
with 0
stories 0
of 0
the 0
depravity 0
of 0
sinners 0
within 0
the 0
Church, 0
I 0
have 0
been 0
tempted 0
to 0
despair. 0

And 0
why? 0

The 0
reality 0
of 0
sin 0
— 0
even 0
sin 0
in 0
the 0
Church 0
— 0
is 0
nothing 0
new. 0

We 0
are 0
a 0
Church 0
made 0
of 0
sinners, 0
but 0
we 0
are 0
sinners 0
called 0
to 0
sanctity. 0

So 0
what 0
is 0
new? 0

What 0
is 0
new 0
is 0
the 0
seeming 0
acceptance 0
of 0
sin 0
by 0
some 0
in 0
the 0
Church, 0
and 0
the 0
apparent 0
efforts 0
to 0
cover 0
over 0
sin 0
by 0
them 0
and 0
others. 0

Unless 1
and 1
until 1
we 1
take 1
seriously 1
our 1
call 1
to 1
sanctity, 1
we, 1
as 1
an 1
institution 1
and 1
as 1
individuals, 1
will 1
continue 1
to 1
suffer 1
the 1
“wages 1
of 1
sin.” 1

For 0
too 0
long 0
we 0
have 0
diminished 0
the 0
reality 0
of 0
sin 0
— 0
we 0
have 0
refused 0
to 0
call 0
a 0
sin 0
a 0
sin 1
— 0
and 0
we 1
have 1
excused 1
sin 1
in 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
a 1
mistaken 1
notion 1
of 1
mercy. 1

In 0
our 0
efforts 0
to 0
be 0
open 0
to 0
the 0
world 0
we 0
have 0
become 0
all 0
too 0
willing 0
to 0
abandon 0
the 0
Way, 0
the 0
Truth, 0
and 0
the 0
Life. 0

In 0
order 0
to 0
avoid 0
causing 0
offense 0
we 0
offer 0
to 0
ourselves 0
and 0
to 0
others 0
niceties 0
and 0
human 0
consolation. 0

Why 1
do 1
we 1
do 1
this? 1

Is 1
it 1
out 1
of 1
an 1
earnest 1
desire 1
to 1
display 1
a 1
misguided 1
sense 1
of 1
being 1
“pastoral?” 1
Have 1
we 1
covered 1
over 1
the 1
truth 1
out 1
of 1
fear? 1

Are 1
we 1
afraid 1
of 1
being 1
disliked 1
by 1
people 1
in 1
this 1
world? 1

Or 1
are 1
we 1
afraid 1
of 1
being 1
called 1
hypocrites 1
because 1
we 1
are 1
not 1
striving 1
tirelessly 1
for 1
holiness 1
in 1
our 1
own 1
lives? 1

Perhaps 0
these 0
are 0
the 0
reasons, 0
but 0
perhaps 0
it 0
is 0
more 0
or 0
less 0
complex 0
than 0
this. 0

In 1
the 1
end, 1
the 1
excuses 1
do 1
not 1
matter. 1

We 1
must 1
be 1
done 1
with 1
sin. 1

It 1
must 1
be 1
rooted 1
out 1
and 1
again 1
considered 1
unacceptable. 1

Love 0
sinners? 0

Yes. 0

Accept 0
true 0
repentance? 0

Yes. 0

But 0
do 0
not 0
say 0
sin 0
is 0
okay. 0

And 0
do 0
not 0
pretend 0
that 0
grave 0
violations 0
of 0
office 0
and 0
of 0
trust 0
come 0
without 0
grave, 0
lasting 0
consequences. 0

For 0
the 0
Church, 0
the 0
crisis 0
we 0
face 0
is 0
not 0
limited 0
to 0
the 0
McCarrick 0
affair, 0
or 0
the 0
Pennsylvania 0
Grand 0
Jury 0
Report, 0
or 0
anything 0
else 0
that 0
may 0
come. 0

The 0
deeper 0
crisis 0
that 0
must 0
be 0
addressed 0
is 0
the 1
license 1
for 1
sin 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
home 1
in 1
individuals 1
at 1
every 1
level 1
of 1
the 1
Church. 1

There 0
is 0
a 0
certain 0
comfort 0
level 0
with 0
sin 0
that 0
has 0
come 0
to 0
pervade 0
our 0
teaching, 0
our 0
preaching, 0
our 0
decision 0
making, 0
and 0
our 0
very 0
way 0
of 0
living. 0

If 0
you’ll 0
permit 0
me, 0
what 1
the 1
Church 1
needs 1
now 1
is 1
more 1
hatred! 1

As 0
I 0
have 0
said 0
previously, 0
St. 0
Thomas 0
Aquinas 0
said 0
that 0
hatred 0
of 0
wickedness 0
actually 0
belongs 0
to 0
the 0
virtue 0
of 0
charity. 0

As 0
the 0
Book 0
of 0
Proverbs 0
says 0
“My 0
mouth 0
shall 0
meditate 0
truth, 0
and 0
my 0
lips 0
shall 0
hate 0
wickedness 0
(Prov. 0

8:7).” 0
It 1
is 1
an 1
act 1
of 1
love 1
to 1
hate 1
sin 1
and 1
to 1
call 1
others 1
to 1
turn 1
away 1
from 1
sin. 1

There 0
must 0
be 0
no 0
room 0
left, 0
no 0
refuge 0
for 0
sin 0
— 0
either 0
within 0
our 0
own 0
lives, 0
or 0
within 0
the 0
lives 0
of 0
our 0
communities. 0

To 0
be 0
a 0
refuge 0
for 0
sinners 0
(which 0
we 0
should 0
be), 0
the 0
Church 0
must 0
be 0
a 0
place 0
where 0
sinners 0
can 0
turn 0
to 0
be 0
reconciled. 0

In 0
this 0
I 0
speak 0
of 0
all 0
sin. 0

But 0
to 0
be 0
clear, 0
in 0
the 0
specific 0
situations 0
at 0
hand, 0
we 0
are 0
talking 0
about 0
deviant 1
sexual 1
— 0
almost 0
exclusively 0
homosexual 0
— 0
acts 0
by 0
clerics. 0

We’re 0
also 0
talking 0
about 0
homosexual 0
propositions 0
and 0
abuses 0
against 0
seminarians 0
and 0
young 0
priests 0
by 0
powerful 1
priests, 1
bishops, 1
and 1
cardinals. 1

We 0
are 0
talking 0
about 0
acts 0
and 0
actions 0
which 0
are 0
not 0
only 0
in 0
violation 0
of 0
the 0
sacred 0
promises 0
made 0
by 0
some, 0
in 0
short, 0
sacrilege, 0
but 1
also 1
are 1
in 1
violation 1
of 1
the 1
natural 1
moral 1
law 1
for 1
all. 1

To 0
call 0
it 0
anything 0
else 0
would 0
be 0
deceitful 0
and 0
would 0
only 0
ignore 0
the 0
problem 0
further. 0

There 0
has 0
been 0
a 0
great 0
deal 0
of 0
effort 0
to 0
keep 0
separate 0
acts 0
which 0
fall 0
under 0
the 0
category 0
of 0
now-culturally-acceptable 1
acts 1
of 1
homosexuality 1
from 0
the 0
publically-deplorable 1
acts 1
of 1
pedophilia. 1

That 0
is 0
to 0
say, 0
until 0
recently 0
the 0
problems 0
of 0
the 0
Church 0
have 0
been 0
painted 0
purely 0
as 0
problems 0
of 0
pedophilia 0
— 0
this 0
despite 0
clear 0
evidence 0
to 0
the 0
contrary. 0

It 0
is 0
time 0
to 0
be 0
honest 0
that 0
the 0
problems 0
are 0
both 0
and 0
they 0
are 0
more. 0

To 0
fall 0
into 0
the 0
trap 0
of 0
parsing 0
problems 0
according 0
to 0
what 0
society 0
might 0
find 0
acceptable 0
or 0
unacceptable 0
is 0
ignoring 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
the 0
Church 0
has 0
never 0
held 0
ANY 0
of 0
it 0
to 0
be 0
acceptable 0
— 0
neither 0
the 0
abuse 0
of 0
children, 0
nor 0
any 0
use 0
of 0
one’s 0
sexuality 0
outside 0
of 0
the 0
marital 0
relationship, 0
nor 0
the 0
sin 0
of 0
sodomy, 0
nor 0
the 0
entering 0
of 0
clerics 0
into 0
intimate 0
sexual 0
relationships 0
at 0
all, 0
nor 0
the 0
abuse 0
and 0
coercion 0
by 0
those 0
with 0
authority. 0

In 0
this 0
last 0
regard, 0
special 0
mention 0
should 0
be 0
made 0
of 0
the 1
most 1
notorious 1
and 1
highest 1
in 1
ranking 1
case, 1
that 0
being 0
the 0
allegations 0
of 0
former-Cardinal 0
Theodore 0
McCarrick’s 0
(oft-rumored, 0
now 0
very 0
public) 0
sexual 0
sins, 0
predation, 0
and 0
abuse 0
of 0
power. 0

The 0
well-documented 0
details 0
of 0
this 0
case 0
are 0
disgraceful 1
and 0
seriously 1
scandalous, 1
as 0
is 0
any 0
covering 0
up 0
of 0
such 0
appalling 1
actions 1
by 0
other 0
Church 0
leaders 0
who 0
knew 0
about 0
it 0
based 0
on 0
solid 0
evidence. 0

While 0
recent 0
credible 0
accusations 0
of 0
child 0
sexual 0
abuse 0
by 0
Archbishop 0
McCarrick 0
have 0
brought 0
a 1
whole 1
slew 1
of 1
issues 1
to 0
light, 0
long-ignored 0
was 0
the 0
issue 0
of 0
abuse 0
of 0
his 0
power 0
for 0
the 0
sake 0
of 0
homosexual 0
gratification. 0

It 0
is 0
time 0
to 0
admit 0
that 0
there 0
is 0
a 0
homosexual 0
subculture 0
within 0
the 0
hierarchy 0
of 0
the 0
Catholic 0
Church 0
that 0
is 0
wreaking 1
great 1
devastation 1
in 1
the 1
vineyard 1
of 1
the 1
Lord. 1

The 0
Church’s 0
teaching 0
is 0
clear 0
that 0
the 0
homosexual 0
inclination 0
is 0
not 0
in 0
itself 0
sinful, 0
but 0
it 0
is 0
intrinsically 0
disordered 0
in 0
a 0
way 0
that 0
renders 0
any 0
man 0
stably 0
afflicted 0
by 0
it 0
unfit 0
to 0
be 0
a 0
priest. 0

And 0
the 0
decision 0
to 0
act 0
upon 0
this 0
disordered 0
inclination 0
is 0
a 1
sin 1
so 1
grave 1
that 1
it 1
cries 1
out 1
to 1
heaven 1
for 1
vengeance, 1
especially 0
when 0
it 0
involves 0
preying 0
upon 0
the 0
young 0
or 0
the 0
vulnerable. 0

Such 0
wickedness 1
should 0
be 0
hated 1
with 1
a 1
perfect 1
hatred. 1

Christian 0
charity 0
itself 0
demands 0
that 0
we 0
should 0
hate 0
wickedness 0
just 0
as 0
we 0
love 0
goodness. 0

But 0
while 0
hating 0
the 0
sin, 0
we 0
must 0
never 0
hate 0
the 0
sinner, 0
who 0
is 0
called 0
to 0
conversion, 0
penance, 0
and 0
renewed 0
communion 0
with 0
Christ 0
and 0
His 0
Church, 0
through 0
His 0
inexhaustible 0
mercy. 0

At 0
the 0
same 0
time, 0
however, 0
the 0
love 0
and 0
mercy 0
which 0
we 0
are 0
called 0
to 0
have 0
even 0
for 0
the 0
worst 0
of 0
sinners 0
does 0
not 0
exclude 0
holding 0
them 0
accountable 0
for 0
their 0
actions 0
through 0
a 0
punishment 0
proportionate 0
to 0
the 0
gravity 0
of 0
their 0
offense. 0

In 0
fact, 0
a 0
just 0
punishment 0
is 0
an 0
important 0
work 0
of 0
love 0
and 0
mercy, 0
because, 0
while 0
it 0
serves 0
primarily 0
as 0
retribution 0
for 0
the 0
offense 0
committed, 0
it 1
also 1
offers 1
the 1
guilty 1
party 1
an 1
opportunity 1
to 1
make 1
expiation 1
for 1
his 1
sin 1
in 1
this 1
life 1
(if 1
he 1
willingly 1
accepts 1
his 1
punishment), 1
thus 1
sparing 1
him 1
worse 1
punishment 1
in 1
the 1
life 1
to 1
come. 1

Motivated, 0
therefore, 0
by 0
love 0
and 0
concern 0
for 0
souls, 0
I 0
stand 0
with 0
those 0
calling 0
for 0
justice 0
to 0
be 0
done 0
upon 0
the 0
guilty. 0

The 0
sins 0
and 0
crimes 0
of 0
McCarrick, 0
and 0
of 0
far 0
too 0
many 0
others 0
in 0
the 0
Church, 0
bring 0
suspicion 0
and 0
mistrust 0
upon 0
many 1
good 1
and 1
virtuous 1
priests, 1
bishops, 1
and 1
cardinals, 1
and 0
suspicion 0
and 0
mistrust 0
upon 0
many 1
great 1
and 1
respectable 1
seminaries 1
and 0
so 1
many 1
holy 1
and 1
faithful 1
seminarians. 1

The 0
result 0
of 0
the 0
first 0
instance 0
of 0
mistrust 0
harms 0
the 0
Church 0
and 0
the 0
very 0
good 0
work 0
we 0
do 0
in 0
Christ’s 0
name. 0

It 0
causes 0
others 0
to 0
sin 0
in 0
their 0
thoughts, 0
words, 0
and 0
deeds 0
— 0
which 0
is 0
the 0
very 0
definition 0
of 0
scandal. 0

And 0
the 0
second 0
mistrust 0
harms 0
the 0
future 0
of 0
the 0
Church, 0
since 0
our 0
future 0
priests 0
are 0
at 0
stake. 0

I 0
said 0
that 0
I 0
was 0
tempted 0
to 0
despair 0
in 0
light 0
of 0
all 0
of 0
this. 0

However, 0
that 0
temptation 0
quickly 0
passed, 0
thanks 0
be 0
to 0
God. 0

No 0
matter 0
how 0
large 0
the 0
problem, 0
we 0
know 0
that 0
we 0
are 0
called 0
to 0
go 0
forward 0
in 0
faith, 0
to 0
rely 0
upon 0
God’s 0
promises 0
to 0
us, 0
and 0
to 0
work 0
hard 0
to 0
make 0
every 0
bit 0
of 0
difference 0
we 0
can, 0
within 0
our 0
spheres 0
of 0
influence. 0

I 0
have 0
recently 0
had 0
the 0
opportunity 0
to 0
talk 0
directly 0
with 0
our 0
seminarians 0
about 0
these 0
very 0
pressing 0
matters, 0
and 0
I 0
have 0
begun 0
to, 0
and 0
will 0
continue 0
to, 0
talk 0
with 0
the 0
priests 0
of 0
the 0
diocese, 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
the 0
faithful, 0
in 0
person 0
and 0
through 0
my 0
weekly 0
column 0
and 0
homilies, 0
making 0
things 0
as 0
clear 0
as 0
I 0
can, 0
from 0
my 0
perspective. 0

Here 0
now, 0
I 0
offer 0
a 0
few 0
thoughts 0
to 0
those 0
of 0
my 0
diocese: 0

In 0
the 0
first 0
place, 0
we 0
must 0
continue 0
to 0
build 0
upon 0
the 0
good 0
work 0
which 0
we 0
have 0
accomplished 0
in 0
protecting 0
the 0
youth 0
and 0
vulnerable 0
of 0
our 0
diocese. 0

This 0
is 0
a 0
work 0
on 0
which 0
we 0
can 0
never 0
rest 0
in 0
our 0
vigilance, 0
nor 0
our 0
efforts 0
to 0
improve. 0

We 0
must 0
continue 0
in 0
our 0
work 0
of 0
education 0
for 0
all 0
and 0
hold 0
to 0
the 0
effective 0
policies 0
that 0
have 0
been 0
implemented, 0
requiring 0
psychological 0
exams 0
for 0
all 0
candidates 0
for 0
ministry, 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
across-the-board 0
background 0
checks 0
for 0
anyone 0
working 0
with 0
children 0
or 0
vulnerable 0
individuals. 0

Here 0
again, 0
I 0
state, 0
as 0
we 0
have 0
done 0
consistently, 0
if 0
you 0
have 0
knowledge 0
of 0
any 0
sort 0
of 0
criminal 0
abuse 0
of 0
children 0
by 0
someone 0
in 0
the 0
Church, 0
contact 0
law 0
enforcement. 0

If 0
you 0
need 0
help 0
in 0
contacting 0
law 0
enforcement 0
contact 0
our 0
Victim’s 0
Assistance 0
Coordinator 0
and 0
she 0
will 0
help 0
connect 0
you 0
with 0
the 0
best 0
resources. 0

If 0
you 0
are 0
an 0
adult 0
victim 0
of 0
sexual 0
abuse 0
from 0
childhood, 0
we 0
still 0
encourage 0
you 0
to 0
reach 0
out 0
to 0
law 0
enforcement 0
first, 0
but 0
even 0
if 0
you 0
don’t 0
want 0
to, 0
please 0
still 0
reach 0
out 0
to 0
us. 0

To 0
our 0
seminarians: 0
If 0
you 0
are 0
unchastely 0
propositioned, 0
abused, 0
or 0
threatened 0
(no 0
matter 0
by 0
whom), 0
or 0
if 0
you 0
directly 0
witness 0
unchaste 0
behavior, 0
report 0
it 0
to 0
me 0
and 0
to 0
the 0
seminary 0
rector. 0

I 0
will 0
address 0
it 0
swiftly 1
and 1
vigorously. 1

I 1
will 1
not 1
stand 1
for 1
this 1
in 0
my 0
diocese 0
or 0
anywhere 0
I 0
send 0
men 0
for 0
formation. 0

I 0
trust 0
that 0
the 0
seminaries 0
I 0
choose, 0
very 0
discriminately, 0
to 0
help 0
form 0
our 0
men 0
will 0
not 0
ignore 0
this 0
type 0
of 0
scandalous 1
behavior, 0
and 0
I 0
will 0
continue 0
to 0
verify 0
that 0
expectation. 0

To 0
our 0
priests: 0
Most 0
simply, 0
live 0
out 0
the 0
promises 0
you 0
made 0
on 0
your 0
ordination 0
day. 0

You 0
are 0
called 0
to 0
serve 0
Christ’s 0
people, 0
beginning 0
with 0
praying 0
daily 0
the 0
Liturgy 0
of 0
the 0
Hours. 0

This 0
is 0
to 0
keep 0
you 0
very 0
close 0
to 0
God. 0

In 0
addition, 0
you 0
promised 0
to 0
obey 0
and 0
be 0
loyal 0
to 0
your 0
bishop. 0

In 0
obedience, 0
strive 0
to 0
live 0
out 0
your 0
priesthood 0
as 1
a 1
holy 1
priest, 1
a 1
hard 1
working 1
priest, 1
and 1
a 1
pure 1
and 1
happy 1
priest 1
— 0
as 0
Christ 0
Himself 0
is 0
calling 0
you 0
to 0
do. 0

And 0
by 0
extension, 0
live 0
a 0
chaste 0
and 0
celibate 0
life 0
so 0
that 0
you 0
can 0
completely 0
give 0
your 0
life 0
to 0
Christ, 0
the 0
Church, 0
and 0
the 0
people 0
whom 0
he 0
has 0
called 0
you 0
to 0
serve. 0

God 0
will 0
give 0
you 0
the 0
graces 0
to 0
do 0
so. 0

Ask 0
Him 0
for 0
the 0
help 0
you 0
need 0
daily 0
and 0
throughout 0
every 0
day. 0

And 0
if 0
you 0
are 0
unchastely 0
propositioned, 0
abused, 0
or 0
threatened 0
(no 0
matter 0
by 0
whom), 0
or 0
if 0
you 0
directly 0
witness 0
unchaste 0
behavior, 0
report 0
it 0
to 0
me. 0

I 1
will 1
not 1
stand 1
for 1
this 1
in 0
my 0
diocese 0
any 0
more 0
than 0
in 0
our 0
seminaries. 0

To 0
the 0
faithful 0
of 0
the 0
diocese: 0
If 0
you 0
are 0
the 0
victim 0
of 0
abuse 0
of 0
any 0
kind 0
by 0
a 0
priest, 0
bishop, 0
cardinal, 0
or 0
any 0
employee 0
of 0
the 0
Church, 0
bring 0
it 0
forward. 0

It 0
will 0
be 0
addressed 0
quickly 0
and 0
justly. 0

If 0
you 0
have 0
directly 0
witnessed 0
sexual 0
advances 0
or 0
any 0
type 0
of 0
abuse, 0
bring 0
it 0
forward 0
as 0
well. 0

Such 0
actions 0
are 0
sinful 1
and 1
scandalous 1
and 0
we 0
cannot 0
allow 0
anyone 0
to 0
use 0
their 0
position 0
or 0
power 0
to 0
abuse 0
another 0
person. 0

Again, 0
in 0
addition 0
to 0
injuring 0
individuals, 0
these 0
actions 0
injure 1
the 1
very 1
Body 1
of 1
Christ, 1
His 1
Church. 1

Furthermore, 0
I 0
add 0
my 0
name 0
to 0
those 0
calling 0
for 0
real 0
and 0
sustained 0
reform 0
in 0
the 0
episcopate, 0
priesthood, 0
our 0
parishes, 0
schools, 0
universities, 0
and 0
seminaries 0
that 0
would 0
root 0
out 0
and 0
hold 0
accountable 0
any 0
would-be 0
sexual 0
predator 0
or 0
accomplice; 0

I 0
will 0
hold 0
the 0
priests 0
of 0
the 0
diocese 0
to 0
their 0
promise 0
to 0
live 0
a 0
chaste 0
and 0
celibate 0
life 0
of 0
service 0
to 0
you 0
and 0
your 0
parish, 0
and 0
evidence 0
of 0
failure 0
in 0
this 0
regard 0
will 0
be 0
justly 0
addressed; 0

I 0
will 0
likewise 0
hold 0
every 0
man 0
studying 0
for 0
the 0
priesthood 0
for 0
our 0
diocese 0
accountable 0
to 0
living 0
a 0
chaste 0
and 0
celibate 0
life 0
as 0
part 0
of 0
his 0
formation 0
for 0
the 0
priesthood. 0

Failure 1
to 1
do 1
so 1
will 1
lead 1
to 1
dismissal 1
from 1
diocesan 1
sponsorship; 1

I 0
will 0
continue 0
to 0
require 0
(with 0
our 0
men 0
and 0
our 0
funds) 0
that 0
all 0
seminaries 0
to 0
which 0
we 0
send 0
men 0
to 0
study 0
be 0
vigilant 0
that 0
seminarians 0
are 0
protected 0
from 0
sexual 0
predators 0
and 0
provide 0
an 0
atmosphere 0
conducive 0
to 0
their 0
holistic 0
formation 0
as 0
holy 0
priests, 0
in 0
the 0
image 0
of 0
Christ; 0

I 0
ask 0
all 0
the 0
faithful 0
of 0
the 0
diocese 0
to 0
assist 0
in 0
keeping 0
us 0
accountable 0
to 0
civil 0
authorities, 0
the 0
faithful 0
in 0
the 0
pews, 0
and 0
to 0
God 0
Almighty, 0
not 0
only 0
to 0
protect 0
children 0
and 0
the 0
youth 0
from 0
sexual 0
predators 0
in 0
the 0
Church, 0
but 0
our 0
seminarians, 0
university 0
students, 0
and 0
all 0
the 0
faithful 0
as 0
well. 0

I 0
promise 0
to 0
put 0
any 0
victim 0
and 0
their 0
sufferings 0
before 0
that 0
of 0
the 0
personal 0
and 0
professional 0
reputation 0
of 0
a 0
priest, 0
or 0
any 0
Church 0
employee, 0
guilty 0
of 0
abuse; 0

I 0
ask 0
everyone 0
reading 0
this 0
to 0
pray. 0

Pray 1
earnestly 0
for 0
the 0
Church 0
and 0
all 0
her 0
ministers. 0

Pray 1
for 0
our 0
seminarians. 0

And 0
pray 1
for 0
yourselves 0
and 0
your 0
families. 0

We 0
must 0
all 0
work 0
daily 0
on 0
our 1
own 1
personal 1
holiness 1
and 0
hold 0
ourselves 0
accountable 0
first 0
and, 0
in 0
turn, 0
hold 0
our 0
brothers 0
and 0
sisters 0
accountable 0
as 0
well, 0
and 0

Finally, 0
I 0
ask 0
you 0
all 0
to 0
join 0
me 0
and 0
the 0
entire 0
clergy 0
of 0
the 0
Diocese 0
of 0
Madison 0
in 0
making 0
public 0
and 0
private 0
acts 0
of 0
reparation 0
to 0
the 0
Most 0
Sacred 0
Heart 0
of 0
Jesus 0
and 0
to 0
the 0
Immaculate 0
Heart 0
of 0
Mary 0
for 0
all 0
the 0
sins 0
of 0
sexual 0
depravity 0
committed 0
by 0
members 0
of 0
the 0
clergy 0
and 0
episcopacy. 0

I 1
will 1
be 1
offering 1
a 1
public 1
Mass 1
of 1
reparation 1
on 1
Friday, 1
September 1
14, 1
the 1
Feast 1
of 1
the 1
Triumph 1
of 1
the 1
Holy 1
Cross, 1
at 1
Holy 1
Name 1
Heights 1
and 1
I 1
ask 1
all 1
pastors 1
to 1
do 1
the 1
same 1
in 1
their 1
own 1
parishes. 1

In 0
addition, 0
I 0
ask 0
that 0
all 0
priests, 0
clergy, 0
religious, 0
and 0
diocesan 0
employees 0
join 0
me 0
in 0
observing 0
the 0
upcoming 0
Autumn 0
Ember 0
Days 0
(Sep. 0
19, 0
21, 0
and 0
22) 0
as 0
days 0
of 0
fasting 0
and 0
abstinence 0
in 0
reparation 0
for 0
the 0
sins 1
and 1
outrages 1
committed 0
by 0
members 0
of 0
the 0
clergy 0
and 0
episcopacy 0
and 0
I 0
invite 0
all 0
the 0
faithful 0
to 0
do 0
the 0
same. 0

Some 0
sins, 0
like 0
some 0
demons, 0
can 0
only 0
be 0
driven 0
out 0
by 0
prayer 0
and 0
fasting. 0

This 0
letter 0
and 0
these 0
statements 0
and 0
promises 0
are 0
not 0
intended 0
to 0
be 0
an 0
exhaustive 0
list 0
of 0
what 0
we 0
can 0
and 0
need 0
to 0
do 0
in 0
the 0
Church 0
to 0
begin 0
to 0
heal 0
from, 0
and 0
stave 1
off, 1
this 1
deep 1
illness 1
in 1
the 1
Church, 1
but 0
rather 0
the 0
next 0
steps 0
I 0
believe 0
we 0
can 0
take 0
locally. 0

More 0
than 0
anything 0
else, 0
we 0
as 0
a 0
Church 0
must 0
cease 0
our 0
acceptance 0
of 0
sin 0
and 0
evil. 0

We 0
must 0
cast 1
out 1
sin 1
from 1
our 1
own 1
lives 1
and 1
run 1
toward 1
holiness. 1

We 0
must 0
refuse 0
to 0
be 0
silent 0
in 0
the 0
face 0
of 0
sin 0
and 0
evil 0
in 0
our 0
families 0
and 0
communities 0
and 0
we 0
must 0
demand 0
from 0
our 0
pastors 0
— 0
myself 0
included 0
— 0
that 0
they 0
themselves 0
are 0
striving 0
day 0
in 0
and 0
day 0
out 0
for 0
holiness. 0

We 0
must 0
do 0
this 0
always 0
with 0
loving 0
respect 0
for 0
individuals 0
but 0
with 0
a 0
clear 0
understanding 0
that 0
true 0
love 0
can 0
never 0
exist 0
without 0
truth. 0

Again, 0
right 0
now 0
there 0
is 0
a 0
lot 0
of 0
justified 0
anger 0
and 0
passion 0
coming 0
from 0
many 0
holy 0
and 0
faithful 0
lay 0
people 0
and 0
clerics 0
across 0
the 0
country, 0
calling 0
for 0
real 0
reform 0
and 0
“house 0
cleaning” 0
of 0
this 0
type 0
of 0
depravity. 0

I 0
stand 0
with 0
them. 0

I 0
don’t 0
know 0
yet 0
how 0
this 0
will 0
play 0
out 0
nationally 0
or 0
internationally. 0

But 0
I 0
do 0
know 0
this, 0
and 0
I 0
make 0
this 0
my 0
last 0
point 0
and 0
last 0
promise, 0
for 0
the 0
Diocese 0
of 0
Madison: 0
“As 0
for 0
me 0
and 0
my 0
household, 0
we 1
will 1
serve 1
the 1
Lord.” 1

Faithfully 0
yours 0
in 0
the 0
Lord, 0
