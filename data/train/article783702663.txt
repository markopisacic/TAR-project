now 0 96 3
becomes 0 96 3
merely 0 96 3
illustrative 0 96 3

points 0 96 3
to 0 96 3
be 0 96 3

here 0 96 3
in 0 96 3

this 0 96 3
astonishing 1 96 3
and 1 96 3
indeed 1 96 3
providential 1 96 3
development. 1 96 3

Regarding 0 96 4
Bergoglio, 0 96 4
Viganò 0 96 4
testifies 0 96 4
that 0 96 4
in 0 96 4
2013 0 96 4
he 0 96 4
personally 0 96 4
informed 0 96 4
him 0 96 4
about 0 96 4
McCarrick’s 0 96 4
history, 0 96 4
the 0 96 4
dossier 0 96 4
of 0 96 4
the 0 96 4
Congregation 0 96 4
for 0 96 4
Bishops 0 96 4
on 0 96 4
his 0 96 4
sexual 0 96 4
crimes 0 96 4
against 0 96 4
boys 0 96 4
and 0 96 4
young 0 96 4
men, 0 96 4
and 0 96 4
the 0 96 4
disciplinary 0 96 4
sanctions 0 96 4
imposed 0 96 4
upon 0 96 4
him 0 96 4
by 0 96 4
Benedict 0 96 4
XVI 0 96 4
(forbidding 0 96 4
residence 0 96 4
in 0 96 4
a 0 96 4
seminary, 0 96 4
public 0 96 4
appearances 0 96 4
and 0 96 4
Masses). 0 96 4

Evidently 0 96 5
already 0 96 5
aware 0 96 5
of 0 96 5
these 0 96 5
facts, 0 96 5
however, 0 96 5
Bergoglio 0 96 5
not 0 96 5
only 0 96 5
rehabilitated 0 96 5
McCarrick 0 96 5
but 0 96 5
made 0 96 5
him 0 96 5
a 0 96 5
“trusted 0 96 5
counselor” 0 96 5
who 0 96 5
advised 0 96 5
the 0 96 5
elevation 0 96 5
of 0 96 5
the 0 96 5
pro-homosexual 0 96 5
prelates 0 96 5
Blase 0 96 5
Cupich, 0 96 5
Joseph 0 96 5

and 0 96 5
the 0 96 5
prominent 0 96 5
episcopal 0 96 5
sees 0 96 5
they 0 96 5
now 0 96 5
discredit. 0 96 5

All 0 96 6
of 0 96 6
this 0 96 6
happened 0 96 6
before 0 96 6
Bergoglio, 0 96 6
bowing 0 96 6
to 0 96 6
worldwide 0 96 6
public 0 96 6
pressure, 0 96 6
finally—only 0 96 6
weeks 0 96 6
ago—took 0 96 6
decisive 0 96 6
action 0 96 6
against 0 96 6
his 0 96 6
“trusted 1 96 6
counselor.” 1 96 6
McCarrick 0 96 6
had 0 96 6
lobbied 0 96 6
for 0 96 6
Bergoglio’s 0 96 6
election, 0 96 6
along 0 96 6
with 0 96 6
Maradiaga 0 96 6
and 0 96 6
the 1 96 6
infamous 1 96 6
Cardinal 1 96 6
Danneels, 0 96 6
who 1 96 6
covered 1 96 6
up 1 96 6
homosexual 1 96 6
rape 1 96 6
committed 1 96 6
by 1 96 6
a 1 96 6
priest 1 96 6
against 1 96 6
his 1 96 6
own 1 96 6
nephew,has 1 96 6
supported 1 96 6
“same-sex 1 96 6
marriage,” 1 96 6
and 1 96 6
advised 1 96 6
the 1 96 6
King 1 96 6
of 1 96 6
Belgium 1 96 6
to 1 96 6
sign 1 96 6
a 1 96 6
law 1 96 6
legalizing 1 96 6
abortion 1 96 6
in 1 96 6
1990. 1 96 6

As 1 96 7
Edward 1 96 7
Pentin 1 96 7
notes: 1 96 7
“all 1 96 7
3 1 96 7
prelates 1 96 7
have 1 96 7
since 1 96 7
been 1 96 7
special 1 96 7
advisors 1 96 7
of 1 96 7
Francis 1 96 7
or 1 96 7
rehabilitated 1 96 7
by 1 96 7
him.” 1 96 7

Viganò 0 96 8
concludes 0 96 8
his 0 96 8
testimony 0 96 8
by 0 96 8
declaring 0 96 8
that 0 96 8
all 0 96 8
of 0 96 8
the 0 96 8
prelates 0 96 8
involved 0 96 8
(many 0 96 8
others 0 96 8
are 0 96 8
implicated), 0 96 8
including 0 96 8
Bergoglio, 0 96 8
should 0 96 8
resign 0 96 8
their 0 96 8
offices 0 96 8
for 0 96 8
the 0 96 8
good 0 96 8
of 0 96 8
the 0 96 8
Church. 0 96 8

As 0 96 9
to 0 96 9
Bergoglio 0 96 9
in 0 96 9
particular, 0 96 9
he 0 96 9
courageously 0 96 9
states 0 96 9
openly 0 96 9
the 0 96 9
truth 0 96 9
that 0 96 9
so 0 96 9
many 0 96 9
of 0 96 9
his 0 96 9
brethren 0 96 9
know 0 96 9
but 0 96 9
fear 0 96 9
to 0 96 9
speak 0 96 9
in 0 96 9
public: 0 96 9

I 0 96 10
want 0 96 10
to 0 96 10
recall 0 96 10
this 1 96 10
indefectible 1 96 10
truth 1 96 10
of 0 96 10
the 0 96 10
Church’s 0 96 10
holiness 0 96 10
to 0 96 10
the 0 96 10
many 0 96 10
people 0 96 10
who 0 96 10
have 0 96 10
been 0 96 10
so 0 96 10
deeply 1 96 10
scandalized 1 96 10
by 1 96 10
the 1 96 10
abominable 1 96 10
and 1 96 10
sacrilegious 1 96 10
behavior 1 96 10
of 0 96 10
the 0 96 10
former 0 96 10
Archbishop 0 96 10
of 0 96 10
Washington, 0 96 10
Theodore 0 96 10
McCarrick; 0 96 10
by 0 96 10
the 1 96 10
grave, 1 96 10
disconcerting 1 96 10
and 1 96 10
sinful 1 96 10
conduct 1 96 10
of 0 96 10
Pope 0 96 10
Francis 0 96 10
and 0 96 10
by 0 96 10
the 0 96 10
conspiracy 0 96 10
of 0 96 10
silence 0 96 10
of 0 96 10
so 0 96 10
many 0 96 10
pastors, 0 96 10
and 0 96 10
who 0 96 10
are 0 96 10
tempted 0 96 10
to 0 96 10
abandon 0 96 10
the 0 96 10
Church, 0 96 10
disfigured 1 96 10
by 1 96 10
so 1 96 10
many 1 96 10
ignominies. 1 96 10

At 0 96 11
the 0 96 11
Angelus 0 96 11
on 0 96 11
Sunday, 0 96 11
August 0 96 11
12, 0 96 11
2018 0 96 11
Pope 0 96 11
Francis 0 96 11
said 0 96 11
these 0 96 11
words: 0 96 11
“Everyone 1 96 11
is 1 96 11
guilty 1 96 11
for 1 96 11
the 1 96 11
good 1 96 11
he 1 96 11
could 1 96 11
have 1 96 11
done 1 96 11
and 1 96 11
did 1 96 11
not 1 96 11
do 1 96 11
... 1 96 11

If 1 96 12
we 1 96 12
do 1 96 12
not 1 96 12
oppose 1 96 12
evil, 1 96 12
we 1 96 12
tacitly 1 96 12
feed 1 96 12
it. 1 96 12

We 0 96 13
need 0 96 13
to 0 96 13
intervene 0 96 13
where 0 96 13
evil 0 96 13
is 0 96 13
spreading; 0 96 13
for 0 96 13
evil 0 96 13
spreads 0 96 13
where 0 96 13
daring 0 96 13
Christians 0 96 13
who 0 96 13
oppose 0 96 13
evil 0 96 13
with 0 96 13
good 0 96 13
are 0 96 13
lacking.” 0 96 13
[emphasis 0 96 13
in 0 96 13
original] 0 96 13
If 0 96 13
this 0 96 13
is 0 96 13
rightly 0 96 13
to 0 96 13
be 0 96 13
considered 0 96 13
a 0 96 13
serious 0 96 13
moral 0 96 13
responsibility 0 96 13
for 0 96 13
every 0 96 13
believer, 0 96 13
how 0 96 13
much 0 96 13
graver 0 96 13
is 0 96 13
it 0 96 13
for 0 96 13
the 1 96 13
Church’s 1 96 13
supreme 1 96 13
pastor, 1 96 13
who 1 96 13
in 1 96 13
the 1 96 13
case 1 96 13
of 1 96 13
McCarrick 1 96 13
not 1 96 13
only 1 96 13
did 1 96 13
not 1 96 13
oppose 1 96 13
evil 1 96 13
but 1 96 13
associated 1 96 13
himself 1 96 13
in 1 96 13
doing 1 96 13
evil 1 96 13
with 1 96 13
someone 1 96 13
he 1 96 13
knew 1 96 13
to 1 96 13
be 1 96 13
deeply 1 96 13
corrupt. 1 96 13

He 0 96 14
followed 0 96 14
the 0 96 14
advice 0 96 14
of 0 96 14
someone 1 96 14
he 1 96 14
knew 1 96 14
well 1 96 14
to 1 96 14
be 1 96 14
a 1 96 14
pervert, 1 96 14
thus 0 96 14
multiplying 0 96 14
exponentially 0 96 14
with 0 96 14
his 0 96 14
supreme 0 96 14
authority 0 96 14
the 0 96 14
evil 0 96 14
done 0 96 14
by 0 96 14
McCarrick. 0 96 14

And 0 96 15
how 0 96 15
many 0 96 15
other 0 96 15
evil 1 96 15
pastors 1 96 15
is 0 96 15
Francis 0 96 15
still 0 96 15
continuing 0 96 15
to 0 96 15
prop 0 96 15
up 0 96 15
in 0 96 15
their 1 96 15
active 1 96 15
destruction 1 96 15
of 1 96 15
the 1 96 15
Church! 1 96 15

[my 0 96 16
emphasis] 0 96 16
Francis 0 96 16
is 0 96 16
abdicating 0 96 16
the 0 96 16
mandate 0 96 16
which 0 96 16
Christ 0 96 16
gave 0 96 16
to 0 96 16
Peter 0 96 16
to 0 96 16
confirm 0 96 16
the 0 96 16
brethren. 0 96 16

Indeed, 0 96 17
by 0 96 17
his 0 96 17
action 0 96 17
he 0 96 17
has 0 96 17
divided 0 96 17
them, 0 96 17
led 0 96 17
them 0 96 17
into 0 96 17
error, 0 96 17
and 0 96 17
encouraged 1 96 17
the 1 96 17
wolves 1 96 17
to 1 96 17
continue 1 96 17
to 1 96 17
tear 1 96 17
apart 1 96 17
the 1 96 17
sheep 1 96 17
of 0 96 17
Christ’s 0 96 17
flock. 0 96 17

In 0 96 18
this 0 96 18
extremely 1 96 18
dramatic 1 96 18
moment 1 96 18
for 0 96 18
the 0 96 18
universal 0 96 18
Church, 0 96 18
he 0 96 18
must 0 96 18
acknowledge 0 96 18
his 0 96 18
mistakes 0 96 18
and, 0 96 18
in 0 96 18
keeping 0 96 18
with 0 96 18
the 0 96 18
proclaimed 0 96 18
principle 0 96 18
of 0 96 18
zero 0 96 18
tolerance, 0 96 18
Pope 0 96 18
Francis 0 96 18
must 0 96 18
be 0 96 18
the 0 96 18

In 0 96 21
those 0 96 21

With 0 96 22

the 0 96 22
widespread 0 96 22
homosexual 0 96 22

Even 0 96 23
before 0 96 23
that 0 96 23

however, 0 96 23
the 0 96 23

Yet 1 96 24
there 1 96 24
is 1 96 24
little 1 96 24
doubt 1 96 24
they 1 96 24
will 1 96 24
continue 1 96 24
the 1 96 24
same 1 96 24
polemic 1 96 24
that 1 96 24
for 1 96 24
nearly 1 96 24
sixty 1 96 24
years 1 96 24
has 1 96 24
doggedly 1 96 24
defended 1 96 24
every 1 96 24
one 1 96 24
of 1 96 24
the 1 96 24
ruinous 1 96 24
“reforms” 1 96 24
that 1 96 24
have 1 96 24
resulted 1 96 24
in 1 96 24
a 1 96 24
debacle 1 96 24
without 1 96 24
equal 1 96 24
in 1 96 24
Church 1 96 24
history, 1 96 24
even 0 96 24
considering 0 96 24
the 0 96 24

crisis 0 96 24
of 0 96 24
the 0 96 24
4th 0 96 24
century. 0 96 24

Those 0 96 25
“reforms” 0 96 25
included 0 96 25
abandonment 0 96 25
of 0 96 25
the 0 96 25
Vatican’s 0 96 25
strict 0 96 25
pre-conciliar 0 96 25
instruction 0 96 25
(1961) 0 96 25
that 0 96 25
“advancement 1 96 25
to 1 96 25
religious 1 96 25
vows 1 96 25
and 1 96 25
ordination 1 96 25
should 1 96 25
be 1 96 25
barred 1 96 25
to 1 96 25
those 1 96 25
who 1 96 25
are 1 96 25
afflicted 1 96 25
with 1 96 25
evil 1 96 25
tendencies 1 96 25
to 1 96 25
homosexuality 1 96 25

pederasty, 1 96 25

for 1 96 25
them 1 96 25
the 1 96 25
common 1 96 25
life 1 96 25
and 1 96 25
the 1 96 25
priestly 1 96 25
ministry 1 96 25
would 1 96 25
constitute 1 96 25
serious 1 96 25
dangers.” 1 96 25
Today, 1 96 25
neo-Catholic 1 96 25
commentators, 1 96 25
cowed 1 96 25
by 1 96 25
the 1 96 25
demands 1 96 25
of 1 96 25
political 1 96 25
correctness, 1 96 25
refuse 1 96 25
to 1 96 25
state 1 96 25
the 1 96 25
simple 1 96 25
truth 1 96 25
that 1 96 25
homosexuality 1 96 25
is 1 96 25
a 1 96 25
perversion 1 96 25
that 1 96 25
precludes 1 96 25
ordination 1 96 25
as 1 96 25
does 1 96 25
any 1 96 25

either 0 96 28

explain 0 96 28

his 0 96 28

one 0 96 33

from 0 96 33

a 0 96 33
bit 0 96 33
craftier. 0 96 33

His 0 96 34
opinion 0 96 34
is: 0 96 34
“Take 1 96 34
it 1 96 34
seriously, 1 96 34

Which 1 96 34
is 1 96 34
just 1 96 34
Allen’s 1 96 34
more 1 96 34
nuanced 1 96 34
way 1 96 34

you 0 96 62
have 0 96 62
drawn 0 96 62
conclusions, 0 96 62
perhaps 0 96 62
I 0 96 62
will 0 96 62
speak 0 96 62
about 0 96 62
it, 0 96 62

I 0 96 62
would 0 96 62
like 0 96 62
your 0 96 62
professional 0 96 62
maturity 0 96 62

reply 0 96 64
of 0 96 64
somebody 0 96 64
who 0 96 64
believes 0 96 64
the 0 96 64
accusations 0 96 64
are 0 96 64
groundless…”. 0 96 64

Seems 0 96 65
to 0 96 65
be. 0 96 65

Obviously. 0 96 66

The 1 96 67

Expansion 0 96 67

While 0 96 68
events 0 96 68
have 0 96 68
overtaken 0 96 68
Faggioli’s 0 96 68
piece, 0 96 68
it 0 96 68
will 0 96 68
remain 0 96 68
useful 0 96 68
here 0 96 68
as 0 96 68
a 0 96 68
prime 0 96 68
example 0 96 68
of 0 96 68
the 0 96 68
neo-Catholic 0 96 68
polemic. 0 96 68

That 0 96 69
polemic 0 96 69
seeks 0 96 69
to 0 96 69
shore 0 96 69
up 0 96 69
the 0 96 69
collapsing 0 96 69
Novus 0 96 69
Ordo 0 96 69
establishment 0 96 69
lest 0 96 69
it 0 96 69
give 0 96 69
way 0 96 69
to 0 96 69
the 1 96 69
dreaded 1 96 69
traditionalist 1 96 69
revival. 1 96 69

But 0 96 70
before 0 96 70
I 0 96 70
address 0 96 70
Faggioli’s 0 96 70
latest 0 96 70
defense 0 96 70
of 0 96 70
the 0 96 70
indefensible, 0 96 70
some 0 96 70
background 0 96 70
is 0 96 70
in 0 96 70
order, 0 96 70
including 0 96 70
a 0 96 70
discussion 0 96 70
of 0 96 70
further 0 96 70
key 0 96 70
details 0 96 70
of 0 96 70
Viganò’s 0 96 70
testimony. 0 96 70

First 0 96 71
of 0 96 71
all, 0 96 71
as 0 96 71
I 0 96 71
predicted 0 96 71
16 0 96 71
years 0 96 71
ago, 0 96 71
because 0 96 71
the 0 96 71
Vatican 0 96 71
under 0 96 71
John 0 96 71
Paul 0 96 71
II 0 96 71
had 0 96 71
no 0 96 71
intention 0 96 71
of 0 96 71
enforcing 0 96 71
the 0 96 71
pre-conciliar 0 96 71
ban 0 96 71
on 0 96 71
admission 0 96 71
of 0 96 71
homosexuals 0 96 71
to 0 96 71
the 0 96 71
seminary 0 96 71
“a 0 96 71
new 1 96 71
bumper 1 96 71
crop 1 96 71
of 1 96 71
homosexual 1 96 71
ordinands 1 96 71
is 0 96 71
guaranteed—and 0 96 71
with 0 96 71
it 0 96 71
a 1 96 71
new 1 96 71
harvest 1 96 71
of 1 96 71
scandal 1 96 71
for 1 96 71
the 1 96 71
Church.” 1 96 71
That 0 96 71
prediction 0 96 71
came 0 96 71
immediately 0 96 71
after 0 96 71
the 1 96 71
“pedophile 1 96 71
summit” 1 96 71
of 1 96 71
2002 1 96 71
in 1 96 71
Rome, 1 96 71
which 0 96 71
I 0 96 71
attended 0 96 71
as 0 96 71
The 0 96 71
Remnant’s 0 96 71
correspondent. 0 96 71

In 0 96 72
answer 0 96 72
to 0 96 72
my 0 96 72
question 0 96 72
then 0 96 72
head 0 96 72
of 0 96 72
the 0 96 72
USCCB, 0 96 72
Wilton 0 96 72
Gregory, 0 96 72
made 0 96 72
an 1 96 72
explosive 1 96 72
admission 1 96 72
reportedby 0 96 72
the 0 96 72
international 0 96 72
press: 0 96 72
“it 0 96 72
is 0 96 72
an 0 96 72
ongoing 0 96 72
struggle 0 96 72
to 0 96 72
make 0 96 72
sure 0 96 72
that 0 96 72
the 0 96 72
Catholic 0 96 72
priesthood 0 96 72
is 0 96 72
not 0 96 72
dominated 0 96 72
by 0 96 72
homosexual 0 96 72
men.” 0 96 72
The 1 96 72
struggle, 1 96 72
to 1 96 72
the 1 96 72
extent 1 96 72
there 1 96 72
even 1 96 72
was 1 96 72
one, 1 96 72
obviously 1 96 72
has 1 96 72
been 1 96 72
lost. 1 96 72

Sixteen 0 96 73
years 0 96 73
later, 0 96 73
the 1 96 73
homosexual 1 96 73
predator 1 96 73
McCarrick 0 96 73
has 0 96 73
finally 0 96 73
been 0 96 73
exposed 0 96 73
to 0 96 73
the 0 96 73
world, 0 96 73
stripped 0 96 73
of 0 96 73
his 0 96 73
cardinal’s 0 96 73
hat 0 96 73
and 0 96 73
deprived 0 96 73
of 0 96 73
any 0 96 73
ministry, 0 96 73
but 0 96 73
only 0 96 73
after 0 96 73
international 0 96 73
media 0 96 73
coverage 0 96 73
of 0 96 73
the 0 96 73
Vatican’s 0 96 73
semi-secret 0 96 73
finding 0 96 73
that 0 96 73
McCarrick 0 96 73
had 0 96 73
raped 0 96 73
a 0 96 73
teenage 0 96 73
altar 0 96 73
boy 0 96 73
47 0 96 73
years 0 96 73
ago. 0 96 73

If 0 96 74
not 0 96 74
for 0 96 74
that 0 96 74
one 0 96 74
case, 0 96 74
McCarrick’s 0 96 74
sixty 0 96 74
years 0 96 74
of 0 96 74
homosexual 1 96 74
debauchery 1 96 74
might 0 96 74
well 0 96 74
have 0 96 74
gone 0 96 74
unpunished 0 96 74
in 0 96 74
this 0 96 74
world 0 96 74
and 0 96 74
he 0 96 74
would 0 96 74
have 0 96 74
died 0 96 74
still 0 96 74
possessed 0 96 74
of 0 96 74
all 0 96 74
the 0 96 74
phony 1 96 74
honors 1 96 74
that 0 96 74
had 0 96 74
been 0 96 74
heaped 0 96 74
upon 0 96 74
him 0 96 74
throughout 0 96 74
his 0 96 74
career 0 96 74
as 0 96 74
a 1 96 74
parasite 1 96 74
in 1 96 74
the 1 96 74
Body 1 96 74
of 1 96 74
Christ, 1 96 74
including 0 96 74
the 0 96 74
favor 0 96 74
shown 0 96 74
to 0 96 74
him 0 96 74
by 0 96 74
Bergoglio. 0 96 74

The 0 96 75
telling 0 96 75
details 0 96 75
of 0 96 75
Archbishop 0 96 75
Viganò’s 0 96 75
testimony 0 96 75
concerning 0 96 75
Bergoglio’s 0 96 75
friendly 0 96 75
relations 0 96 75
with 0 96 75
McCarrick 0 96 75
before 0 96 75
he 0 96 75
finally 0 96 75
had 0 96 75
to 0 96 75
cut 0 96 75
him 0 96 75
loose—details 1 96 75
conveniently 1 96 75
ignored 1 96 75
by 1 96 75
Winters, 1 96 75
Allen 1 96 75
and 1 96 75
Shea—are 1 96 75
utterly 1 96 75
devastating 1 96 75
to 0 96 75
any 0 96 75
defense 0 96 75
of 0 96 75
Bergoglio. 0 96 75

This 0 96 76
would 0 96 76
explain 0 96 76
why 0 96 76
he 0 96 76
will 0 96 76
not 0 96 76
a 0 96 76
“say 0 96 76
a 0 96 76
word 0 96 76
about” 0 96 76
Viganò’s 0 96 76
charges 0 96 76
against 0 96 76
him. 0 96 76

The 0 96 77
Archbishop 0 96 77
reveals, 0 96 77
as 0 96 77
already 0 96 77
noted, 0 96 77
that 0 96 77
Pope 0 96 77
Benedict 0 96 77
imposed 0 96 77
sanctions 0 96 77
on 0 96 77
McCarrick 0 96 77
under 0 96 77
which 0 96 77
he 0 96 77
“was 0 96 77
to 0 96 77
leave 0 96 77
the 0 96 77
seminary 0 96 77
where 0 96 77
he 0 96 77
was 0 96 77
living, 0 96 77
he 0 96 77
was 0 96 77
forbidden 0 96 77
to 0 96 77
celebrate 0 96 77
[Mass] 0 96 77
in 0 96 77
public, 0 96 77
to 0 96 77
participate 0 96 77
in 0 96 77
public 0 96 77
meetings, 0 96 77
to 0 96 77
give 0 96 77
lectures, 0 96 77
to 0 96 77
travel, 0 96 77
with 0 96 77
the 0 96 77
obligation 0 96 77
of 0 96 77
dedicating 0 96 77
himself 0 96 77
to 0 96 77
a 0 96 77
life 0 96 77
of 0 96 77
prayer 0 96 77
and 0 96 77
penance.” 0 96 77
Viganò 0 96 77
further 0 96 77
reveals 0 96 77
that 0 96 77
those 0 96 77
sanctions 0 96 77
were 0 96 77
communicated 0 96 77
to 0 96 77
McCarrick 0 96 77
by 0 96 77
then 0 96 77
Apostolic 0 96 77
Nuncio 0 96 77
to 0 96 77
the 0 96 77
United 0 96 77
States, 0 96 77
Pietro 0 96 77
Sambi, 0 96 77
but 0 96 77
were 0 96 77
also 0 96 77
repeated 0 96 77
by 0 96 77
Viganò 0 96 77
himself 0 96 77
when 0 96 77
he 0 96 77
succeeded 0 96 77
Sambi 0 96 77
as 0 96 77
Nuncio: 0 96 77

I 0 96 78
repeated 0 96 78
them 0 96 78
to 0 96 78
Cardinal 0 96 78
McCarrick 0 96 78
at 0 96 78
my 0 96 78
first 0 96 78
meeting 0 96 78
with 0 96 78
him 0 96 78
at 0 96 78
the 0 96 78
Nunciature. 0 96 78

The 0 96 79
Cardinal, 0 96 79
muttering 1 96 79
in 1 96 79
a 1 96 79
barely 1 96 79
comprehensible 1 96 79
way, 1 96 79
admitted 0 96 79
that 0 96 79
he 0 96 79
had 0 96 79
perhaps 1 96 79
made 1 96 79
the 1 96 79
mistake 1 96 79
of 1 96 79
sleeping 1 96 79
in 1 96 79
the 1 96 79
same 1 96 79
bed 1 96 79
with 1 96 79
some 1 96 79
seminarians 1 96 79
at 1 96 79
his 1 96 79
beach 1 96 79
house, 1 96 79
but 0 96 79
he 0 96 79
said 0 96 79
this 0 96 79
as 0 96 79
if 0 96 79
it 0 96 79
had 0 96 79
no 0 96 79
importance. 0 96 79

Viganò 0 96 80
testifies 0 96 80
that 0 96 80
on 0 96 80
June 0 96 80
23, 0 96 80
2013, 0 96 80
he 0 96 80
obtained 0 96 80
a 0 96 80
private 0 96 80
audience 0 96 80
with 0 96 80
Bergoglio 0 96 80
after 0 96 80
having 0 96 80
encountered 0 96 80
McCarrick 0 96 80
at 0 96 80
the 0 96 80
Pope’s 0 96 80
residence 0 96 80
three 0 96 80
days 0 96 80
earlier, 0 96 80
during 0 96 80
which 0 96 80
encounter 0 96 80
McCarrick 0 96 80
had 0 96 80
told 0 96 80
him 0 96 80
with 0 96 80
an 0 96 80
air 0 96 80
of 0 96 80
triumph: 0 96 80
“The 0 96 80
Pope 0 96 80
received 0 96 80
me 0 96 80
yesterday, 0 96 80
tomorrow 0 96 80
I 0 96 80
am 0 96 80
going 0 96 80
to 0 96 80
China” 0 96 80
(evidently 0 96 80
to 0 96 80
assist 0 96 80
in 0 96 80
negotiating 0 96 80
Bergoglio’s 0 96 80
planned 1 96 80
sellout 1 96 80
of 0 96 80
China’s 1 96 80
underground 1 96 80
Catholics 1 96 80
to 0 96 80
the 0 96 80
Communist 1 96 80
dictators 1 96 80
of 1 96 80
Beijing). 1 96 80

Viganò 0 96 81
wanted 0 96 81
to 0 96 81
know 0 96 81
why 0 96 81
McCarrick 0 96 81
had 0 96 81
apparently 0 96 81
been 0 96 81
relieved 0 96 81
of 0 96 81
the 0 96 81
sanctions. 0 96 81

During 0 96 82
the 0 96 82
audience 0 96 82
Bergoglio 0 96 82
queried: 0 96 82
“What 0 96 82
is 0 96 82
Cardinal 0 96 82
McCarrick 0 96 82
like?” 0 96 82
and 0 96 82
Viganò 0 96 82
replied 0 96 82
with 0 96 82
the 0 96 82
truth 0 96 82
Bergoglio 0 96 82
obviously 0 96 82
did 0 96 82
not 0 96 82
want 0 96 82
to 0 96 82
hear: 0 96 82

I 0 96 83
answered 0 96 83
him 0 96 83
with 0 96 83
complete 0 96 83
frankness 0 96 83
and, 0 96 83
if 0 96 83
you 0 96 83
want, 0 96 83
with 0 96 83
great 0 96 83
naiveté: 0 96 83
“Holy 0 96 83
Father, 0 96 83
I 0 96 83
don’t 0 96 83
know 0 96 83
if 0 96 83
you 0 96 83
know 0 96 83
Cardinal 0 96 83
McCarrick, 0 96 83
but 0 96 83
if 0 96 83
you 0 96 83
ask 0 96 83
the 0 96 83
Congregation 0 96 83
for 0 96 83
Bishops 0 96 83
there 0 96 83
is 0 96 83
a 0 96 83
dossier 0 96 83
this 0 96 83
thick 0 96 83
about 0 96 83
him. 0 96 83

He 0 96 84
corrupted 0 96 84
generations 0 96 84
of 0 96 84
seminarians 0 96 84
and 0 96 84
priests 0 96 84
and 0 96 84
Pope 0 96 84
Benedict 0 96 84
ordered 0 96 84
him 0 96 84
to 0 96 84
withdraw 0 96 84
to 0 96 84
a 0 96 84
life 0 96 84
of 0 96 84
prayer 0 96 84
and 0 96 84
penance.” 0 96 84
The 0 96 84
Pope 0 96 84
did 0 96 84
not 0 96 84
make 0 96 84
the 0 96 84
slightest 0 96 84
comment 0 96 84
about 0 96 84
those 0 96 84
very 1 96 84
grave 1 96 84
words 1 96 84
of 1 96 84
mine 1 96 84
and 0 96 84
did 0 96 84
not 0 96 84
show 0 96 84
any 0 96 84
expression 0 96 84
of 0 96 84
surprise 0 96 84
on 0 96 84
his 0 96 84
face, 0 96 84
as 0 96 84
if 0 96 84
he 0 96 84
had 0 96 84
already 0 96 84
known 0 96 84
the 0 96 84
matter 0 96 84
for 0 96 84
some 0 96 84
time, 0 96 84
and 0 96 84
he 0 96 84
immediately 0 96 84
changed 0 96 84
the 0 96 84
subject. 0 96 84

But 0 96 85
then, 0 96 85
what 0 96 85
was 0 96 85
the 0 96 85
Pope’s 0 96 85
purpose 0 96 85
in 0 96 85
asking 0 96 85
me 0 96 85
that 0 96 85
question: 0 96 85
“What 0 96 85
is 0 96 85
Cardinal 0 96 85
McCarrick 0 96 85

not…. 1 96 85

It 0 96 86
was 0 96 86
also 0 96 86
clear 0 96 86
that, 0 96 86
from 0 96 86
the 0 96 86
time 0 96 86
of 0 96 86
Pope 0 96 86

McCarrick, 0 96 86
now 0 96 86
free 0 96 86
from 0 96 86
all 0 96 86
constraints, 0 96 86
had 0 96 86

He 0 96 87
[Bergoglio] 0 96 87
knew 0 96 87
from 0 96 87
at 0 96 87

June 0 96 87
23, 0 96 87
2013 0 96 87
[the 0 96 87

of 0 96 87
the 0 96 87

with 0 96 87
Viganò] 0 96 87
that 0 96 87
McCarrick 0 96 87
was 0 96 87
a 1 96 87
serial 1 96 87
predator. 1 96 87

Although 0 96 88
he 0 96 88
knew 0 96 88
that 0 96 88
he 0 96 88
was 0 96 88
a 0 96 88
corrupt 1 96 88
man, 1 96 88
he 0 96 88
covered 0 96 88
for 0 96 88
him 0 96 88
to 1 96 88
the 1 96 88
bitter 1 96 88
end; 1 96 88
indeed, 0 96 88
he 0 96 88
made 0 96 88
McCarrick’s 0 96 88
advice 0 96 88
his 0 96 88
own, 0 96 88
which 0 96 88
was 0 96 88
certainly 0 96 88
not 0 96 88
inspired 0 96 88
by 0 96 88
sound 0 96 88
intentions 0 96 88
and 0 96 88
for 0 96 88
love 0 96 88
of 0 96 88
the 0 96 88
Church. 0 96 88

It 0 96 89
was 0 96 89
only 0 96 89
when 0 96 89
he 0 96 89
was 0 96 89
forced 0 96 89
by 0 96 89
the 0 96 89
report 0 96 89
of 0 96 89
the 0 96 89
abuse 0 96 89

on 0 96 89
the 0 96 89
basis 0 96 89
of 0 96 89
media 0 96 89
attention, 0 96 89
that 0 96 89
he 0 96 89
took 0 96 89
action 0 96 89
to 0 96 89
save 0 96 89
his 0 96 89

[all 0 96 90

Before 0 96 91
his 0 96 91
long 0 96 91
overdue 0 96 91
fall 0 96 91
McCarrick, 0 96 91
as 0 96 91
Bergoglio’s 1 96 91
“trusted 1 96 91
counselor,” 1 96 91
had 0 96 91
been 0 96 91
instrumental 0 96 91
in 0 96 91
cementing 0 96 91
into 0 96 91
place 0 96 91
the 0 96 91
homosexual-friendly 0 96 91
status 0 96 91
quo 0 96 91
of 0 96 91
the 0 96 91
American 0 96 91
episcopate 0 96 91
that 0 96 91
oppresses 0 96 91
and 0 96 91
defrauds 0 96 91
the 0 96 91
faithful. 0 96 91

It 0 96 92
was 0 96 92
McCarrick, 0 96 92
noted 0 96 92
Marco 0 96 92
Tosatti, 0 96 92
who 0 96 92
was 0 96 92
behind 0 96 92
the 0 96 92
elevation 0 96 92
of 0 96 92
Blase 0 96 92
Cupich 0 96 92
to 0 96 92
the 0 96 92
key 0 96 92
position 0 96 92
of 0 96 92
Archbishop 0 96 92
of 0 96 92
Chicago, 0 96 92
where 0 96 92
Cupich 0 96 92
has 0 96 92
since 0 96 92
promoted 0 96 92
the 0 96 92

of 0 96 92
Father 0 96 92
James 0 96 92
Martin. 0 96 92

And 0 96 93
Viganò 0 96 93
now 0 96 93
confirms 0 96 93
Tosatti’s 0 96 93
allegation: 0 96 93
“The 0 96 93

That 0 96 94
is, 0 96 94
the 0 96 94
normal 0 96 94
process 0 96 94
was 0 96 94
circumvented 0 96 94
for 0 96 94
these 0 96 94
appointments. 0 96 94

Remnant 0 96 95
readers 0 96 95
may 0 96 95
recall 0 96 95
that 0 96 95
I 0 96 95
spotted 0 96 95
Cupich 0 96 95
back 0 96 95
in 0 96 95
2002, 0 96 95
when 0 96 95
he 0 96 95
was 0 96 95
the 1 96 95
obscure 1 96 95
Bishop 1 96 95
of 1 96 95
Rapid 1 96 95
City, 1 96 95
South 0 96 95
Dakota, 0 96 95
as 0 96 95
an 0 96 95
example 0 96 95
of 0 96 95
what 0 96 95
was 0 96 95
coming 0 96 95
in 0 96 95
the 0 96 95
Novus 0 96 95
Ordo: 0 96 95
accelerated 1 96 95
degeneration. 1 96 95

As 0 96 96
I 0 96 96
wrote 0 96 96
back 0 96 96
then, 0 96 96
with 0 96 96
the 0 96 96
likes 0 96 96
of 0 96 96
Cupich 0 96 96
in 0 96 96
view: 0 96 96

Cupich 0 96 97
is 0 96 97
the 0 96 97
very 0 96 97
model 0 96 97
of 0 96 97
a 0 96 97
Novus 0 96 97
Ordo 0 96 97
bishop. 0 96 97

He 1 96 98
is 1 96 98
the 1 96 98
very 1 96 98
exemplar 1 96 98
of 1 96 98
the 1 96 98
crisis 1 96 98
we 1 96 98
must 1 96 98
still 1 96 98
endure…. 1 96 98

Let 0 96 99
the 0 96 99
thing 0 96 99
die 0 96 99
of 0 96 99
its 0 96 99
own 0 96 99
excesses, 0 96 99
for 0 96 99
as 0 96 99
the 0 96 99
“little 0 96 99

[the 1 96 99

the 1 96 99
men 1 96 99
who 1 96 99
control 1 96 99
this 1 96 99

will 1 96 99
never 1 96 99
restore 1 96 99
it 1 96 99
to 1 96 99
anything 1 96 99
resembling 1 96 99
the 1 96 99

that 1 96 99

For 1 96 100
heaven’s 1 96 100
sake, 1 96 100
the 0 96 100
men 0 96 100
who 0 96 100
govern 0 96 100
the 0 96 100

to 0 96 100

over 1 96 100
whether 0 96 100

should 0 96 100
be 0 96 100
defrocked. 0 96 100

From 0 96 101
the 0 96 101
Vatican 0 96 101
on 0 96 101
down, 0 96 101
through 0 96 101
deliberate 0 96 101
decisions 0 96 101
and 0 96 101
criminal 0 96 101
neglect, 0 96 101
the 1 96 101
servitors 1 96 101
of 1 96 101
Vatican 1 96 101
II 1 96 101
have 1 96 101
laid 1 96 101
waste 1 96 101
to 0 96 101
the 0 96 101

the 0 96 101
perennial 0 96 101
clarity 0 96 101
of 0 96 101

of 0 96 101
the 0 96 101

in 0 96 101
their 0 96 101

short, 0 96 101
the 0 96 101
very 0 96 101
life 0 96 101
of 0 96 101

dare 0 96 101
to 0 96 101
call 0 96 101
it 0 96 101
a 0 96 101
renewal. 0 96 101

We 1 96 102
must 1 96 102
no 1 96 102
longer 1 96 102
subsidize 1 96 102
the 1 96 102
malpractice 1 96 102
of 1 96 102
the 1 96 102
architects 1 96 102
of 1 96 102
ruin. 1 96 102

Nor 1 96 103
must 1 96 103
we 1 96 103
join 1 96 103
the 1 96 103
neo-Catholics 1 96 103
in 1 96 103
their 1 96 103
mindless 1 96 103
applause 1 96 103
when 1 96 103
one 1 96 103
of 1 96 103
these 1 96 103
incompetents 1 96 103
attempts 1 96 103
to 1 96 103
repoint 1 96 103
a 1 96 103
brick 1 96 103
or 1 96 103
two 1 96 103
in 1 96 103
the 1 96 103

erected 1 96 103
to 1 96 103
obscure 1 96 103
the 1 96 103
Church 1 96 103
of 1 96 103
old. 1 96 103

As 0 96 104
for 0 96 104
William 1 96 104
(“nighty-night 1 96 104
baby!”) 1 96 104
Tobin, 1 96 104
after 0 96 104
McCarrick 0 96 104
had 0 96 104
arranged 0 96 104
for 0 96 104
him 0 96 104
to 0 96 104
become 0 96 104
Archbishop 0 96 104
of 0 96 104
Newark, 0 96 104
Tobin, 0 96 104
another 1 96 104
episcopal 1 96 104
booster 1 96 104
of 1 96 104
Martin’s 1 96 104
pro-homosexual 1 96 104
propaganda, 1 96 104
promptly 0 96 104
sponsored 0 96 104
a 0 96 104
“gay 0 96 104
pilgrimage” 0 96 104
to 0 96 104
his 0 96 104
cathedral 0 96 104
in 0 96 104
Newark. 0 96 104

And 0 96 105
it 0 96 105
was 0 96 105
McCarrick 0 96 105
who 0 96 105
obtained 0 96 105
the 0 96 105
cardinal’s 0 96 105
hat 0 96 105
for 0 96 105

years, 0 96 105
Kevin 0 96 105
Farrell, 0 96 105
whom 0 96 105
he 0 96 105
consecrated 0 96 105
a 0 96 105
bishop. 0 96 105

Farrell, 0 96 106
yet 1 96 106
another 1 96 106
promoter 1 96 106
of 1 96 106
Martin’s 1 96 106
homosexual 1 96 106
activism, 1 96 106
arranged 0 96 106
for 0 96 106
Martin 0 96 106
to 0 96 106
“welcome 0 96 106

just 0 96 106
returned. 0 96 106

Finally, 0 96 107
there 0 96 107
is 0 96 107
the 0 96 107
appointment 0 96 107
of 0 96 107

Cupich, 0 96 107
Tobin 0 96 107
and 0 96 107
Farrell, 0 96 107
McElroy 0 96 107
is 0 96 107
an 1 96 107
avid 1 96 107
promoter 1 96 107
of 1 96 107
Martin’s 1 96 107
homosexual 1 96 107
subversion 1 96 107
of 1 96 107
the 1 96 107
Church, 1 96 107
calling 0 96 107
opposition 0 96 107
to 0 96 107
Martin 0 96 107
symptomatic 0 96 107
of 0 96 107
a 0 96 107
“cancer 1 96 107

Emboldened 0 96 108
by 0 96 108
the 0 96 108
certainty 0 96 108
that 0 96 108
he 0 96 108
will 0 96 108
face 0 96 108
no 0 96 108
discipline 0 96 108
whatsoever, 0 96 108
Martin, 0 96 108
now 0 96 108
backed 0 96 108
by 0 96 108
“Cupich, 0 96 108
Tobin, 0 96 108
Farrell 0 96 108
and 0 96 108
McElroy,” 0 96 108
as 0 96 108
Viganò 0 96 108
testifies, 0 96 108
is 0 96 108
urging 0 96 108
all 0 96 108
the 0 96 108
“gay 0 96 108
priests” 0 96 108
to 0 96 108
“come 0 96 108
out,” 0 96 108
including 0 96 108
those 0 96 108
ordained 0 96 108
since 0 96 108
the 0 96 108
useless 0 96 108
“pedophile 1 96 108
summit” 1 96 108
presided 0 96 108
over 0 96 108
by 0 96 108
none 0 96 108
other 0 96 108
than 0 96 108
McCarrick 0 96 108
as 0 96 108
the 1 96 108
classic 1 96 108
fox 1 96 108
in 1 96 108
charge 1 96 108
of 1 96 108
the 1 96 108
hen 1 96 108
house. 1 96 108

But 0 96 109
Bergoglio 0 96 109
has 0 96 109
also 0 96 109
lent 0 96 109
his 0 96 109
own 0 96 109
authority 0 96 109
to 0 96 109
Martin’s 0 96 109
effort 0 96 109
to 0 96 109
mainstream 0 96 109
homosexuality 0 96 109
in 0 96 109
the 0 96 109
Church. 0 96 109

As 0 96 110
Viganò 0 96 110
notes, 0 96 110
it 0 96 110
was 0 96 110
Bergoglio 0 96 110
who 0 96 110
made 0 96 110
Martin 0 96 110
a 0 96 110
“Consultor 0 96 110
of 0 96 110
the 0 96 110
Secretariat 0 96 110
for 0 96 110
Communications,” 0 96 110
even 0 96 110
though 0 96 110
he 0 96 110
is 0 96 110
a 1 96 110
“well-known 1 96 110
activist 1 96 110
who 1 96 110
promotes 1 96 110
the 1 96 110
LGBT 1 96 110
agenda, 1 96 110
chosen 1 96 110
to 1 96 110
corrupt 1 96 110
the 1 96 110
young 1 96 110
people 1 96 110
who 1 96 110
will 1 96 110
soon 1 96 110
gather 1 96 110
in 1 96 110
Dublin 1 96 110
for 1 96 110
the 1 96 110
World 1 96 110
Meeting 1 96 110
of 1 96 110
Families…” 1 96 110

“Father” 0 96 111
Martin 0 96 111
now 0 96 111
confidently 0 96 111
declares, 0 96 111
sixteen 0 96 111
years 0 96 111
after 0 96 111
the 0 96 111
“pedophile 1 96 111
summit,” 1 96 111
that 0 96 111
“The 1 96 111
idea 1 96 111
of 1 96 111
a 1 96 111
purge 1 96 111
of 1 96 111
gay 1 96 111
priests 1 96 111
is 1 96 111
both 1 96 111
ridiculous 1 96 111
and 1 96 111
dangerous. 1 96 111

Any 1 96 112
purge 1 96 112
would 1 96 112
empty 1 96 112
parishes 1 96 112
and 1 96 112
religious 1 96 112
orders 1 96 112
of 1 96 112
the 1 96 112
thousands 1 96 112
of 1 96 112
priests 1 96 112
and 1 96 112
bishops 1 96 112
who 1 96 112
lead 1 96 112
healthy 1 96 112
lives 1 96 112
of 1 96 112
service 1 96 112
and 1 96 112
faithful 1 96 112
lives 1 96 112
of 1 96 112
celibacy.” 1 96 112

Martin 0 96 113
thus 0 96 113
revels 1 96 113
in 1 96 113
smug 1 96 113
certitude 1 96 113
that 0 96 113
the 0 96 113
future 0 96 113
of 0 96 113
the 0 96 113
universal 0 96 113
Church 0 96 113
is 0 96 113
in 0 96 113
the 0 96 113
hands 0 96 113
of 0 96 113
legions 1 96 113
of 1 96 113
intrinsically 1 96 113
disordered 1 96 113
homosexual 1 96 113
bishops 1 96 113
and 1 96 113
priests 1 96 113
and 0 96 113
their 0 96 113
homosexual 0 96 113
successors, 0 96 113
who 0 96 113
will 0 96 113
perpetuate 0 96 113
an 0 96 113
existing 0 96 113
worldwide 0 96 113
homosexual 0 96 113
network, 0 96 113
and 0 96 113
that 0 96 113
there 0 96 113
is 0 96 113
absolutely 0 96 113
nothing 0 96 113
we 0 96 113
can 0 96 113
or 0 96 113
should 0 96 113
do 0 96 113
about 0 96 113
it. 0 96 113

A 0 96 114
Worldwide 0 96 114
Network 0 96 114
of 0 96 114
Corruption, 0 96 114
Beginning 0 96 114
at 0 96 114
the 0 96 114
Top 0 96 114

None 0 96 115
of 0 96 115
the 0 96 115
foregoing 0 96 115
is 0 96 115
meant 0 96 115
to 0 96 115
suggest 0 96 115
that 0 96 115
the 0 96 115
homosexual 0 96 115
invasion 0 96 115
of 0 96 115
the 0 96 115
Catholic 0 96 115
hierarchy 0 96 115
is 0 96 115
confined 0 96 115
to 0 96 115
American 0 96 115
prelates 0 96 115
and 0 96 115
priests. 0 96 115

The 0 96 116
spread 0 96 116
of 0 96 116
clerical 1 96 116
sodomy 1 96 116
has 0 96 116
not 0 96 116
respected 0 96 116
national 0 96 116
boundaries 0 96 116
but 0 96 116
rather 0 96 116
extends 0 96 116
throughout 0 96 116
the 0 96 116
Church 0 96 116
under 0 96 116
the 0 96 116
eyes 0 96 116
of 0 96 116
a 0 96 116
Vatican 0 96 116
apparatus 0 96 116
that 0 96 116
is 0 96 116
itself 0 96 116
thoroughly 1 96 116
infested 1 96 116
with 1 96 116
homosexuals. 1 96 116

This 0 96 117
is 0 96 117
thanks 0 96 117
in 0 96 117
large 0 96 117
measure 0 96 117
to 0 96 117
Bergoglio, 0 96 117
who 0 96 117
made 0 96 117
a 1 96 117
flagrantly 1 96 117
active 1 96 117
homosexual, 1 96 117
Monsignor 0 96 117
Battista 0 96 117
Ricca, 0 96 117
“prelate 1 96 117
of 1 96 117
the 1 96 117
gay 1 96 117
lobby,” 1 96 117
no 0 96 117
less 0 96 117
than 0 96 117
head 0 96 117
of 0 96 117
his 0 96 117
papal 0 96 117
household. 0 96 117

Moreover, 0 96 118
it 0 96 118
was 0 96 118
Bergoglio’s 0 96 118
right 0 96 118
hand 0 96 118
man, 0 96 118
Cardinal 0 96 118
Maradiaga, 0 96 118
who 0 96 118
sheltered 0 96 118
his 0 96 118
friend, 0 96 118
Juan 0 96 118
José 0 96 118
Pineda, 0 96 118
auxiliary 0 96 118
Bishop 0 96 118
of 0 96 118
Tegucigalpa, 0 96 118
from 0 96 118
any 0 96 118
discipline 0 96 118
over 0 96 118
his 0 96 118
notorious 0 96 118
homosexual 0 96 118
liaisons 0 96 118
with 0 96 118
seminarians 0 96 118
in 0 96 118
that 0 96 118
diocese. 0 96 118

When 0 96 119
an 0 96 119
apostolic 0 96 119
visitation, 0 96 119
compelled 0 96 119
by 0 96 119
mounting 0 96 119
public 0 96 119
pressure, 0 96 119
confirmed 0 96 119
the 0 96 119
charges 0 96 119
against 0 96 119
Pineda, 0 96 119
he 0 96 119
was 0 96 119
forced 0 96 119
to 0 96 119
resign, 0 96 119
even 0 96 119
as 0 96 119
Maradiaga 0 96 119
dismissed 0 96 119
the 0 96 119
incontestable 0 96 119
proofs 0 96 119
against 0 96 119
him 0 96 119
as 0 96 119
“slander.” 0 96 119
Viganò 0 96 119
notes 0 96 119
that 0 96 119
“the 0 96 119
only 0 96 119
thing 0 96 119
that 0 96 119
has 0 96 119
been 0 96 119
made 0 96 119
public 0 96 119
is 0 96 119
that 0 96 119
his 0 96 119
resignation 0 96 119
has 0 96 119
simply 0 96 119
been 0 96 119
accepted, 0 96 119
thus 0 96 119
making 0 96 119
any 0 96 119
possible 0 96 119
responsibility 0 96 119
of 0 96 119
his 0 96 119
and 0 96 119
Maradiaga 0 96 119
vanish 1 96 119
into 1 96 119
nowhere.” 1 96 119

Despite 0 96 120
the 0 96 120
fall 0 96 120
of 0 96 120
his 0 96 120
friend 0 96 120
Pineda, 0 96 120
Maradiaga 0 96 120
continues 0 96 120
todefend 0 96 120
and 0 96 120
protect 0 96 120
the 0 96 120
homosexual 0 96 120
corruption 0 96 120
of 0 96 120
his 0 96 120
own 0 96 120
seminary, 0 96 120
involving 0 96 120
incontrovertible 0 96 120
evidence 0 96 120
of 0 96 120
rampant 1 96 120
sodomy 1 96 120
among 0 96 120
the 0 96 120
seminarians 0 96 120
he 0 96 120
refuses 0 96 120
to 0 96 120
dismiss, 0 96 120
rejecting 0 96 120
all 0 96 120
the 0 96 120
evidence 0 96 120
as 0 96 120
“gossip.” 0 96 120
Concerning 0 96 120
Maradiaga, 0 96 120
who 0 96 120
is 0 96 120
also 0 96 120
mired 1 96 120
in 1 96 120
financial 1 96 120
corruption 1 96 120
for 0 96 120
which 0 96 120
he 0 96 120
offers 0 96 120
no 0 96 120
credible 0 96 120
explanation, 0 96 120
Viganò 0 96 120
provides 0 96 120
this 1 96 120
withering 1 96 120
assessment 1 96 120
of 0 96 120
the 0 96 120
man 0 96 120
and 0 96 120
his 0 96 120
relation 0 96 120
to 0 96 120
Bergoglio: 0 96 120

In 0 96 121
a 0 96 121
team 0 96 121
effort 0 96 121
with 0 96 121
Cardinal 0 96 121
Rodriguez 0 96 121
Maradiaga, 0 96 121
[McCarrick] 0 96 121
had 0 96 121
become 0 96 121
the 1 96 121
kingmaker 1 96 121
for 0 96 121
appointments 0 96 121
in 0 96 121

with 0 96 121
the 0 96 121

administration. 0 96 121

This 0 96 122
is 0 96 122
how 0 96 122
one 0 96 122
explains 0 96 122
that, 0 96 122
as 0 96 122
members 0 96 122
of 0 96 122
the 0 96 122
Congregation 0 96 122
for 0 96 122

now 0 96 123
the 0 96 123

to 0 96 124
the 0 96 124
bitter 0 96 124
end, 0 96 124
as 0 96 124

he 0 96 125
insulted 0 96 125
the 0 96 125

recognize 0 96 126

error 0 96 126
and 0 96 126
apologize, 0 96 126
while 0 96 126
stating 0 96 126
that 0 96 126

had 0 96 126

Today, 0 96 138
our 0 96 138
ridiculous 0 96 138
suggestion 0 96 138
is 0 96 138
the 0 96 138
stuff 0 96 138
of 0 96 138
mainstream 0 96 138

From 0 96 139
the 0 96 139
neo-Catholic 0 96 139
perspective, 0 96 139
the 0 96 139
events 0 96 139
of 0 96 139
recent 0 96 139
days 0 96 139
present 0 96 139
a 0 96 139
terrifying 1 96 139
prospect: 1 96 139
the 0 96 139
final 0 96 139
collapse 0 96 139
of 0 96 139
the 0 96 139
Novus 0 96 139
Ordo 0 96 139
establishment, 0 96 139
an 0 96 139
end 0 96 139
to 0 96 139
the 0 96 139
conciliar 0 96 139
aggiornamento 0 96 139
and 0 96 139
a 0 96 139
revival 0 96 139
of 0 96 139
integral 0 96 139
Tradition, 0 96 139
which 0 96 139
growing 0 96 139
numbers 0 96 139
of 0 96 139
young 0 96 139
people 0 96 139
are 0 96 139
seeking. 0 96 139

Hence 0 96 140
even 0 96 140
before 0 96 140
Archbishop 0 96 140
Viganò 0 96 140
had 0 96 140
come 0 96 140
forward, 0 96 140
commentators 0 96 140
like 0 96 140
Faggioli 0 96 140
were 0 96 140
already 0 96 140
sounding 1 96 140
the 1 96 140
neo-Catholic 1 96 140
air 1 96 140
raid 1 96 140
siren. 1 96 140

Faggioli 0 96 141
fretted 1 96 141
that 0 96 141
“[t]he 0 96 141
abuse 0 96 141
scandal 0 96 141
and 0 96 141
delegitimization 0 96 141
of 0 96 141
the 0 96 141
episcopate 0 96 141
has 0 96 141
created 0 96 141
a 0 96 141
great 0 96 141
power 0 96 141
vacuum 0 96 141
in 0 96 141
the 0 96 141
Church” 0 96 141
that 0 96 141
could 0 96 141
be 0 96 141
filled 0 96 141
by 0 96 141
the 0 96 141
“neo-traditionalist 0 96 141
Catholicism 0 96 141
of 0 96 141
the 0 96 141
younger 0 96 141
generations 0 96 141
of 0 96 141
American 0 96 141
Catholics” 0 96 141
who 0 96 141
“attack 0 96 141
American 0 96 141
bishops 0 96 141
and 0 96 141
cardinals 0 96 141
close 0 96 141
to 0 96 141
Pope 0 96 141
Francis.” 0 96 141
Accordingly, 0 96 141
he 0 96 141
rushed 0 96 141
to 0 96 141
the 0 96 141
defense 0 96 141
of 0 96 141
Bergoglio 0 96 141
and 0 96 141
his 1 96 141
corrupt 1 96 141
regime 1 96 141
against 0 96 141
“a 0 96 141
radicalization 0 96 141
of 0 96 141
religious 0 96 141
conservatism 0 96 141
in 0 96 141
the 0 96 141
neo-traditionalism 0 96 141
sense...” 0 96 141

For 1 96 142
Faggioli, 1 96 142
not 1 96 142
only 1 96 142
would 1 96 142
Bergoglio’s 1 96 142
resignation 1 96 142
be 1 96 142
unthinkable, 1 96 142
so 1 96 142
also 1 96 142
would 1 96 142
a 1 96 142
purge 1 96 142
of 1 96 142
the 1 96 142
homosexual 1 96 142
and 1 96 142
pro-homosexual 1 96 142
prelates 1 96 142
Bergoglio 1 96 142
and 1 96 142
his 1 96 142
Vatican 1 96 142
henchmen 1 96 142
have 1 96 142
systematically 1 96 142
enabled. 1 96 142

The 0 96 143
Pope, 0 96 143
he 0 96 143
argues, 0 96 143
is 0 96 143
not 0 96 143
“the 1 96 143

No, 0 96 143
Bergoglio 0 96 143

Except 0 96 144
whenever 0 96 144
he 0 96 144
pleases, 0 96 144
as 0 96 144
we 0 96 144
have 0 96 144
seen 0 96 144
again 0 96 144
and 0 96 144
again 0 96 144
with 0 96 144
the 1 96 144
conservative 1 96 144
bishops 1 96 144
and 1 96 144
even 1 96 144
Cardinals 1 96 144
(Burke 1 96 144
and 1 96 144
Müller) 1 96 144
he 1 96 144
has 1 96 144
sacked 1 96 144
because 1 96 144
their 1 96 144
conservatism 1 96 144
offended 1 96 144
him 1 96 144
or 1 96 144
one 1 96 144
of 1 96 144
his 1 96 144
friends, 1 96 144
prompting 0 96 144
even 0 96 144
Crux 0 96 144
to 0 96 144
ask: 0 96 144
“Does 1 96 144
Pope 1 96 144
Francis 1 96 144
have 1 96 144
an 1 96 144
enemies 1 96 144
list?” 1 96 144
Then 0 96 144
again, 0 96 144
Francis 0 96 144
even 0 96 144
obtained 0 96 144
the 0 96 144
removal 0 96 144
of 0 96 144
his 0 96 144
own 0 96 144
“trusted 1 96 144
counselor” 1 96 144
McCarrick 1 96 144
from 0 96 144
the 0 96 144
College 0 96 144
of 0 96 144
Cardinals, 0 96 144
albeit 0 96 144
only 0 96 144
when 0 96 144
forced 0 96 144
to 0 96 144
act 0 96 144
due 0 96 144
to 0 96 144
worldwide 0 96 144
condemnation 0 96 144
in 0 96 144
the 0 96 144
media. 0 96 144

So, 0 96 145
according 0 96 145
to 0 96 145
Faggioli, 0 96 145
the 1 96 145
same 1 96 145
Pope 1 96 145
who 1 96 145
sacks 1 96 145
conservative 1 96 145
bishops 1 96 145
and 1 96 145
cardinals 1 96 145
according 1 96 145
to 1 96 145
his 1 96 145
pleasure 1 96 145
and 1 96 145
has 1 96 145
just 1 96 145
removed 1 96 145
a 1 96 145
cardinal 1 96 145
from 1 96 145
the 1 96 145
College 1 96 145
of 1 96 145
Cardinals 1 96 145
in 1 96 145
an 1 96 145
unprecedented 1 96 145
disciplinary 1 96 145
act 1 96 145
under 1 96 145
fire 1 96 145
from 1 96 145
the 1 96 145
media, 1 96 145
is 1 96 145
somehow 1 96 145
powerless 1 96 145
to 1 96 145
dismiss 1 96 145
Modernist 1 96 145
bishops 1 96 145
who 1 96 145
have 1 96 145
created 1 96 145
an 1 96 145
obscene 1 96 145
“gay 1 96 145
culture” 1 96 145
in 1 96 145
the 1 96 145
Church 1 96 145
and 1 96 145
replace 1 96 145
them 1 96 145
with 1 96 145
orthodox, 1 96 145
normal 1 96 145
heterosexual 1 96 145
males. 1 96 145

Francis 1 96 146
cannot 1 96 146
“simply 1 96 146
fire” 1 96 146
even 1 96 146
Cardinal 1 96 146
Wuerl, 1 96 146
who 1 96 146
covered 1 96 146
up 1 96 146
crimes 1 96 146
of 1 96 146
homosexual 1 96 146
predation 1 96 146
by 1 96 146
the 1 96 146
priests 1 96 146
he 1 96 146
transferred 1 96 146
elsewhere 1 96 146
while 1 96 146
Archbishop 1 96 146
of 1 96 146
Pittsburgh, 1 96 146
and 1 96 146
who 1 96 146
authorized 1 96 146
payment 1 96 146
of 1 96 146
$900,000 1 96 146
in 1 96 146
hush 1 96 146
money 1 96 146
to 1 96 146
bury 1 96 146
sexual 1 96 146

claims 1 96 146
against 1 96 146
a 1 96 146
homosexual 1 96 146
priest 1 96 146
involved 1 96 146
in 1 96 146
the 1 96 146
production 1 96 146
of 1 96 146
child 1 96 146
pornography. 1 96 146

Wuerl, 0 96 147
says 0 96 147
Faggioli, 0 96 147
“faces 0 96 147
a 0 96 147
complex 0 96 147
situation: 0 96 147
on 0 96 147
the 0 96 147
one 0 96 147
hand 0 96 147
Wuerl 0 96 147
was 0 96 147
not 0 96 147
afraid 0 96 147
of 0 96 147
clashing 0 96 147
with 0 96 147
the 0 96 147
tribunal 0 96 147
over 0 96 147
the 0 96 147
Apostolic 0 96 147
Signatura 0 96 147
in 0 96 147
the 0 96 147
Vatican 0 96 147
which 0 96 147
wanted 0 96 147
to 0 96 147
readmit 0 96 147
a 0 96 147
priest 0 96 147
from 0 96 147
the 0 96 147
Pittsburgh 0 96 147
diocese 0 96 147
to 0 96 147
ministry… 0 96 147
while 0 96 147
in 0 96 147
other 0 96 147
cases 0 96 147
he 0 96 147
seems 0 96 147
to 0 96 147
have 0 96 147
collaborated 0 96 147
in 0 96 147
covering 0 96 147
up 0 96 147
some 0 96 147
cases… 0 96 147
It 0 96 147
is 0 96 147
a 0 96 147
very 0 96 147
difficult 0 96 147
position 0 96 147
also 0 96 147
because 0 96 147
Wuerl 0 96 147
became 0 96 147
a 0 96 147
symbol… 0 96 147
beyond 0 96 147
the 0 96 147
specific 0 96 147
accusations 0 96 147
against 0 96 147
him, 0 96 147
from 0 96 147
which 0 96 147
he 0 96 147
could 0 96 147
not 0 96 147
publicly 0 96 147
defend 0 96 147
himself.” 0 96 147

In 0 96 148
other 0 96 148
words, 0 96 148
because 0 96 148
his 0 96 148
situation 0 96 148
is 0 96 148
“complex” 0 96 148
Wuerl, 0 96 148
unlike 0 96 148
McCarrick, 0 96 148
should 0 96 148
remain 0 96 148
a 0 96 148
cardinal 0 96 148
and 0 96 148
the 0 96 148
Archbishop 0 96 148
of 0 96 148
Washington, 0 96 148
DC, 0 96 148
thus 0 96 148
maintaining 1 96 148
a 1 96 148
key 1 96 148
bulwark 1 96 148
against 1 96 148
the 1 96 148
“neo-traditionalist” 1 96 148
threat. 1 96 148

Yet, 0 96 149
as 0 96 149
the 0 96 149
Pennsylvania 0 96 149
grand 0 96 149
jury 0 96 149
report 0 96 149
documents, 0 96 149
Wuerl 0 96 149
assisted 0 96 149
McCarrick 0 96 149
in 0 96 149
the 0 96 149
coverup 0 96 149
of 0 96 149
his 0 96 149
crimes 0 96 149
and 0 96 149
now 0 96 149
brazenly 1 96 149
lies 1 96 149
about 1 96 149
it. 1 96 149

Here 0 96 150
too 0 96 150
Viganò’s 0 96 150
testimony 0 96 150
sheds 1 96 150
light 1 96 150
on 1 96 150
the 1 96 150
darkness: 1 96 150

…. 0 96 151

I 0 96 152
myself 0 96 152
brought 0 96 152
up 0 96 152
the 0 96 152
subject 0 96 152
[of 0 96 152
McCarrick] 0 96 152
with 0 96 152
Cardinal 0 96 152
Wuerl 0 96 152
on 0 96 152
several 0 96 152
occasions, 0 96 152
and 0 96 152
I 0 96 152
certainly 0 96 152
didn’t 0 96 152
need 0 96 152
to 0 96 152
go 0 96 152
into 0 96 152
detail 0 96 152
because 0 96 152
it 0 96 152
was 0 96 152
immediately 0 96 152
clear 0 96 152
to 0 96 152
me 0 96 152
that 0 96 152
he 0 96 152
was 0 96 152
fully 0 96 152
aware 0 96 152
of 0 96 152
it. 0 96 152

I 0 96 153
also 0 96 153
remember 0 96 153
in 0 96 153
particular 0 96 153
the 0 96 153
fact 0 96 153
that 0 96 153
I 0 96 153
had 0 96 153
to 0 96 153
draw 0 96 153
his 0 96 153
attention 0 96 153
to 0 96 153
it, 0 96 153
because 0 96 153
I 0 96 153
realized 0 96 153
that 0 96 153
in 0 96 153
an 0 96 153
archdiocesan 0 96 153
publication, 0 96 153
on 0 96 153
the 0 96 153
back 0 96 153
cover 0 96 153
in 0 96 153
color, 0 96 153
there 0 96 153
was 0 96 153
an 0 96 153
announcement 0 96 153
inviting 0 96 153
young 0 96 153
men 0 96 153
who 0 96 153
thought 0 96 153
they 0 96 153
had 0 96 153
a 0 96 153
vocation 0 96 153
to 0 96 153
the 0 96 153
priesthood 0 96 153
to 0 96 153
a 0 96 153
meeting 0 96 153
with 0 96 153
Cardinal 0 96 153
McCarrick. 0 96 153

I 0 96 154
immediately 0 96 154
phoned 0 96 154
Cardinal 0 96 154
Wuerl, 0 96 154
who 0 96 154
expressed 0 96 154
his 0 96 154
surprise 0 96 154
to 0 96 154
me, 0 96 154
telling 0 96 154
me 0 96 154
that 0 96 154
he 0 96 154
knew 0 96 154
nothing 0 96 154
about 0 96 154
that 0 96 154
announcement 0 96 154
and 0 96 154
that 0 96 154
he 0 96 154
would 0 96 154
cancel 0 96 154
it. 0 96 154

If, 1 96 155
as 1 96 155
he 1 96 155
now 1 96 155
continues 1 96 155
to 1 96 155
state, 1 96 155
he 1 96 155
knew 1 96 155
nothing 1 96 155
of 1 96 155
the 1 96 155
abuses 1 96 155
committed 1 96 155
by 1 96 155
McCarrick 1 96 155
and 1 96 155
the 1 96 155
measures 1 96 155
taken 1 96 155
by 1 96 155
Pope 1 96 155
Benedict, 1 96 155
how 1 96 155
can 1 96 155
his 1 96 155
answer 1 96 155
be 1 96 155
explained? 1 96 155

His 0 96 156
recent 0 96 156
statements 0 96 156
that 0 96 156
he 0 96 156
knew 0 96 156
nothing 0 96 156
about 0 96 156
it, 0 96 156
even 0 96 156
though 0 96 156
at 0 96 156
first 0 96 156
he 0 96 156
cunningly 0 96 156
referred 0 96 156
to 0 96 156
compensation 0 96 156
for 0 96 156
the 0 96 156
two 0 96 156
victims, 0 96 156
are 0 96 156
absolutely 1 96 156
laughable. 1 96 156

The 0 96 157
Cardinal 0 96 157
lies 1 96 157
shamelessly 1 96 157
and 0 96 157
prevails 0 96 157
upon 0 96 157
his 0 96 157
Chancellor, 0 96 157
Monsignor 0 96 157
Antonicelli, 0 96 157
to 0 96 157
lie 0 96 157
as 0 96 157
well. 0 96 157

Cardinal 0 96 158
Wuerl 0 96 158
also 0 96 158
clearly 0 96 158
lied 0 96 158
on 0 96 158
another 0 96 158
occasion. 0 96 158

Following 0 96 159
a 0 96 159
morally 0 96 159
unacceptable 0 96 159
event 0 96 159
authorized 0 96 159
by 0 96 159
the 0 96 159
academic 0 96 159
authorities 0 96 159
of 0 96 159
Georgetown 0 96 159
University, 0 96 159
I 0 96 159
brought 0 96 159
it 0 96 159
to 0 96 159
the 0 96 159
attention 0 96 159
of 0 96 159
its 0 96 159
President, 0 96 159
Dr. 0 96 159
John 0 96 159
DeGioia, 0 96 159
sending 0 96 159
him 0 96 159
two 0 96 159
subsequent 0 96 159
letters. 0 96 159

Before 0 96 160
forwarding 0 96 160
them 0 96 160
to 0 96 160
the 0 96 160
addressee, 0 96 160
so 0 96 160
as 0 96 160
to 0 96 160
handle 0 96 160
things 0 96 160
properly, 0 96 160
I 0 96 160
personally 0 96 160
gave 0 96 160
a 0 96 160
copy 0 96 160
of 0 96 160
them 0 96 160
to 0 96 160
the 0 96 160
Cardinal 0 96 160
with 0 96 160
an 0 96 160
accompanying 0 96 160
letter 0 96 160
I 0 96 160
had 0 96 160
written. 0 96 160

The 0 96 161
Cardinal 0 96 161
told 0 96 161
me 0 96 161
that 0 96 161
he 0 96 161
knew 0 96 161
nothing 0 96 161
about 0 96 161
it. 0 96 161

However, 1 96 162
he 1 96 162
failed 1 96 162
to 1 96 162
acknowledge 1 96 162
receipt 1 96 162
of 1 96 162
my 1 96 162
two 1 96 162
letters, 1 96 162
contrary 1 96 162
to 1 96 162
what 1 96 162
he 1 96 162
customarily 1 96 162
did. 1 96 162

I 0 96 163
subsequently 0 96 163
learned 0 96 163
that 0 96 163
the 0 96 163
event 0 96 163
at 0 96 163
Georgetown 0 96 163
had 0 96 163
taken 0 96 163
place 0 96 163
for 0 96 163
seven 0 96 163
years. 0 96 163

But 0 96 164
the 0 96 164
Cardinal 0 96 164
knew 0 96 164
nothing 0 96 164
about 0 96 164
it! 0 96 164

Cardinal 0 96 165
Wuerl, 0 96 165
well 0 96 165
aware 0 96 165
of 0 96 165
the 0 96 165
continuous 0 96 165
abuses 0 96 165
committed 0 96 165
by 0 96 165
Cardinal 0 96 165
McCarrick 0 96 165
and 0 96 165
the 0 96 165
sanctions 0 96 165
imposed 0 96 165
on 0 96 165
him 0 96 165
by 0 96 165
Pope 0 96 165
Benedict, 0 96 165
transgressing 0 96 165
the 0 96 165
Pope’s 0 96 165
order, 0 96 165
also 0 96 165
allowed 0 96 165
him 0 96 165
to 0 96 165
reside 0 96 165
at 0 96 165
a 0 96 165
seminary 0 96 165
in 0 96 165
Washington 0 96 165
D.C. 0 96 165

In 0 96 166
doing 0 96 166
so, 0 96 166
he 1 96 166

What 0 96 168
really 0 96 168
concerns 0 96 168
Faggioli 0 96 168
and 0 96 168
those 0 96 168
who 0 96 168
think 0 96 168
like 0 96 168
him 0 96 168
is 0 96 168
not 0 96 168
Wuerl 0 96 168
and 0 96 168
his 0 96 168
“complex 0 96 168
situation,” 0 96 168
which 0 96 168
is 0 96 168
not 0 96 168
complex 0 96 168
at 0 96 168
all. 0 96 168

Rather, 0 96 169
what 0 96 169
he 0 96 169
views 0 96 169
with 0 96 169
alarm 0 96 169
as 0 96 169
an 0 96 169
“essential 0 96 169
element” 0 96 169
of 0 96 169
the 0 96 169
context 0 96 169
in 0 96 169
which 0 96 169
Wuerl 0 96 169
operates 0 96 169
is 0 96 169
that 0 96 169
“scandals 0 96 169
are 0 96 169
also 0 96 169
the 0 96 169
opportunity 0 96 169
for 0 96 169
the 0 96 169
neo-traditionalist 0 96 169
Catholicism 0 96 169
of 0 96 169
the 0 96 169
younger 0 96 169
generations 0 96 169
of 0 96 169
American 0 96 169
Catholics 0 96 169
to 0 96 169
attack 0 96 169
American 0 96 169
bishops 0 96 169
and 0 96 169
cardinals 0 96 169
close 0 96 169
to 0 96 169
Pope 0 96 169
Francis….” 0 96 169
Better 1 96 169
a 1 96 169
thousand 1 96 169
septuagenarian 1 96 169
Wuerls 1 96 169
in 1 96 169
their 1 96 169
lavish 1 96 169
sties 1 96 169
of 1 96 169
corruption, 1 96 169
financed 1 96 169
by 1 96 169
the 1 96 169
faithful, 1 96 169
than 1 96 169
a 1 96 169
single, 1 96 169
young 1 96 169
neo-traditionalist 1 96 169
prelate! 1 96 169

But 0 96 170
what 0 96 170
exactly 0 96 170
is 0 96 170
a 0 96 170
neo-traditionalist? 0 96 170

Quite 0 96 171
simply: 0 96 171
an 1 96 171
orthodox 1 96 171
Catholic 1 96 171
who 1 96 171
has 1 96 171
had 1 96 171
enough 1 96 171
of 1 96 171
the 1 96 171
homosexual-infested 1 96 171
regime 1 96 171
of 1 96 171
novelty 1 96 171
imposed 1 96 171
on 1 96 171
the 1 96 171
Church 1 96 171
by 1 96 171
the 1 96 171
old 1 96 171
men 1 96 171
of 1 96 171
the 1 96 171
Council, 1 96 171
Bergoglio 0 96 171
merely 0 96 171
being 0 96 171
the 0 96 171
latest, 0 96 171
the 0 96 171
highest 0 96 171
placed, 0 96 171
and 0 96 171
one 0 96 171
of 0 96 171
the 0 96 171
last. 0 96 171

As 1 96 172
Faggioli 1 96 172
puts 1 96 172
it: 1 96 172
“In 1 96 172
the 1 96 172
last 1 96 172
fifteen 1 96 172
years, 1 96 172
the 1 96 172
American 1 96 172
Catholic 1 96 172
Church 1 96 172
has 1 96 172
been 1 96 172
traversed 1 96 172
by 1 96 172
a 1 96 172
radicalization 1 96 172
of 1 96 172
religious 1 96 172
conservatism 1 96 172
in 1 96 172
the 1 96 172
neo-traditionalism 1 96 172
sense, 1 96 172
especially 1 96 172
in 1 96 172
the 1 96 172
younger 1 96 172
generations 1 96 172
of 1 96 172
priests 1 96 172
and 1 96 172
intellectuals. 1 96 172

They 1 96 173
interpret 1 96 173
the 1 96 173
current 1 96 173
abuse 1 96 173
crisis 1 96 173
as 1 96 173
fruit 1 96 173
of 1 96 173
the 1 96 173
mistakes 1 96 173
of 1 96 173
the 1 96 173
Council 1 96 173
itself 1 96 173
and 1 96 173
not 1 96 173
only 1 96 173
of 1 96 173
the 1 96 173
post-Council…” 1 96 173

Just 0 96 174
as 0 96 174
Faggioli 0 96 174
fears, 0 96 174
many 0 96 174
in 0 96 174
the 0 96 174
up-and-coming 0 96 174
generation 0 96 174
of 0 96 174
Catholic 0 96 174
clergy 0 96 174
and 0 96 174
laity 0 96 174
recognize 0 96 174
the 0 96 174
obvious: 0 96 174
that 0 96 174
the 0 96 174
conciliar 0 96 174
texts, 0 96 174
for 0 96 174
all 0 96 174
their 0 96 174
prolix 0 96 174
repetition 0 96 174
of 0 96 174
traditional 0 96 174
teaching, 0 96 174
opened 1 96 174
the 1 96 174
way 1 96 174
to 1 96 174
ecclesial 1 96 174
disaster. 1 96 174

Because 0 96 175
in 0 96 175
those 0 96 175
texts—above 0 96 175
all 0 96 175
Gaudium 0 96 175

Nostra 0 96 175
Aetate 0 96 175
and 0 96 175
Sacrosanctum 0 96 175
Concilium—the 0 96 175
Council 0 96 175
verbally 0 96 175
prostrated 0 96 175
itself 0 96 175
before 0 96 175
“the 0 96 175
modern 0 96 175
world” 0 96 175
and 0 96 175
the 0 96 175
practitioners 0 96 175
of 0 96 175
other 0 96 175
religions 0 96 175
while 0 96 175
authorizing 0 96 175
Bugnini 0 96 175
(Secretary 0 96 175
of 0 96 175
the 0 96 175
liturgical 0 96 175
Preparatory 0 96 175
Commission 0 96 175
that 0 96 175
drafted 0 96 175
what 0 96 175
would 0 96 175
become 0 96 175
Sacrosanctum 0 96 175
Concilium) 0 96 175
to 0 96 175
begin 0 96 175
demolition 1 96 175
of 1 96 175
the 1 96 175
sacred 1 96 175
liturgy 1 96 175
that 0 96 175
was 0 96 175
the 0 96 175
very 0 96 175
foundation 0 96 175
Catholic 0 96 175
of 0 96 175
orthodoxy 0 96 175
and 0 96 175
orthopraxis. 0 96 175

To 0 96 176
quote 0 96 176
Paul 0 96 176
VI, 0 96 176
then 0 96 176
in 1 96 176
the 1 96 176
depths 1 96 176
of 1 96 176
his 1 96 176
conciliar 1 96 176
delirium 1 96 176
at 0 96 176
the 0 96 176
Council’s 0 96 176
close: 0 96 176

But 0 96 177
one 0 96 177
must 0 96 177
realize 0 96 177
that 0 96 177
this 0 96 177
council, 0 96 177
which 0 96 177
exposed 0 96 177
itself 0 96 177
to 0 96 177
human 0 96 177
judgment, 0 96 177
insisted 0 96 177
very 0 96 177
much 0 96 177
more 0 96 177
upon 0 96 177
this 0 96 177
pleasant 0 96 177
side 0 96 177
of 0 96 177
man, 0 96 177
rather 0 96 177
than 0 96 177
on 0 96 177
his 0 96 177
unpleasant 0 96 177
one. 0 96 177

Its 0 96 178
attitude 0 96 178
was 0 96 178
very 0 96 178
much 0 96 178
and 0 96 178
deliberately 0 96 178
optimistic. 0 96 178

A 0 96 179
wave 1 96 179
of 1 96 179
affection 1 96 179
and 1 96 179
admiration 1 96 179
flowed 1 96 179
from 1 96 179
the 1 96 179
council 1 96 179
over 1 96 179
the 1 96 179
modern 1 96 179
world 1 96 179
of 1 96 179
humanity…. 1 96 179

Instead 0 96 180
of 0 96 180
depressing 0 96 180
diagnoses, 0 96 180
encouraging 0 96 180
remedies; 0 96 180
instead 0 96 180
of 0 96 180
direful 0 96 180
prognostics, 0 96 180
messages 0 96 180
of 0 96 180
trust 0 96 180
issued 0 96 180
from 0 96 180
the 0 96 180
council 0 96 180
to 0 96 180
the 0 96 180
present-day 0 96 180
world. 0 96 180

The 0 96 181
modern 0 96 181
world’s 0 96 181
values 0 96 181
were 0 96 181
not 0 96 181
only 0 96 181
respected 0 96 181
but 0 96 181
honored, 0 96 181
its 0 96 181
efforts 0 96 181
approved, 0 96 181
its 1 96 181
aspirations 1 96 181
purified 1 96 181
and 1 96 181
blessed. 1 96 181

[emphasis 0 96 182
added] 0 96 182

Thus 1 96 183
did 1 96 183
Paul 1 96 183
describe 1 96 183
the 1 96 183
conciliar 1 96 183
“opening 1 96 183
to 1 96 183
the 1 96 183
world” 1 96 183
through 1 96 183
which 1 96 183
the 1 96 183
world 1 96 183
promptly 1 96 183
invaded 1 96 183
the 1 96 183
Church, 1 96 183
including 1 96 183
large 1 96 183
numbers 1 96 183
of 1 96 183
homosexuals 1 96 183
who 1 96 183
should 1 96 183
never 1 96 183
have 1 96 183
been 1 96 183
admitted 1 96 183
to 1 96 183
the 1 96 183
seminary. 1 96 183

In 0 96 184
sum, 0 96 184
Faggioli 0 96 184
is 0 96 184
representative 0 96 184
of 0 96 184
the 0 96 184
thinking 0 96 184
that 0 96 184
requires 0 96 184
defense 0 96 184
of 0 96 184
a 0 96 184
homosexualized 0 96 184
clergy 0 96 184
if 0 96 184
only 0 96 184
for 0 96 184
the 0 96 184
reason 0 96 184
that 0 96 184
tradition-minded 0 96 184
Catholics 0 96 184
cannot 0 96 184
be 0 96 184
allowed 0 96 184
to 0 96 184
take 0 96 184
their 0 96 184
place: 0 96 184
“This 0 96 184
neo-traditionalist 0 96 184
Catholicism 0 96 184
believes 0 96 184
that 0 96 184
sexual 0 96 184
abuses 0 96 184
are 0 96 184
committed 0 96 184
only 0 96 184
by 0 96 184
homosexual 0 96 184
clergy… 0 96 184
and 0 96 184
that 0 96 184
the 0 96 184
crisis 0 96 184
of 0 96 184
abuse 0 96 184
can 0 96 184
be 0 96 184
resolved 0 96 184
by 0 96 184
a 0 96 184
kind 0 96 184
of 0 96 184
Catholic 0 96 184
Jacobinism 0 96 184
that 0 96 184
should 0 96 184
eliminate 0 96 184
all 0 96 184
bishops 0 96 184
and 0 96 184
priests 0 96 184
minimally 0 96 184
engaged 0 96 184
in 0 96 184
dialogue 0 96 184
with 0 96 184
modern 0 96 184
culture, 0 96 184
and 0 96 184
replaced 0 96 184
by 0 96 184
a 1 96 184
young 1 96 184
clergy 1 96 184
marked 1 96 184
by 1 96 184
personal 1 96 184
sanctity 1 96 184
but 1 96 184
also 1 96 184
by 1 96 184
a 1 96 184
fascination 1 96 184
for 1 96 184
a 1 96 184
mythical 1 96 184
Middle 1 96 184
Ages 1 96 184
and 0 96 184
the 0 96 184
rejection 0 96 184
of 0 96 184
a 0 96 184
Church-world 0 96 184
relationship 0 96 184
based 0 96 184
on 0 96 184
a 0 96 184
principle 0 96 184
of 0 96 184
reality.” 0 96 184

Rather 0 96 185
than 0 96 185
“young 1 96 185
clergy 1 96 185
marked 1 96 185
by 1 96 185
personal 1 96 185
sanctity,” 1 96 185
the 0 96 185
neo-Catholic 0 96 185
mentality 0 96 185
Faggioli 0 96 185
exemplifies 0 96 185
prefers 0 96 185
that 0 96 185
homosexual 0 96 185
priests 0 96 185
and 0 96 185
bishops 0 96 185
be 0 96 185
kept 0 96 185
in 0 96 185
place 0 96 185
in 0 96 185
order 0 96 185
to 0 96 185
continue 0 96 185
the 0 96 185
“dialogue 0 96 185
with 0 96 185
modern 0 96 185
culture.” 0 96 185
It 0 96 185
is 0 96 185
not 0 96 185
the 0 96 185
integrity 0 96 185
of 0 96 185
the 0 96 185
Faith 0 96 185
that 0 96 185
matters 0 96 185
but 0 96 185
only 0 96 185
perpetuation 0 96 185
of 0 96 185
the 0 96 185
post-conciliar 0 96 185
regime 0 96 185
of 0 96 185
novelty. 0 96 185

Any 1 96 186
abandonment 1 96 186
of 1 96 186
the 1 96 186
regime 1 96 186
must 1 96 186
be 1 96 186
viewed 1 96 186
as 1 96 186
ecclesiastical 1 96 186
treason—“Catholic 1 96 186
Jacobinism”—if 1 96 186
not 1 96 186
criminal 1 96 186
activity. 1 96 186

Faggioli 0 96 187
would 0 96 187
probably 0 96 187
be 0 96 187
more 0 96 187
inclined 0 96 187
to 0 96 187
civil 0 96 187
or 0 96 187
criminal 0 96 187
prosecution 0 96 187
of 0 96 187
“Catholic 0 96 187
Jacobins” 0 96 187

than 0 96 187
Novus 0 96 187

in 0 96 187
covering 0 96 187
up 0 96 187
homosexual 0 96 187

“Homosexuality 1 96 188
in 1 96 188
the 1 96 188
clergy 1 96 188
exists 1 96 188
and 1 96 188
is 1 96 188
a 1 96 188
matter 1 96 188
that 1 96 188
must 1 96 188
be 1 96 188
addressed,” 1 96 188
Faggioli 0 96 188
fleetingly 0 96 188
acknowledges 0 96 188
toward 0 96 188
the 0 96 188
end 0 96 188
of 0 96 188
his 0 96 188
piece, 0 96 188
“but 0 96 188
the 0 96 188
abuse 0 96 188
crisis 0 96 188
cannot 0 96 188
be 0 96 188
resolved 0 96 188
by 0 96 188
making 0 96 188
homosexuals 0 96 188
within 0 96 188
the 0 96 188
Church 0 96 188
the 0 96 188
scapegoat 0 96 188
of 0 96 188
a 0 96 188
scandal 0 96 188
that 0 96 188
has 0 96 188
ancient 0 96 188
roots, 0 96 188
well 0 96 188
before 0 96 188
Vatican 0 96 188
Council 0 96 188
II.” 0 96 188
And 1 96 188
how 1 96 188
does 1 96 188
the 1 96 188
Church 1 96 188
“address” 1 96 188
a 1 96 188
massive 1 96 188
infestation 1 96 188
by 1 96 188
homosexual 1 96 188
priests 1 96 188
and 1 96 188
prelates 1 96 188
without 1 96 188
removing 1 96 188
them 1 96 188
from 1 96 188
authority 1 96 188
and 1 96 188
ensuring 1 96 188
that 1 96 188
they 1 96 188
cannot 1 96 188
promote 1 96 188
homosexual 1 96 188
successors 1 96 188
for 1 96 188
generation 1 96 188
after 1 96 188
generation? 1 96 188

Faggioli 0 96 189
has 0 96 189
no 0 96 189
answer 0 96 189
because 0 96 189
what 1 96 189
he 1 96 189
is 1 96 189
really 1 96 189
arguing—the 1 96 189
final 1 96 189
beachhead 1 96 189
of 1 96 189
the 1 96 189
neo-Catholic 1 96 189
defense 1 96 189
of 1 96 189
their 1 96 189
disintegrating 1 96 189
regime—is 1 96 189
that 1 96 189
homosexuals 1 96 189
in 1 96 189
the 1 96 189
hierarchy 1 96 189
must 1 96 189
remain 1 96 189
in 1 96 189
authority 1 96 189
as 1 96 189
an 1 96 189
indispensable 1 96 189
seawall 1 96 189
against 1 96 189
a 1 96 189
“neo-traditionalist” 1 96 189
storm 1 96 189
surge. 1 96 189

Faggioli’s 1 96 190
argument 1 96 190
demonstrates 1 96 190
that 1 96 190
neo-Catholicism 1 96 190
has 1 96 190
never 1 96 190
been 1 96 190
about 1 96 190
making 1 96 190
the 1 96 190
authentic 1 96 190
Faith 1 96 190
more 1 96 190
appealing 1 96 190
to 1 96 190
a 1 96 190
“modern 1 96 190
world” 1 96 190
founded 1 96 190
precisely 1 96 190
on 1 96 190
a 1 96 190
rejection 1 96 190
of 1 96 190
the 1 96 190
Church’s 1 96 190
authority. 1 96 190

It 1 96 191
is 1 96 191
not 1 96 191
about 1 96 191
the 1 96 191
Faith 1 96 191
at 1 96 191
all. 1 96 191

Rather, 1 96 192
it 1 96 192
is 1 96 192
an 1 96 192
ideological 1 96 192
movement 1 96 192
dedicated 1 96 192
to 1 96 192
the 1 96 192
face-saving 1 96 192
defense 1 96 192
of 1 96 192
a 1 96 192
catastrophic 1 96 192
failure 1 96 192
in 1 96 192
ecclesial 1 96 192
innovation 1 96 192
that 1 96 192
has 1 96 192
corrupted 1 96 192
the 1 96 192
human 1 96 192
element 1 96 192
of 1 96 192
the 1 96 192
Church 1 96 192
in 1 96 192
practically 1 96 192
every 1 96 192
department. 1 96 192

For 0 96 193
people 0 96 193
like 0 96 193
Faggioli, 0 96 193
indeed 0 96 193
for 0 96 193
the 1 96 193
tradition-hating 1 96 193
Pope 1 96 193
they 0 96 193
blindly 0 96 193
defend, 0 96 193
the 0 96 193
one 0 96 193
thing 0 96 193
to 0 96 193
be 0 96 193
feared 0 96 193
is 0 96 193
that 0 96 193
more 1 96 193
and 1 96 193
more 1 96 193
faithful 1 96 193
will 1 96 193
recognize 1 96 193
the 1 96 193
neo-Catholic 1 96 193
polemic 1 96 193
for 1 96 193
what 1 96 193
it 1 96 193
is—a 1 96 193
fraud—and 1 96 193
begin 1 96 193
demanding 1 96 193
a 1 96 193
return 1 96 193
of 1 96 193
everything 1 96 193
the 1 96 193
regime 1 96 193
of 1 96 193
novelty 1 96 193
has 1 96 193
stolen 1 96 193
from 1 96 193
the 1 96 193
life 1 96 193
of 1 96 193
the 1 96 193
Church. 1 96 193

That 1 96 194
is 1 96 194
exactly 1 96 194
what 1 96 194
a 1 96 194
growing 1 96 194
number 1 96 194
of 1 96 194
Catholics 1 96 194
are 1 96 194
now 1 96 194
doing, 1 96 194
as 1 96 194
even 1 96 194
the 1 96 194
secular 1 96 194
press 1 96 194
recognized 1 96 194
less 1 96 194
than 1 96 194
three 1 96 194
months 1 96 194
before 1 96 194
Bergoglio 1 96 194
began 1 96 194
his 1 96 194
tyrannical 1 96 194
reign. 1 96 194

In 0 96 195
this 0 96 195
respect, 0 96 195
what 0 96 195
the 0 96 195
neo-Catholics 0 96 195
are 0 96 195
defending 0 96 195
at 0 96 195
bottom 0 96 195
is 0 96 195
themselves—that 0 96 195
is, 0 96 195
the 0 96 195
reputations 0 96 195
they 0 96 195
have 0 96 195
all 0 96 195
staked 0 96 195
on 0 96 195
their 0 96 195
defense 0 96 195
of 0 96 195
the 0 96 195
indefensible 0 96 195
against 0 96 195
the 0 96 195
traditionalists 0 96 195
they 0 96 195
have 0 96 195
arrogantly 0 96 195
mocked 0 96 195
and 0 96 195
marginalized 0 96 195
for 0 96 195
decades 0 96 195
only 0 96 195
to 0 96 195
see, 0 96 195
to 1 96 195
their 1 96 195
horror, 1 96 195
that 0 96 195
traditionalism 0 96 195
is 0 96 195
ever 0 96 195
more 0 96 195
vindicated 0 96 195
as 0 96 195
the 0 96 195
scandals 0 96 195
of 0 96 195
the 0 96 195
Novus 0 96 195
Ordo 0 96 195
mount 1 96 195
under 1 96 195
this 1 96 195
reckless 1 96 195
Pope 1 96 195
to 1 96 195
an 1 96 195
unsustainable, 1 96 195
indeed 1 96 195
apocalyptic, 1 96 195
level. 1 96 195

A 0 96 196
return 0 96 196
to 0 96 196
integral 0 96 196
Tradition 0 96 196
is 0 96 196
the 0 96 196
threat 0 96 196
that 0 96 196
Faggioli 0 96 196
sees 0 96 196
as 0 96 196
coming 0 96 196
particularly 0 96 196
from 0 96 196
the 0 96 196
young. 0 96 196

Irony 1 96 197
of 1 96 197
ironies, 1 96 197
he 0 96 197
is 0 96 197
now 0 96 197
reduced 0 96 197
to 0 96 197
defending 0 96 197
what 0 96 197
is 0 96 197
old 0 96 197
and 0 96 197
tired 0 96 197
and 0 96 197
corrupt 0 96 197
against 0 96 197
a 0 96 197
restoration, 0 96 197
led 0 96 197
largely 0 96 197
by 0 96 197
a 1 96 197
youthful 1 96 197
vanguard, 1 96 197
of 1 96 197
what 1 96 197
is 1 96 197
ever 1 96 197
ancient 1 96 197
but 1 96 197
ever 1 96 197
new. 1 96 197

For 0 96 198
some, 0 96 198
it 0 96 198
seems, 0 96 198
no 0 96 198
price 0 96 198
is 0 96 198
too 0 96 198
great—not 0 96 198
even 0 96 198
the 0 96 198
good 0 96 198
of 0 96 198
the 0 96 198
Church—to 0 96 198
avoid 0 96 198
the 0 96 198
personal 0 96 198
ignominy 0 96 198
of 0 96 198
being 0 96 198
seen 0 96 198
on 0 96 198
the 0 96 198
wrong 0 96 198
side 0 96 198
of 0 96 198
history. 0 96 198

Conclusion: 0 96 199
The 0 96 199
Fatima 0 96 199
Connection 0 96 199

Long 0 96 200
before 0 96 200
the 0 96 200
arrival 0 96 200
of 0 96 200
Bergoglio 0 96 200
in 0 96 200
Rome, 0 96 200
the 0 96 200
successive 0 96 200
Vatican 0 96 200
Secretaries 0 96 200
of 0 96 200
State, 0 96 200
Angelo 0 96 200
Sodano 0 96 200
and 0 96 200
Tarcisio 0 96 200
Bertone, 0 96 200
were 0 96 200
instrumental 0 96 200
in 0 96 200
advancing 0 96 200
the 0 96 200
homosexual 0 96 200
corruption 0 96 200
of 0 96 200
the 0 96 200

establishment. 0 96 200

As 0 96 201
to 0 96 201
Bertone 0 96 201
and 0 96 201
Sodano, 0 96 201
Viganò 0 96 201

further 0 96 201
vital 0 96 201
testimony: 0 96 201

sexual 0 96 202
abuse], 0 96 202
with 0 96 202
all 0 96 202
the 0 96 202
attachments, 0 96 202
was 0 96 202

as 0 96 202
Secretary 0 96 202
of 0 96 202

My 0 96 203
two 0 96 203
above-mentioned 0 96 203

were 0 96 203
also 0 96 203
presumably 0 96 203
handed 0 96 203
over 0 96 203
to 0 96 203
him 0 96 203
by 0 96 203
the 0 96 203
Substitute. 0 96 203

As 0 96 204
already 0 96 204
mentioned, 0 96 204
the 0 96 204
Cardinal 0 96 204

no 0 96 204

I 0 96 204
cite 0 96 204

Cardinal 0 96 205
Angelo 0 96 205

McCarrick] 0 96 205

In 0 96 206
November 0 96 206
2000, 0 96 206
Nunzio 0 96 206
Montalvo 0 96 206

abuses 0 96 206
committed 0 96 206
by 0 96 206
McCarrick. 0 96 206

It 0 96 207
is 0 96 207
known 0 96 207
that 0 96 207
Sodano 0 96 207

He 0 96 208
even 0 96 208
removed 0 96 208
the 0 96 208
Nuncio 0 96 208

had 0 96 209
decided 0 96 209
that 0 96 209
the 0 96 209
Maciel 0 96 209
case 0 96 209
should 0 96 209
be 0 96 209
considered 0 96 209
closed. 0 96 209

Benedict 0 96 210
reacted, 0 96 210
despite 0 96 210
Sodano’s 0 96 210
strenuous 0 96 210
defense, 0 96 210
and 0 96 210
Maciel 0 96 210
was 0 96 210
found 0 96 210
guilty 0 96 210
and 0 96 210
irrevocably 1 96 210
condemned. 1 96 210

It 0 96 211
is 0 96 211
no 0 96 211
coincidence 0 96 211
that, 0 96 211
as 0 96 211
I 0 96 211
detail 0 96 211
in 0 96 211

of 0 96 211
Fatima, 0 96 211
Sodano 0 96 211
and 0 96 211
Bertone 0 96 211
have 0 96 211
also 0 96 211
taken 0 96 211
the 0 96 211
leading 0 96 211
role 0 96 211
in 0 96 211
suppressing 0 96 211
the 0 96 211
integral 0 96 211
Secret 0 96 211
and 0 96 211
reducing 0 96 211
the 0 96 211
Message 0 96 211
of 0 96 211
Fatima 0 96 211
in 0 96 211
general 0 96 211
to 0 96 211
a 0 96 211
generic 0 96 211
prescription 0 96 211
for 0 96 211
personal 0 96 211
piety, 0 96 211
stripped 1 96 211
of 1 96 211
its 1 96 211
prophetic 1 96 211
and 1 96 211
admonitory 1 96 211
content 1 96 211
regarding 1 96 211
the 1 96 211
epochal 1 96 211
malfeasance 1 96 211
and 1 96 211
corruption 1 96 211
of 1 96 211
the 1 96 211
upper 1 96 211

in 0 96 212
Inside 0 96 212
the 0 96 212
Vatican: 0 96 212

We 0 96 213
were 0 96 213
discussing 0 96 213
the 0 96 213
Third 0 96 213
Secret 0 96 213
of 0 96 213
Fatima, 0 96 213
the 0 96 213
allegations 0 96 213
that 0 96 213
the 0 96 213
Vatican 0 96 213
has 0 96 213
not 0 96 213
published 0 96 213
the 0 96 213

of 0 96 213
the 0 96 213
Third 0 96 213

as 0 96 213
revealed 0 96 213
to 0 96 213
Sister 0 96 213
Lucia, 0 96 213
and 0 96 213
the 0 96 213
response 0 96 213
of 0 96 213
Cardinal 0 96 213
Tarcisio 0 96 213
Bertone, 0 96 213
the 0 96 213
Vatican 0 96 213
secretary 0 96 213
of 0 96 213
state, 0 96 213
in 0 96 213
a 0 96 213
book 0 96 213
where 0 96 213
Bertone 0 96 213
states 0 96 213
that 0 96 213
there 0 96 213
is 0 96 213
nothing 0 96 213
more 0 96 213
to 0 96 213
be 0 96 213
revealed. 0 96 213

Sambi 0 96 214
said, 0 96 214
“Excuse 0 96 214
me.” 0 96 214
He 0 96 214
got 0 96 214
up, 0 96 214
went 0 96 214
out 0 96 214
of 0 96 214
the 0 96 214
room, 0 96 214
and 0 96 214
came 0 96 214
back 0 96 214
with 0 96 214
a 0 96 214
book. 0 96 214

“Here,” 0 96 215
he 0 96 215
said. 0 96 215

“Do 0 96 216
you 0 96 216
know 0 96 216
this 0 96 216
book? 0 96 216

You 0 96 217
should 0 96 217
read 0 96 217
it.” 0 96 217
It 0 96 217
was 0 96 217
Christopher 0 96 217
Ferrara's 0 96 217
The 0 96 217
Secret 0 96 217
Still 0 96 217
Hidden. 0 96 217

“Wait,” 0 96 218
I 0 96 218
said. 0 96 218

“You 1 96 219
are 1 96 219
the 1 96 219
Pope’s 1 96 219
representative 1 96 219
in 1 96 219
the 1 96 219
US, 1 96 219
and 1 96 219
you 1 96 219
are 1 96 219
urging 1 96 219
me 1 96 219
to 1 96 219
read 1 96 219
a 1 96 219
book 1 96 219
that 1 96 219
questions 1 96 219
what 1 96 219
the 1 96 219
secretary 1 96 219
of 1 96 219
state 1 96 219
wrote?” 1 96 219
Sambi 0 96 219
replied, 0 96 219
“All 0 96 219
I 0 96 219
am 0 96 219
saying 0 96 219
is 0 96 219
that 0 96 219
there 0 96 219
are 0 96 219
interesting 0 96 219
things 0 96 219
worth 0 96 219
reading 0 96 219
in 0 96 219
this 0 96 219
book. 0 96 219

And 0 96 220
in 0 96 220
the 0 96 220
end, 0 96 220
we 0 96 220
are 0 96 220
all 0 96 220
after 0 96 220
the 0 96 220
truth, 0 96 220
aren’t 0 96 220
we? 0 96 220

The 0 96 221
truth 0 96 221
is 0 96 221
the 0 96 221
important 0 96 221
thing...” 0 96 221

The 0 96 222
truth 0 96 222
is 0 96 222
indeed 0 96 222
the 0 96 222
important 0 96 222
thing. 0 96 222

And 0 96 223
the 0 96 223
truth 0 96 223
about 0 96 223
our 0 96 223
situation 0 96 223
is 0 96 223
revealed 0 96 223
in 0 96 223
that 0 96 223
still-hidden 0 96 223
part 0 96 223
of 0 96 223
the 0 96 223
Secret 0 96 223
to 0 96 223
whose 0 96 223
contents 0 96 223
Pope 0 96 223
Benedict 0 96 223
alluded 0 96 223
during 0 96 223
his 0 96 223
pilgrimage 0 96 223
to 0 96 223
Fatima 0 96 223
in 0 96 223
2010, 0 96 223
identifying 0 96 223
elements 0 96 223
that 0 96 223
do 0 96 223
not 0 96 223
appear 0 96 223
at 0 96 223
all 0 96 223
in 0 96 223
the 0 96 223
obscure 0 96 223
vision 0 96 223
published 0 96 223
back 0 96 223
in 0 96 223
2000, 0 96 223
which 0 96 223
Sodano 0 96 223
and 0 96 223
Bertone 0 96 223
tried 0 96 223
to 0 96 223
pass 0 96 223
of 0 96 223
as 0 96 223
the 0 96 223
entirety 0 96 223
of 0 96 223
the 0 96 223
Secret 0 96 223
at 0 96 223
the 0 96 223
same 0 96 223
time 0 96 223
they 0 96 223
were 0 96 223
covering 0 96 223
up 0 96 223
homosexual 0 96 223
corruption 0 96 223
in 0 96 223
high 0 96 223
places: 0 96 223

As 0 96 224
for 0 96 224
the 0 96 224
new 0 96 224
things 0 96 224
which 0 96 224
we 0 96 224
can 0 96 224
find 0 96 224
in 0 96 224
this 0 96 224
message 0 96 224
today, 0 96 224
there 0 96 224
is 0 96 224
also 0 96 224
the 0 96 224
fact 0 96 224
that 0 96 224
attacks 0 96 224
on 0 96 224
the 0 96 224
Pope 0 96 224
and 0 96 224
the 0 96 224
Church 0 96 224
come 0 96 224
not 0 96 224
only 0 96 224
from 0 96 224
without, 0 96 224
but 0 96 224
the 1 96 224
sufferings 1 96 224
of 1 96 224
the 1 96 224
Church 1 96 224
come 0 96 224
precisely 0 96 224
from 0 96 224
within 0 96 224
the 0 96 224
Church, 0 96 224
from 0 96 224
the 0 96 224
sin 0 96 224
existing 0 96 224
within 0 96 224
the 0 96 224
Church. 0 96 224

This 0 96 225
too 0 96 225
is 0 96 225
something 0 96 225
that 0 96 225
we 0 96 225
have 0 96 225
always 0 96 225
known, 0 96 225
but 0 96 225
today 0 96 225
we 0 96 225
are 0 96 225
seeing 0 96 225
it 0 96 225
in 0 96 225
a 1 96 225
really 1 96 225
terrifying 1 96 225
way: 1 96 225
that 0 96 225
the 0 96 225
greatest 0 96 225
persecution 0 96 225
of 0 96 225
the 0 96 225
Church 0 96 225
comes 0 96 225
not 0 96 225
from 0 96 225
her 0 96 225
enemies 0 96 225
without, 0 96 225
but 0 96 225
arises 0 96 225
from 0 96 225
sin 0 96 225
within 0 96 225
the 0 96 225
Church, 0 96 225
and 0 96 225
that 0 96 225
the 0 96 225
Church 0 96 225
thus 0 96 225
has 0 96 225
a 1 96 225
deep 1 96 225
need 1 96 225
to 1 96 225
relearn 1 96 225
penance, 1 96 225
to 1 96 225
accept 1 96 225
purification, 1 96 225
to 1 96 225
learn 1 96 225
forgiveness 1 96 225
on 0 96 225
the 0 96 225
one 0 96 225
hand, 0 96 225
but 0 96 225
also 0 96 225
the 0 96 225
need 0 96 225
for 0 96 225
justice. 0 96 225

[emphasis 0 96 226
added] 0 96 226

I 1 96 227
believe 1 96 227
that 1 96 227
Archbishop 1 96 227
Viganò’s 1 96 227
precious 1 96 227
testimony 1 96 227
is 1 96 227
a 1 96 227
sign 1 96 227
that 1 96 227
Heaven 1 96 227
itself 1 96 227
is 1 96 227
now 1 96 227
responding 1 96 227
to 1 96 227
the 1 96 227
“need 1 96 227
for 1 96 227
justice” 1 96 227
in 1 96 227
the 1 96 227
Church. 1 96 227

Whether 0 96 228
or 0 96 228
not 0 96 228
justice 0 96 228
involves 0 96 228
the 0 96 228
resignation 0 96 228
of 0 96 228
the 1 96 228
most 1 96 228
wayward 1 96 228
Pope 1 96 228
in 1 96 228
Church 1 96 228
history, 1 96 228
the 0 96 228
inevitable 0 96 228
season 0 96 228
of 0 96 228
justice 0 96 228
will 0 96 228
culminate 0 96 228
in 1 96 228
the 1 96 228
triumph 1 96 228
of 1 96 228
the 1 96 228
Immaculate 1 96 228
Heart 1 96 228
of 1 96 228
Mary 1 96 228
and 0 96 228
the 0 96 228
Church’s 0 96 228
restoration. 0 96 228

This 0 96 229
will 0 96 229
be 0 96 229
a 0 96 229
final 0 96 229
victory 0 96 229
over 0 96 229
the 0 96 229
enemies 0 96 229
within 0 96 229
and 0 96 229
their 0 96 229
apologists, 0 96 229
such 0 96 229
as 0 96 229
Faggioli, 0 96 229
who, 0 96 229
in 0 96 229
typical 0 96 229
neo-Catholic 0 96 229
style, 0 96 229
imperiously 1 96 229
scoffs 1 96 229
at 0 96 229
the 0 96 229
notion 0 96 229
of 0 96 229
“a 0 96 229
young 1 96 229
clergy 1 96 229
marked 1 96 229
by 1 96 229
personal 1 96 229
sanctity 1 96 229
but 1 96 229
also 1 96 229
by 1 96 229
a 1 96 229
fascination 1 96 229
for 1 96 229
a 1 96 229
mythical 1 96 229
Middle 1 96 229
Ages” 1 96 229
and 0 96 229
busies 0 96 229
himself 0 96 229
defending 0 96 229
an 1 96 229
unsalvageable 1 96 229
mass 1 96 229
of 1 96 229
corruption 1 96 229
he 0 96 229
dares 0 96 229
to 0 96 229
describe 0 96 229
as 0 96 229
“a 0 96 229
Church-world 1 96 229
relationship 1 96 229
based 1 96 229
on 1 96 229
a 1 96 229
principle 1 96 229
of 1 96 229
reality.” 1 96 229

I 0 96 230
can 0 96 230
only 0 96 230
conclude 0 96 230
by 0 96 230
making 0 96 230
my 0 96 230
own 0 96 230
these 0 96 230
closing 0 96 230
words 0 96 230
of 0 96 230
Archbishop 0 96 230
Viganò: 0 96 230
