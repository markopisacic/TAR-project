The 0

Thursday 0
that 0
“Chris 0

the 0
21st 0

the 0

be 0

one 0
of 0
that 0
once 1
great 1
nation’s 1

moments 1
and 1
a 1

was 0
the 1
victory 1
of 1

law, 1

citing 0
the 0
Geller-Spencer 0
ban 0
in 0
the 0
U.K. 0
to 0
ban 0
Trump 0
was 0
inevitable. 0

It’s 0
like 0
the 0
Geller 0
ban 0
on 0
ads 0
on 0
buses 0
and 0
subways 0
in 0
every 0
major 0
American 0

just 0
tried 0
to 0
run 0
ads 0
on 0
buses 0
in 0
Washington, 0
D.C., 0
and 0
discovered 0
that 0
it 0
couldn’t 0
because 0
of 0
the 0
ban 0
on 0
all 0
political 0
ads 0
that 0
was 0
enacted 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
prevent 0
my 0

from 0
running. 0

Once 0
you 0
sanction 0
the 0
silencing 0
and 0
persecution 0
of 0
one, 0
inevitably, 0
you’ve 0
sanctioned 0
it 0
for 0
all. 0

It’s 0
open 0
season 0

the 0
opposition. 0

Who 0
decides 0
what’s 0

what’s 0
forbidden 0
in 0
a 0

society? 0

totalitarians. 0

The 1

howl 1
at 1
Trump’s 1
retweets 1
of 1
videos 1
tweeted 1
out 1
by 1
a 1
British 1
politician 1
is 1
further 1
proof 1
of 1
the 1
Islamization 1
of 1
the 1
West. 1

It 0
speaks 0
to 0
how 0
deeply 0
and 0
far 0
and 0
widely 0
sharia 0
has 0
been 0
normed 0
and 0
accepted 0
by 0
Western 0
elites. 0

The 0
videos 0
in 0
the 0
retweets 0
are 0
authentic 0
and 0

circulated 0
for 0
years. 0

They’re 0
neither 0
“far-right” 0
nor 0
“Islamophobic”; 0
they’re 0
just 0
factual. 0

Once 1
again 1
the 1
media 1
are 1
blaming 1
the 1
messenger 1
instead 1
of 1
dealing 1
with 1
Islamic 1
violence. 1

Trump 0
didn’t 0
add 0
any 0
rhetoric 0
to 0
his 0
tweets. 0

He 0
retweeted 0
authentic 0
videos. 0

(The 0
Dutch 0
media 0
now 0
claim 0
that 0
one 0
of 0
them 0
doesn’t 0
depict 0
Muslim 0
migrants 0
being 0
violent, 0
as 0
was 0
claimed. 0

Even 0
if 0
this 0
is 0
true, 0
Muslim 0
migrant 0
violence 0
is 0
a 0
grim 1
and 1
increasingly 1
common 1
reality 1
in 0
Europe.) 0

If 1
Muslims 1
sincerely 1
condemn 1
jihad 1
terror 1
and 1
sharia 1
oppression, 1
they 1
shouldn’t 1
oppose 1
him. 1
