increasingly 0 397 7
at 0 397 7
odds 0 397 7
politically 0 397 7
and 0 397 7
economically 0 397 7
with 0 397 7
mainstream 0 397 7
European 0 397 7
Union 0 397 7
peers, 0 397 7
Orban 0 397 7
has 0 397 7
thrived 0 397 7
on 0 397 7
external 0 397 7
controversy, 0 397 7
including 0 397 7
repeated 0 397 7

lately 0 397 7
the 0 397 7
United 0 397 7

Those 0 397 8
conflicts, 0 397 8
mostly 0 397 8
centered 0 397 8
on 0 397 8
migration 0 397 8

of 1 397 8
Europe’s 1 397 8

One 0 397 9
thing 0 397 9
to 0 397 9
note 0 397 9
is 0 397 9
that 0 397 9
Christianity 1 397 9
is 1 397 9
not 1 397 9
Europe's 1 397 9
"last 1 397 9

it's 1 397 9
the 1 397 9
world's 1 397 9
"only 1 397 9
hope." 1 397 9

In 0 397 10
speaking 0 397 10
of 0 397 10
the 0 397 10
influx 0 397 10
of 0 397 10
Muslim 0 397 10
migrants 0 397 10
into 0 397 10
Europe, 0 397 10
Orban 0 397 10
sees 0 397 10
it 0 397 10
as 0 397 10
destroying 0 397 10
the 0 397 10
culture 0 397 10
of 0 397 10
Europe 0 397 10
and 0 397 10
referred 0 397 10
to 0 397 10
it 0 397 10
as 0 397 10
an 0 397 10
“immigrant 0 397 10
zone, 0 397 10
a 0 397 10
mixed 0 397 10

different 1 397 10
from 1 397 10
ours.” 1 397 10

Orban 0 397 11
then 0 397 11
called 0 397 11
out 0 397 11
the 1 397 11
traitors 1 397 11
in 0 397 11
the 0 397 11
midst 0 397 11

Europe 0 397 11
who 0 397 11

Hungary 0 397 11
to 0 397 11

“Absurd 0 397 12
as 0 397 12
it 0 397 12
may 0 397 12
sound 0 397 12
the 0 397 12
danger 0 397 12
we 0 397 12
face 0 397 12
comes 0 397 12
from 0 397 12
the 0 397 12
West, 0 397 12
from 0 397 12

“Of 0 397 13

the 0 397 15

of 0 397 15

his 0 397 15

adds: 0 397 17

Soros, 0 397 18
for 0 397 18
his 0 397 18
part, 0 397 18
compared 1 397 18
Orban 1 397 18
unfavorably 1 397 18
to 1 397 18
both 1 397 18
the 1 397 18
Nazis 1 397 18

his 0 397 18

dark 0 397 18
tones 0 397 18
from 0 397 18
the 0 397 18
1930’s 0 397 18
— 0 397 18
when 0 397 18

allied 0 397 18
with 0 397 18
Nazi 0 397 18

than 0 397 18
Cold 0 397 18

Orban 0 397 19
has 0 397 19
tightened 0 397 19
the 0 397 19
screws 0 397 19
on 0 397 19
non-government 0 397 19
organizations, 0 397 19

the 0 397 20
migration 0 397 20
crisis, 0 397 20
Orban 0 397 20
said 0 397 20
he 0 397 20
anticipated 0 397 20
that 0 397 20
powerful 0 397 20
allies 0 397 20
would 0 397 20
help 0 397 20
him 0 397 20
prevent 0 397 20
the 0 397 20
U.N. 0 397 20
from 0 397 20
greasing 0 397 20
the 0 397 20
wheels 0 397 20
of 0 397 20
migration. 0 397 20

“Soros 0 397 21
has 0 397 21
antagonized 0 397 21
not 0 397 21
only 0 397 21
us 0 397 21

also 0 397 21
England, 0 397 21
President 0 397 21

Israel 0 397 21

Orban 0 397 21
said. 0 397 21

“Everywhere 0 397 22
he 0 397 22
wants 0 397 22

accepted. 0 397 22

It 0 397 23
won’t 0 397 23
work. 0 397 23

We 0 397 24
are 0 397 24
not 0 397 24
alone 0 397 24

we 0 397 24

together 0 397 24
… 0 397 24
and 0 397 24

succeed.” 0 397 24

“We 0 397 25
don’t 0 397 25
think 0 397 25
the 0 397 25

on 0 397 25
the 0 397 25

we 0 397 25
are 0 397 25
winning,” 0 397 25
Orban 0 397 25
said. 0 397 25

“The 0 397 26
V4 0 397 26
is 0 397 26
firm, 0 397 26
Croatia 0 397 26
has 0 397 26
come 0 397 26

Austria 0 397 26

those 0 397 28
