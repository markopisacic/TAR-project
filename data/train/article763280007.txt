Geert 0 17 1
Wilders 0 17 1
spoke 0 17 1
at 0 17 1
a 0 17 1
massive 0 17 1
rally 0 17 1
for 0 17 1
Tommy 0 17 1
Robinson 0 17 1
on 0 17 1
Saturday. 0 17 1

20,000 0 17 2
people 0 17 2
came 0 17 2
out 0 17 2
to 0 17 2
call 0 17 2
for 0 17 2
Tommy’s 0 17 2
release, 0 17 2
and 0 17 2
Wilders 0 17 2
took 0 17 2
the 0 17 2
opportunity 0 17 2
to 0 17 2
put 0 17 2
the 0 17 2
political 0 17 2
elites 0 17 2
of 0 17 2
Britain 0 17 2
and 0 17 2
continental 0 17 2
Europe 0 17 2
on 0 17 2
notice. 0 17 2

“Our 1 17 3
governments,” 1 17 3
Wilders 0 17 3
declared, 0 17 3
“sold 0 17 3
us 0 17 3
out 0 17 3
with 0 17 3
mass 0 17 3
immigration. 0 17 3

With 0 17 4
Islamization. 0 17 4

With 0 17 5
open 0 17 5
borders. 0 17 5

We 0 17 6
are 0 17 6
almost 0 17 6
foreigners 0 17 6
in 0 17 6
our 0 17 6
own 0 17 6
lands. 0 17 6

And 0 17 7
if 0 17 7
we 0 17 7
complain 0 17 7
about 0 17 7
it, 0 17 7
they 0 17 7
call 0 17 7
us 0 17 7
racists 1 17 7
and 1 17 7
Islamophobes. 1 17 7

But 0 17 8
I 0 17 8
say, 0 17 8
no 1 17 8
more! 1 17 8

And 0 17 9
what 0 17 9
do 0 17 9
you 0 17 9
say? 0 17 9

No 1 17 10
more! 1 17 10

And 0 17 11
that’s 0 17 11
right: 0 17 11
enough 0 17 11
is 0 17 11
enough. 0 17 11

We 0 17 12
will 0 17 12
not 0 17 12
be 0 17 12
gagged 0 17 12
anymore. 0 17 12

No 1 17 13
more 1 17 13
tyranny.” 1 17 13

It 0 17 14
was 0 17 14
extraordinary 0 17 14
that 0 17 14
the 0 17 14
British 0 17 14
authorities 0 17 14
allowed 0 17 14
Wilders 0 17 14
into 0 17 14
the 0 17 14
country 0 17 14
at 0 17 14
all. 0 17 14

Several 0 17 15
years 0 17 15
ago 0 17 15
he 0 17 15
was 0 17 15
banned 0 17 15
from 0 17 15
entering 0 17 15
the 0 17 15
country, 0 17 15
but 0 17 15
although 0 17 15
the 0 17 15
ban 0 17 15
was 0 17 15
reversed 0 17 15
on 0 17 15
appeal, 0 17 15
the 0 17 15
British 0 17 15
government 0 17 15
recently 0 17 15
banned 0 17 15
Martin 0 17 15
Sellner, 0 17 15
Brittany 0 17 15
Pettibone, 0 17 15
Lauren 0 17 15
Southern 0 17 15
and 0 17 15
Lutz 0 17 15
Bachmann 0 17 15
from 0 17 15
entering, 0 17 15
all 0 17 15
for 0 17 15
the 0 17 15
crime 0 17 15
of 0 17 15
opposing 0 17 15
jihad 0 17 15
terror 0 17 15
and 0 17 15
Sharia 0 17 15
oppression, 0 17 15
and 0 17 15
thereby 0 17 15
made 0 17 15
it 0 17 15
clear 0 17 15
that 0 17 15
it 0 17 15
is 0 17 15
more 0 17 15
authoritarian 0 17 15
and 0 17 15
unwilling 0 17 15
to 0 17 15
uphold 0 17 15
the 0 17 15
freedom 0 17 15
of 0 17 15
speech 0 17 15
than 0 17 15
ever 0 17 15
– 0 17 15
at 0 17 15
least 0 17 15
when 0 17 15
it 0 17 15
comes 0 17 15
to 0 17 15
criticism 0 17 15
of 0 17 15
Islam, 0 17 15
Muslim 1 17 15
rape 1 17 15
gangs, 1 17 15
and 0 17 15
mass 0 17 15
Muslim 0 17 15
migration. 0 17 15

Even 0 17 16
worse, 0 17 16
the 0 17 16
bannings 0 17 16
of 0 17 16
Sellner, 0 17 16
Pettibone, 0 17 16
Southern, 0 17 16
and 0 17 16
Bachmann 0 17 16
were 0 17 16
just 0 17 16
part 0 17 16
of 0 17 16
a 0 17 16
long 0 17 16
pattern. 0 17 16

Pamela 0 17 17
Geller 0 17 17
and 0 17 17
I 0 17 17
were 0 17 17
banned 0 17 17
from 0 17 17
entering 0 17 17
Britain 0 17 17
in 0 17 17
2013, 0 17 17
apparently 0 17 17
for 0 17 17
life, 0 17 17
also 0 17 17
for 0 17 17
the 0 17 17
crime 0 17 17
of 0 17 17
telling 0 17 17
the 1 17 17
truth 1 17 17
about 1 17 17
Islam 1 17 17
and 1 17 17
jihad. 1 17 17

Meanwhile, 0 17 18
Britain 0 17 18
has 0 17 18
a 0 17 18
steadily 0 17 18
lengthening 0 17 18
record 0 17 18
of 0 17 18
admitting 0 17 18
jihad 0 17 18
preachers 0 17 18
without 1 17 18
a 1 17 18
moment 1 17 18
of 1 17 18
hesitation. 1 17 18

Syed 0 17 19
Muzaffar 0 17 19
Shah 0 17 19
Qadri’s 0 17 19
preaching 1 17 19
of 1 17 19
hatred 1 17 19
and 1 17 19
jihad 1 17 19
violence 1 17 19
was 0 17 19
so 0 17 19
hardline 1 17 19
that 0 17 19
he 0 17 19
was 0 17 19
banned 0 17 19
from 0 17 19
preaching 0 17 19
in 0 17 19
Pakistan, 0 17 19
but 0 17 19
the 0 17 19
UK 0 17 19
Home 0 17 19
Office 0 17 19
welcomed 0 17 19
him 0 17 19
into 0 17 19
Britain. 0 17 19

The 0 17 20
UK 0 17 20
Home 0 17 20
Office 0 17 20
also 0 17 20
admitted 0 17 20
Shaykh 0 17 20
Hamza 0 17 20
Sodagar 0 17 20
into 0 17 20
the 0 17 20
country, 0 17 20
despite 0 17 20
the 0 17 20
fact 0 17 20
that 0 17 20
he 0 17 20
has 0 17 20
said: 0 17 20
“If 0 17 20
there’s 0 17 20
homosexual 0 17 20
men, 0 17 20
the 0 17 20
punishment 0 17 20
is 0 17 20
one 0 17 20
of 0 17 20
five 0 17 20
things. 0 17 20

One 0 17 21
– 0 17 21
the 0 17 21
easiest 0 17 21
one 0 17 21
maybe 0 17 21
– 0 17 21
chop 0 17 21
their 0 17 21
head 0 17 21
off, 0 17 21
that’s 0 17 21
the 0 17 21
easiest. 0 17 21

Second 0 17 22
– 0 17 22
burn 0 17 22
them 0 17 22
to 0 17 22
death. 0 17 22

Third 0 17 23
– 0 17 23
throw 0 17 23
’em 0 17 23
off 0 17 23
a 0 17 23
cliff. 0 17 23

Fourth 0 17 24
– 0 17 24
tear 0 17 24
down 0 17 24
a 0 17 24
wall 0 17 24
on 0 17 24
them 0 17 24
so 0 17 24
they 0 17 24
die 0 17 24
under 0 17 24
that. 0 17 24

Fifth 0 17 25
– 0 17 25
a 0 17 25
combination 0 17 25
of 0 17 25
the 0 17 25
above.” 0 17 25

Theresa 0 17 26
May’s 0 17 26
relentlessly 1 17 26
appeasement-minded 1 17 26
government 0 17 26
also 0 17 26
admitted 0 17 26
two 0 17 26
jihad 0 17 26
preachers 0 17 26
who 0 17 26
had 0 17 26
praised 0 17 26
the 0 17 26
murderer 0 17 26
of 0 17 26
a 0 17 26
foe 0 17 26
of 0 17 26
Pakistan’s 0 17 26
blasphemy 0 17 26
laws. 0 17 26

One 0 17 27
of 0 17 27
them 0 17 27
was 0 17 27
welcomed 0 17 27
by 0 17 27
the 0 17 27
Archbishop 0 17 27
of 0 17 27
Canterbury. 0 17 27

Meanwhile, 0 17 28
the 0 17 28
UK 0 17 28
banned 0 17 28
three 0 17 28
bishops 0 17 28
from 0 17 28
areas 0 17 28
of 0 17 28
Iraq 0 17 28
and 0 17 28
Syria 0 17 28
where 0 17 28
Christians 0 17 28
are 0 17 28
persecuted 0 17 28
from 0 17 28
entering 0 17 28
the 0 17 28
country. 0 17 28

But 0 17 29
now 0 17 29
matters 0 17 29
are 0 17 29
coming 0 17 29
to 0 17 29
a 0 17 29
head. 0 17 29

Apparently 0 17 30
British 0 17 30
authorities 0 17 30
decided 0 17 30
that 0 17 30
it 0 17 30
would 0 17 30
be 0 17 30
too 0 17 30
politically 0 17 30
costly 0 17 30
for 0 17 30
them 0 17 30
to 0 17 30
bar 0 17 30
Wilders 0 17 30
again. 0 17 30

And 0 17 31
so 0 17 31
he 0 17 31
entered, 0 17 31
and 0 17 31
spoke, 0 17 31
and 0 17 31
gave 0 17 31
them 0 17 31
a 0 17 31
strong 0 17 31
dose 0 17 31
of 0 17 31
the 0 17 31
reality 1 17 31
that 0 17 31
they 0 17 31
are 0 17 31
determined 0 17 31
to 0 17 31
ignore 0 17 31
and 0 17 31
deny. 0 17 31

Tommy 0 17 32
Robinson 0 17 32
is 0 17 32
in 0 17 32
prison 0 17 32
today 0 17 32
because 0 17 32
he 0 17 32
violated 0 17 32
a 0 17 32
court 0 17 32
order 0 17 32
demanding 0 17 32
that 0 17 32
he 0 17 32
not 0 17 32
film 0 17 32
videos 0 17 32
outside 0 17 32
the 0 17 32
trials 0 17 32
of 0 17 32
Muslim 1 17 32
rape 1 17 32
gangs. 1 17 32

Clearly 0 17 33
the 1 17 33
government’s 1 17 33
intent 1 17 33
was 1 17 33
to 1 17 33
make 1 17 33
sure 1 17 33
that 1 17 33
as 1 17 33
few 1 17 33
people 1 17 33
as 1 17 33
possible 1 17 33
discovered 1 17 33
the 1 17 33
truth 1 17 33
about 0 17 33
its 0 17 33
massive, 0 17 33
years-long 0 17 33
cover-up 0 17 33
of 0 17 33
those 0 17 33
rape 1 17 33
gangs, 1 17 33
and 0 17 33
refusal 0 17 33
to 0 17 33
prosecute 0 17 33
the 0 17 33
perpetrators. 0 17 33

Theresa 0 17 34
May 0 17 34
and 0 17 34
company 0 17 34
obvious 0 17 34
hope 0 17 34
that 0 17 34
other 0 17 34
Britons 0 17 34
who 0 17 34
are 0 17 34
furious 0 17 34
about 0 17 34
the 0 17 34
sacrifice 1 17 34
of 1 17 34
thousands 1 17 34
of 0 17 34
British 1 17 34
girls 1 17 34
to 0 17 34
the 0 17 34
idols 0 17 34
of 0 17 34
“diversity” 0 17 34
and 0 17 34
“multiculturalism” 0 17 34
will 0 17 34
see 0 17 34
what 0 17 34
happened 0 17 34
to 0 17 34
Tommy, 0 17 34
and 0 17 34
be 0 17 34
frightened 0 17 34
into 0 17 34
silence. 0 17 34

The 0 17 35
British 0 17 35
government, 0 17 35
in 0 17 35
imprisoning 0 17 35
Tommy 0 17 35
Robinson, 0 17 35
has 0 17 35
shown 0 17 35
itself 0 17 35
willing 0 17 35
to 0 17 35
incarcerate 0 17 35
people 0 17 35
for 0 17 35
having 0 17 35
opinions 0 17 35
that 0 17 35
it 0 17 35
considers 0 17 35
unacceptable. 0 17 35

That 0 17 36
heralds 0 17 36
the 1 17 36
death 1 17 36
of 1 17 36
Britain 1 17 36
as 1 17 36
a 1 17 36
free 1 17 36
society 1 17 36
and 0 17 36
the 0 17 36
beginning 1 17 36
of 1 17 36
an 1 17 36
authoritarian 1 17 36
police 1 17 36
state 1 17 36
there, 0 17 36
unless 1 17 36
this 1 17 36
slide 1 17 36
to 1 17 36
totalitarianism 1 17 36
is 1 17 36
stopped 1 17 36
now. 1 17 36

British 0 17 37
public 0 17 37
figures, 0 17 37
whatever 0 17 37
criticism 0 17 37
they 0 17 37
have 0 17 37
leveled 0 17 37
against 0 17 37
Tommy 0 17 37
Robinson 0 17 37
in 0 17 37
the 0 17 37
past, 0 17 37
should 0 17 37
be 0 17 37
calling 0 17 37
for 0 17 37
him 0 17 37
to 0 17 37
be 0 17 37
freed 0 17 37
today, 0 17 37
or 1 17 37
else 1 17 37
they 1 17 37
will 1 17 37
be 1 17 37
exposing 1 17 37
themselves 1 17 37
as 1 17 37
supporting 1 17 37
the 1 17 37
degeneration 1 17 37
of 1 17 37
Britain 1 17 37
into 0 17 37
a 0 17 37
police 0 17 37
state. 0 17 37

Wilders 0 17 38
addressed 0 17 38
this 0 17 38
endeavor 0 17 38
head-on, 0 17 38
declaring: 0 17 38
“We 1 17 38
will 1 17 38
not 1 17 38
be 1 17 38
silenced. 1 17 38

We 1 17 39
will 1 17 39
not 1 17 39
be 1 17 39
intimidated. 1 17 39

And 1 17 40
we 1 17 40
tell 1 17 40
the 1 17 40
governments, 1 17 40
we 1 17 40
are 1 17 40
not 1 17 40
afraid 1 17 40
of 1 17 40
you. 1 17 40

We 1 17 41
will 1 17 41
never 1 17 41
surrender. 1 17 41

We 1 17 42
will 1 17 42
stand 1 17 42
strong 1 17 42
and 1 17 42
do 1 17 42
our 1 17 42
duty. 1 17 42

We 1 17 43
will 1 17 43
defend 1 17 43
our 1 17 43
civilization. 1 17 43

And 1 17 44
we 1 17 44
will 1 17 44
protect 1 17 44
our 1 17 44
people.” 1 17 44

Wilders 0 17 45
added: 0 17 45
“And 0 17 45
I 0 17 45
tell 0 17 45
you, 0 17 45
to 0 17 45
the 0 17 45
governments. 0 17 45

You 0 17 46
can 0 17 46
throw 0 17 46
us 0 17 46
in 0 17 46
jail, 0 17 46
but 0 17 46
you 0 17 46
will 0 17 46
never 0 17 46
defeat 0 17 46
us. 0 17 46

Because, 0 17 47
my 0 17 47
friends, 0 17 47
for 0 17 47
every 0 17 47
Tommy 0 17 47
whom 0 17 47
you 0 17 47
imprison, 0 17 47
thousands 0 17 47
