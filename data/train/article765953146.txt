On 0
Monday, 0
DOJ 0
Inspector 0
General 0
Michael 0
Horowitz 0
testified 0
with 0
FBI 0
boss 0
Christopher 0
Wray 0
before 0
the 0
Senate 0
Judiciary 0
Committee. 0

In 0
a 0
predictable 0
performance, 0
the 0
duo 0
cited 0
mistakes 0
and 0
raised 0
concerns 0
but 0
solved 0
none 0
of 0
the 0
lingering 0
mysteries 0
the 0
massive 0
report 0
released 0
last 0
week 0
that 0
found 0
anti-Trump 0
bias 0
did 0
not 0
affect 0
FBI 0
and 0
DOJ 0
decisions. 0

On 0
Tuesday 0
Horowitz 0
performed 0
solo 0
before 0
a 0
joint 0
session 0
of 0
the 0
House 0
Oversight 0
and 0
Judiciary 0
Committees. 0

Oversight 0
chairman 0
Trey 0
Gowdy 0
delivered 0
the 0
opening 0
statement. 0

The 0
attorney 0
general 0
had 0
been 0
accused 0
of 0
“softening 0
or 0
watering 0
down 0
his 0
report,” 0
Gowdy 0
said, 0
“When 0
the 0
reality 0
is 0
it 0
was 0
Jim 0
Comey 0
who 0
softened 0
and 0
watered 0
down 0
his 0
press 0
release, 0
announcing 0
no 0
charges 0
against 0
Secretary 0
Clinton. 0

We 0
see 0
Jim 1
Comey 1
and 1
Jim 1
Comey 1
alone 1
deciding 0
which 0
DOJ 0
policies 0
to 0
follow 0
and 0
which 0
to 0
ignore, 0
to 0
decide 0
whether 0
there 0
is 0
sufficient 0
evidence 0
to 0
support 0
each 0
and 0
every 0
element 0
of 0
an 0
offense 0
and 0
we 0
see 0
Jim 1
Comey 1
and 1
Jim 1
Comey 1
alone 1
deciding 0
whether 0
to 0
send 0
a 0
letter 0
to 0
Congress 0
in 0
the 0
throes 0
of 0
looming 0
election.” 0

In 0
a 0
devastating 1
exchange 0
with 0
Horowitz, 0
Gowdy 0
said 0
that 0
“prejudging 0
the 0
outcome 0
of 0
an 0
investigation 0
before 0
it 0
ends, 0
and 0
prejudging 0
the 0
outcome 0
of 0
an 0
investigation 0
before 0
it 0
begins” 0
is 0
the 0
“textbook 0
definition 0
of 0
bias.” 0
Democrats 0
echoed 0
the 0
IG 0
report’s 0
conclusion 0
that 0
there 0
was 0
no 0
bias. 0

Republicans 0
sought 0
to 0
tie 0
up 0
some 0
loose 0
threads. 0

The 0
IG 0
report 0
confirmed 0
that 0
President 0
Obama 0
communicated 0
with 0
Hillary 0
Clinton 0
on 0
her 0
unsecured 0
email 0
system. 0

Horowitz 0
said 0
the 0
president 0
had 0
been 0
one 0
of 0
13 0
who 0
had 0
done 0
so. 0

Rep. 0
Steve 0
King 0
asked 0
about 0
the 0
volume 0
of 0
communications 0
between 0
the 0
president 0
and 0
Clinton. 0

“I’ll 0
have 0
to 0
get 0
back 0
to 0
you 0
on 0
that,” 0
Horowitz 0
said, 0
and 0
the 0
IG 0
was 0
“not 0
sure” 0
if 0
any 0
of 0
the 0
communications 0
had 0
involved 0
classified 0
or 0
top 0
secret 0
material. 0

If 0
the 0
IG 0
did 0
know 0
the 0
subject 0
of 0
the 0
president’s 0
communications 0
with 0
Clinton, 0
he 0
failed 0
to 0
reveal 0
any 0
details. 0

Horowitz 0
“would 0
have 0
to 0
ask” 0
if 0
his 0
team 0
interviewed 0
any 0
officials 0
at 0
the 0
Obama 0
White 0
House 0
but 0
said 0
“not 0
the 0
president 0
himself.” 0

Rep. 0
King 0
asked 0
Horowitz 0
about 0
his 0
first 0
encounter 0
with 0
the 0
switch 0
of 0
“extremely 1
careless” 1
for 0
‘gross 1
negligence,” 1
which 0
violated 0
a 0
criminal 0
statute. 0

Horowitz 0
found 0
that 0
Peter 0
Strzok, 0
Lisa 0
Page, 0
and 0
James 0
Comey 0
were 0
all 0
involved. 0

The 0
IG 0
also 0
said 0
his 0
team 0
focused 0
on 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
the 0
classified 0
material 0
on 0
Clinton’s 0
server 0
was 0
“not 0
clearly 0
marked,” 0
which 0
repeated 0
one 0
of 0
Clinton’s 0
claims 0
about 0
her 0
negligence. 1

As 0
for 0
the 0
question 0
of 0
her 0
“intent,” 0
Horowitz 0
said 0
it 0
arose 0
“months 0
earlier,” 0
maybe 0
in 0
2015, 0
though 0
he 0
couldn’t 0
be 0
sure. 0

King 0
said 0
President 0
Obama 0
had 0
suggested 0
the 0
“careless 0
but 0
not 0
intentional” 0
language 0
in 0
a 0
“60 0
Minutes” 0
appearance 0
in 0
October 0
of 0
2015. 0

And 0
King 0
had 0
observed 0
that 0
in 0
his 0
July 0
5, 0
2016 0
statement, 0
James 0
Comey 0
used 0
“intent” 0
six 0
times. 0

Horowitz 0
said 0
Comey 0
“concealed 0
from 0
the 0
attorney 0
general 0
and 0
the 0
deputy 0
attorney 0
general, 0
his 0
intention 0
to 0
make 0
a 0
unilateral 0
announcement 0
in 0
July 0
2016 0
about 0
the 0
reasons 0
for 0
his 0
recommendations 0
not 0
to 0
prosecute 0
former 0
Secretary 0
Clinton.” 0
The 0
IG 0
also 0
described 0
his 0
report 0
as 0
a 0
“thorough, 0
comprehensive 0
and 0
objective 0
recitation 0
of 0
the 0
facts.” 0

The 0
IG 0
did 0
confirm 0
that 0
Peter 0
Strzok 0
and 0
Lisa 0
Page 0
worked 0
on 0
the 0
Clinton 0
investigation, 0
the 0
Russia 0
and 0
the 0
Mueller 0
team. 0

Horowitz 0
said 0
Strzok 0
and 0
Page 0
had 0
exchanged 0
“tens 0
of 0
thousands 0
of 0
texts.” 0
Ohio 0
Rep. 0
James 0
Jordan 0
asked 0
Horowitz 0
when 0
his 0
team 0
had 0
discovered 0
the 0
message 0
about 0
“we’ll 0
stop” 0
Trump. 0

Horowitz 0
conceded 0
that 0
this 0
meant 0
“stop 0
Trump 0
from 0
becoming 0
president.” 0
The 0
IG 0
said 0
they 0
uncovered 0
that 0
text 0
in 0
May, 0
and 0
Jordan 0
asked 0
“why 0
did 0
we 0
not 0
see 0
it 0
until 0
last 0
Thursday?” 0

“I 0
can’t 0
answer 0
that,” 0
Horowitz 0
said, 0
adding 0
that 0
it 0
had 0
been 0
sent 0
to 0
Rod 0
Rosenstein’s 0
department 0
at 0
the 0
DOJ. 0

Jordan 0
concluded 0
that 0
Rosenstein 0
“made 0
the 0
decision 0
that 0
we 0
had 0
to 0
wait 0
a 0
month.” 0

Several 0
representatives 0
were 0
curious 0
about 0
two 0
FBI 0
agents 0
and 0
one 0
lawyer 0
the 0
IG 0
report 0
had 0
not 0
named. 0

“The 0
FBI 0
raised 0
a 0
concern 0
because 0
they 0
work 0
on 0
counterintelligence 0
matters,” 0
Horowitz 0
said. 0

Rep 0
Mark 0
Meadows 0
asked 0
if 0
the 0
two 0
FBI 0
agents 0
were 0
Kevin 0
Clinesmith 0
and 0
Sally 0
Moyer, 0
which 0
the 0
IG 0
declined 0
to 0
confirm. 0

“They 0
don’t 0
work 0
in 0
counterintelligence,” 0
said 0
Meadows, 0
who 0
charged 0
that 0
the 0
FBI 0
gave 0
the 0
IG 0
“false 0
information” 0
and 0
altered 0
key 0
witness 0
reports. 0

“How 0
did 0
Comey 0
see 0
the 0
report 0
before 0
it 0
came 0
out?” 0
Rep. 0
Darrell 0
Issa 0
wanted 0
to 0
know. 0

Horowitz 0
said 0
Comey 0
didn’t 0
see 0
the 0
whole 0
thing, 0
but 0
explained 0
that 0
he 0
allowed 0
those 0
the 0
IG 0
team 0
had 0
criticized 0
to 0
have 0
a 0
look 0
before 0
release. 0

By 0
the 0
end 0
of 0
the 0
day 0
it 0
was 0
evident 0
that 0
Congress 0
would 0
have 0
to 0
hear 0
from 0
Comey, 0
Rosenstein, 0
Strzok 0
and 0
others. 0

Horowitz 0
confirmed 0
that 0
the 0
IG 0
is 0
investigating 0
whether 0
FBI 0
official 0
Peter 0
Strzok’s 0
anti-Trump 0
bias 0
factored 0
into 0
the 0
launch 0
of 0
the 0
bureau’s 0
Russia 0
probe. 0

Also 0
on 0
Tuesday 0
Peter 0
Strzok 0
was 0
“escorted” 0
from 0
the 0
FBI 0
building. 0

As 0
his 0
lawyer 0
told 0
reporters, 0
Strzok 0
had 0
“played 0
by 0
the 0
rules,” 0
but 0
been 0
targeted 0
by 0
“unfounded 0
personal 0
attacks, 0
political 0
games 0
and 0
inappropriate 0
information 0
leaks.” 0

“I 0
hope 0
he 0
comes 0
and 0
portrays 0
himself 0
as 0
a 0
victim,” 0
Trey 0
Gowdy 0
told 0
Fox 0
News. 0

Rep. 0
Bob 0
Goodlatte 0
said 0
the 0
committee 0
would 0
issue 0
a 0
subpoena 0
for 0
Strzok 0
to 0
testify 0
“next 0
week.” 0

That 0
will 0
make 0
for 0
an 0
exciting 0
show 0
on 0
C-SPAN 0
but 0
none 0
of 0
this 0
would 0
be 0
happening 0
if 0
the 0
deep 1
state 1
plot 1
to 0
“stop” 0
Trump 0
had 0
succeeded. 0
