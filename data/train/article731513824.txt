The 0
Diocese 0
of 0
Linz, 0
Austria, 0
invited 0
homosexual 0
couples 0
to 0
participate 0
in 0
the 0
blessing 0
of 0
couples 0
on 0
St. 0
Valentine's 0
Day. 0

The 0
move 0
comes 0
in 0
the 0
wake 0
of 0
the 0
recent 0
debate 0
over 0
the 0
German 0
bishops' 0
initiative 0
to 0
bless 0
homosexual 0
couples, 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
the 0
controversy 0
over 0
Bishop 0
Andreas 0
Laun's 0
own 0
criticism 0
of 0
it. 0

The 0
diocese’s 0
own 0
media 0
report 0
makes 0
a 0
reference 0
to 0
Amoris 0
Laetitia, 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
to 0
Cardinal 0
Reinhard 0
Marx's 0
recent 0
initiative. 0

The 0
official 0
diocesan 0
newspaper, 0
KirchenZeitung, 0
announced 0
on 0
February 0
9 0
that 0
in 0
two 0
different 0
parishes 0
in 0
the 0
Diocese 0
of 0
Linz 0
homosexual 0
couples 0
were 0
explicitly 0
invited 0
to 0
receive 0
a 0
Church 0
blessing 0
on 0
St. 0
Valentine's 0
Day. 0

As 0
is 0
explained 0
in 0
the 0
article: 0

St. 0
Valentine 0
is 0
known 0
as 0
the 0
saint 0
of 0
friendship 0
and 0
of 0
love. 0

In 0
many 0
parishes 0
and 0
ecclesial 0
institutions, 0
it 0
is 0
already 0
tradition 0
to 0
offer 0
blessings 0
of 0
couples 0
around 0
the 0
time 0
of 0
his 0
feast 0
day. 0

People 0
in 0
homosexual 0
relationships 0
are 0
welcome 0
at 0
the 0
blessing 0
ceremonies 0
in 0
Wels-St. 0
Franziskus 0
[Church] 0
and 0
in 0
the 0
Ursulinenkirche. 0

Paul 0
Stütz, 0
the 0
author 0
of 0
the 0
article, 0
explains 0
that 0
the 0
blessing 0
of 0
couples 0
“offers 0
an 0
occasion 0
to 0
express 0
love.” 0

“The 0
blessing 0
expresses 0
that 0
one 0
is 0
welcomed 0
by 0
one's 0
partner 0
and 0
by 0
God.” 0
At 0
the 0
end 0
of 0
his 0
article, 0
he 0
adds 0
a 0
link 0
to 0
another 0
report 0
about 0
Cardinal 0
Reinhard 0
Marx's 0
recent 0
3 0
February 0
interview 0
showing 0
his 0
openness 0
to 0
the 0
idea 0
of 0
blessings 0
of 0
homosexual 0
couples 0
in 0
individual 0
cases 0
as 0
decided 0
by 0
a 0
pastor. 0

Stütz 1
also 1
quotes 1
in 1
the 1
article 1
itself 1
Father 1
Franz 1
Harant, 1
“a 1
pastoral 1
worker 1
in 1
the 1
field 1
of 1
marriage 1
and 1
the 1
family” 1
at 1
the 1
Ursulinenkirche 1
in 1
Linz. 1

Harant 1
himself 1
shows 1
himself 1
a 1
supporter 1
of 1
blessings 1
for 1
homosexual 1
couples, 1
and 1
he 1
makes 1
here 1
an 1
explicit 1
reference 1
to 1
Amoris 1
Laetitia. 1

As 0
Stütz 0
reports: 0

We 0
give 0
out 0
that 0
universally 0
available 0
blessing. 0

There, 0
we 0
have 0
nothing 0
to 0
forbid,” 0
says 0
Harant. 0

He 1
sees 1
himself 1
in 1
this 1
in 1
union 1
with 1
Pope 1
Francis 1
who 1
himself 1
says 1
in 1
his 1
magisterial 1
document 1
Amoris 1
Laetitia 1
that 1
“each 1
person, 1
independent 1
of 1
his 1
sexual 1
orientation, 1
is 1
to 1
be 1
respected 1
in 1
his 1
dignity 1
and 1
welcomed 1
with 1
respect. 1

As 0
the 0
Austrian 0
Catholic 0
website 0
Kath.net 0
writes, 0
Harant 0
must 0
be 0
quoting 0
here 0
AL 0
250. 0

Irmgard 0
Lehner, 0
the 0
pastoral 0
assistant 0
of 0
the 0
Wels-St. 0
Franziskus 0
Church, 0
the 0
other 0
of 0
the 0
two 0
parishes 0
that 0
welcome 0
homosexual 0
couples, 0
appreciates 0
this 0
blessing 0
ritual 0
for 0
Valentine's 0
Day, 0
saying 0
it 1
has 1
“an 1
enormous 1
power.” 1
During 0
the 0
ceremony, 0
couples 0
come 0
forward 0
in 0
church 0
and 0
receive 0
a 0
hand 0
on 0
their 0
foreheads 0
and 0
a 0
sign 0
of 0
the 0
cross. 0

“We 0
thus 0
stress 0
the 0
high 0
value 0
of 0
relationships,” 0
explains 0
Lehner. 0

As 0
the 0
KirchenZeitung 0
journalist 0
adds: 0
“This 0
offer 0
can 0
be 0
accepted 0
by 0
lovers 0
in 0
all 0
kinds 0
of 0
life 0
situations 0
– 0
also 0
by 0
lesbians 0
and 0
homosexuals.” 0
Lehner, 0
who 0
is 0
herself 0
a 0
theologian, 0
regrets 0
that, 0
so 0
far, 0
no 0
homosexual 0
couple 0
has 0
come 0
for 0
the 0
blessing. 0

“Here 0
with 0
us, 0
everybody 0
should 0
feel 0
welcome, 0
just 0
as 0
he 0
or 0
she 0
is.” 0
The 0
pastoral 0
assistant 0
adds 0
that 0
“God 0
is 0
love. 0

There 0
are 0
no 0
restrictions.” 0

The 0
Diocesan 0
Working 0
Group 0
on 0
Pastoral 0
Care 0
for 0
Homosexuals 0
(dahop) 0
is 0
rejoicing 0
about 0
such 0
a 0
welcome 0
from 0
a 0
parish. 0

The 0
group 0
says 0
that 0
it 0
repeatedly 0
receives 0
requests 0
from 0
homosexual 0
couples 0
who 0
wish 0
to 0
“receive 0
a 0
blessing 0
in 0
the 0
frame 0
of 0
a 0
liturgy.” 0

The 0
KirchenZeitung 0
then 0
quotes 0
a 0
commentary, 0
saying: 0

It 0
would 0
be 0
good 0
if 0
a 0
clear 0
sign 0
of 0
openness 0
and 0
invitation 0
would 0
be 0
made 0
by 0
many 0
more 0
pastoral 0
workers 0
[male 0
and 0
female], 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
give 0
the 0
clear 0
signal 0
that 0
love 0
between 0
two 0
persons 0
with 0
equal 0
rights 0
are 0
wished 0
by 0
God 0
and 0
thus 0
already 0
blessed. 0

Moreover, 0
the 0
above-quoted 0
Franz 0
Harant 0
himself 0
is 0
the 0
contact 0
person 0
of 0
this 0
Diocesan 0
Working 0
Group 0
– 0
also 0
called 0
“Rainbow 0
Pastoral.” 0
As 0
can 0
be 0
seen 0
on 0
the 0
website 0
of 0
dahop, 0
the 0
Diocese 0
of 0
Linz 0
offers 0
special 0
liturgical 0
services 0
for 0
homosexuals, 0
called 0
“Queer 0
Church 0
Services” 0
(Queer-Gottesdienste) 0
that 0
take 0
place 0
in 0
Harant's 0
own 0
parish. 0

It 0
is 0
not 0
clear 0
whether 0
these 0
church 0
services 0
take 0
place 0
in 0
a 0
form 0
of 0
a 0
Holy 0
Mass. 0

Similar 0
blessings 0
for 0
homosexual 0
couples 0
are 0
currently 0
taking 0
place, 0
or 0
are 0
being 0
considered, 0
also 0
in 0
Gemany, 0
some 0
of 0
them 0
on 0
the 0
diocesan 0
level, 0
some 0
of 0
them 0
on 0
an 0
individual 0
level. 0

As 0
LifeSiteNews 0
reported 0
in 0
January, 0
the 0
Diocese 0
of 0
Limburg 0
is 0
publicly 0
discussing 0
the 0
establishment 0
of 0
a 0
special 0
liturgical 0
rite 0
for 0
the 0
blessing 0
of 0
homosexuals. 0

Publicly 0
presented 0
by 0
Johannes 0
zu 0
Eltz, 0
a 0
high-ranking 0
priest 0
of 0
the 0
diocese, 0
his 0
so-called 0
Frankfurt 0
proposal 0
has 0
the 0
public 0
support 0
of 0
the 0
local 0
bishop, 0
Georg 0
Bätzing. 0

Additionally, 0
the 0
Austrian 0
Catholic 0
website 0
Kath.net 0
reports 0
that 0
there 0
are 0
two 0
Catholics 0
priests 0
in 0
two 0
different 0
German 0
dioceses 0
who 0
publicly 0
state 0
now 0
to 0
have 0
given 0
many 0
blessings 0
to 0
homosexual 0
couples. 0

Father 0
Christoph 0
Simonsen 0
(Diocese 0
of 0
Aachen) 0
says 0
that 0
he 0
has 0
blessed 0
50 0
couples 0
in 0
the 0
last 0
fifteen 0
years; 0
Father 0
Siegfried 0
Modenbach 0
(Archdiocese 0
of 0
Paderborn) 0
has 0
blessed 0
two 0
homosexual 0
couples 0
in 0
the 0
last 0
years. 0

He 0
also 0
conducts 0
church 0
services 0
for 0
homosexuals. 0

Kath.net 0
subsequently 0
contacted 0
both 0
Dioceses 0
and 0
requested 0
information 0
about 0
these 0
two 0
priests. 0

As 0
an 0
answer, 0
they 0
were 0
told 0
that 0
the 0
Diocese 0
intends 0
to 0
talk 0
with 0
the 0
concerned 0
priests, 0
but 0
that 0
this 0
matter 0
needs 0
to 0
be 0
addressed 0
among 0
the 0
German 0
bishops 0
in 0
general, 0
such 0
as 0
in 0
the 0
German 0
Bishops' 0
Conference. 0

This 0
moral 0
turmoil 0
in 0
German 0
dioceses 0
has 0
provoked 0
concern 0
and 0
criticism 0
among 0
Catholics. 0

Mathias 0
von 0
Gersdorff, 0
German 0
pro-life 0
activist 0
and 0
book 0
author, 0
states 0
on 0
his 0
own 0
blog, 0
the 0
upcoming 0
Spring 0
Assembly 0
of 0
the 0
German 0
Bishops' 0
Conference 0
will 0
become 0
crucial 0
in 0
this 0
matter. 0

As 0
he 0
sees 0
it, 0
“the 0
bishops 0
of 0
Germany 0
who 0
will 0
meet 0
next 0
week 0
for 0
the 0
Spring 0
Assembly 0
of 0
the 0
Bishops' 0
Conference 0
find 0
themselves 0
in 0
a 0
complicated 0
situation,” 0
where 0
they 0
will 0
have 0
to 0
show 0
their 0
colors. 0

They 0
will 0
either 0
be 0
in 0
favor 0
of 0
the 0
Catholic 0
Church's 0
teaching 0
on 0
sexuality 0
and 0
marriage 0
and 0
forbid 0
such 0
blessings, 0
or 0
“essentially 0
accept 0
them,” 0
at 0
least 0
by 0
“saying 0
nothing.” 0

He 0
concludes: 0
