Patel 0 84 3
was 0 84 3
one 0 84 3
of 0 84 3
the 0 84 3
main 0 84 3
events 0 84 3
promoted 0 84 3
beforehand. 0 84 3

However, 0 84 4
his 0 84 4
jokes 0 84 4
quickly 0 84 4
progressed 0 84 4
to 0 84 4
uncomfortable 0 84 4
territory, 0 84 4
including 0 84 4
one 0 84 4
about 0 84 4
a 0 84 4
gay 0 84 4

man 0 84 4
who 0 84 4
lives 0 84 4
in 0 84 4
his 0 84 4
neighborhood 0 84 4

how 0 84 4
“[I]t 0 84 4
made 0 84 4
me 0 84 4
realize 0 84 4
that 0 84 4
being 0 84 4
gay 0 84 4
is 0 84 4
definitely 0 84 4
not 0 84 4
a 0 84 4
choice 0 84 4
because 1 84 4
no 1 84 4
one 1 84 4
wants 1 84 4
to 1 84 4
be 1 84 4
gay 1 84 4
and 1 84 4
black.” 1 84 4
The 0 84 4
tension 0 84 4
in 0 84 4
the 0 84 4
room 0 84 4
increased 0 84 4
as 0 84 4
Patel 0 84 4
told 0 84 4
more 0 84 4
jokes 0 84 4
in 0 84 4
this 0 84 4
vein 0 84 4
until 0 84 4
organizers 0 84 4
of 0 84 4
the 0 84 4
event 0 84 4
went 0 84 4
up 0 84 4
on 0 84 4
stage 0 84 4
to 0 84 4
stop 0 84 4
him, 0 84 4
citing 0 84 4
a 0 84 4
change 0 84 4
in 0 84 4
program 0 84 4
plans. 0 84 4

Patel 0 84 5
questioned 0 84 5
why 0 84 5
this 0 84 5
was 0 84 5
happening. 0 84 5

The 0 84 6
organizers 0 84 6
replied 0 84 6
that 0 84 6
the 0 84 6
person 0 84 6
in 0 84 6
charge 0 84 6
of 0 84 6
tech 0 84 6
had 0 84 6
to 0 84 6
leave 0 84 6
early, 0 84 6
but 0 84 6
Patel 0 84 6
continued 0 84 6
to 0 84 6
claim 0 84 6
that 0 84 6
he 0 84 6
was 0 84 6
being 0 84 6
cut 0 84 6
off 0 84 6
because 0 84 6
the 0 84 6
audience 0 84 6
didn’t 0 84 6
like 0 84 6
his 0 84 6
jokes. 0 84 6

At 0 84 7
one 0 84 7
point, 0 84 7
one 0 84 7
organizer 0 84 7
told 0 84 7
Patel 0 84 7
he 0 84 7
was 0 84 7
being 0 84 7
disrespectful. 0 84 7

When 0 84 8
asked 0 84 8
for 0 84 8
closing 0 84 8
remarks, 0 84 8
Patel 0 84 8
responded: 0 84 8
“I’m 1 84 8
a 1 84 8
generation 1 84 8
older 1 84 8
than 1 84 8
all 1 84 8
of 1 84 8
you 1 84 8
I 1 84 8
know 1 84 8
comedy,” 1 84 8
and 0 84 8
called 0 84 8
the 0 84 8

incorrect 0 84 8
in 0 84 8
ending 0 84 8
his 0 84 8

tried 0 84 9
to 0 84 9
continue 0 84 9
speaking 0 84 9
until 0 84 9
his 0 84 9
mic 0 84 9
was 0 84 9
cut. 0 84 9
