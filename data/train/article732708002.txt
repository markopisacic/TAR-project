Last 0 177 1
week 0 177 1
Pope 0 177 1

The 0 177 2
issue 0 177 2
has 0 177 2
dogged 0 177 2
the 0 177 2
Roman 0 177 2
Catholic 0 177 2
Church 0 177 2
in 0 177 2
recent 0 177 2

Here’s 0 177 3
a 0 177 3
look 0 177 3
what 0 177 3
drove 0 177 3
the 0 177 3
panel’s 0 177 3
creation 0 177 3
and 0 177 3
what 0 177 3
to 0 177 3

What 0 177 4
is 0 177 4
Pope 0 177 4
Francis’ 0 177 4
commission 0 177 4
on 0 177 4
sexual 0 177 4
abuse? 0 177 4

Following 0 177 5
criticism 0 177 5
he 0 177 5
was 0 177 5
not 0 177 5
focusing 0 177 5
on 0 177 5
halting 0 177 5
child 0 177 5
abuse 0 177 5
within 0 177 5
the 0 177 5
church, 0 177 5
Francis 0 177 5
created 0 177 5
the 0 177 5
Pontifical 0 177 5
Commission 0 177 5
for 0 177 5
the 0 177 5
Protection 0 177 5
of 0 177 5
Minors 0 177 5

March 0 177 5
2014, 0 177 5

Cardinal 0 177 5
Sean 0 177 5
O’Malley, 0 177 5
the 0 177 5
archbishop 0 177 5
of 0 177 5
Boston, 0 177 5
to 0 177 5
run 0 177 5
it. 0 177 5

O’Malley 0 177 6
was 0 177 6
not 0 177 6
only 0 177 6
a 0 177 6
member 0 177 6
of 0 177 6
the 0 177 6
pope’s 0 177 6
“G9” 0 177 6
group 0 177 6
of 0 177 6
close 0 177 6
advisors; 0 177 6
he 0 177 6
was 0 177 6
also 0 177 6
the 0 177 6
man 0 177 6
who 0 177 6
sought 0 177 6
to 0 177 6
clean 0 177 6
up 0 177 6
the 0 177 6
abuse 0 177 6
scandal 0 177 6
in 0 177 6
Boston 0 177 6
after 0 177 6
the 0 177 6
departure 0 177 6
of 0 177 6
his 0 177 6
predecessor, 0 177 6
Cardinal 0 177 6
Bernard 0 177 6
Law, 0 177 6
whose 0 177 6
shifting 0 177 6
of 0 177 6
predator 0 177 6
priests 0 177 6
to 0 177 6
new 0 177 6
posts 0 177 6

exposed 0 177 6
by 0 177 6
the 0 177 6
Boston 0 177 6
Globe 0 177 6
and 0 177 6
chronicled 0 177 6
in 0 177 6
the 0 177 6
movie 0 177 6
“Spotlight.” 0 177 6

The 0 177 7
revelations 0 177 7
about 0 177 7
Law, 0 177 7
who 0 177 7
died 0 177 7
in 0 177 7
December, 0 177 7
emboldened 0 177 7

victims 0 177 7
across 0 177 7
the 0 177 7
country 0 177 7
and 0 177 7
world, 0 177 7
who 0 177 7
began 0 177 7
speaking 0 177 7
up 0 177 7
about 0 177 7
the 0 177 7
priests 0 177 7
who 0 177 7
had 0 177 7
molested 0 177 7
them. 0 177 7

When 0 177 8
he 0 177 8
created 0 177 8
the 0 177 8
commission, 0 177 8
Francis 0 177 8
said: 0 177 8
“The 0 177 8
commission’s 0 177 8
specific 0 177 8
task 0 177 8
is 0 177 8
to 0 177 8
propose 0 177 8
to 0 177 8
me 0 177 8
the 0 177 8
most 0 177 8
opportune 0 177 8
initiatives 0 177 8
for 0 177 8
protecting 0 177 8
minors 0 177 8
and 0 177 8
vulnerable 0 177 8
adults, 0 177 8
in 0 177 8
order 0 177 8
that 0 177 8
we 0 177 8
may 0 177 8
do 0 177 8
everything 0 177 8
possible 0 177 8
to 0 177 8
ensure 0 177 8
that 0 177 8
crimes 0 177 8
such 0 177 8
as 0 177 8
those 0 177 8
which 0 177 8
have 0 177 8
occurred 0 177 8
are 0 177 8
no 0 177 8
longer 0 177 8
repeated 0 177 8
in 0 177 8
the 0 177 8
Church.” 0 177 8

Why 0 177 9
is 0 177 9
it 0 177 9
being 0 177 9
renewed 0 177 9
now? 0 177 9

After 0 177 10
the 0 177 10
commission’s 0 177 10
three-year 0 177 10
mandate 0 177 10
expired 0 177 10
in 0 177 10
December, 0 177 10
Francis 0 177 10
relaunched 0 177 10
it 0 177 10
on 0 177 10
Feb. 0 177 10
17 0 177 10
with 0 177 10
some 0 177 10
members 0 177 10
reappointed 0 177 10
and 0 177 10
nine 0 177 10
new 0 177 10
members 0 177 10
added, 0 177 10
some 0 177 10
of 0 177 10
whom 0 177 10
are 0 177 10
victims 0 177 10
of 0 177 10
abuse, 0 177 10
although 0 177 10
the 0 177 10
Vatican 0 177 10
declined 0 177 10
to 0 177 10
say 0 177 10
which, 0 177 10
opting 0 177 10

O’Malley 0 177 11
returns 0 177 11
as 0 177 11
chief. 0 177 11

New 0 177 12

from 0 177 12
Australia, 0 177 12
Brazil, 0 177 12
Ethiopia, 0 177 12
India, 0 177 12
the 0 177 12
Netherlands 0 177 12
and 0 177 12
Tonga, 0 177 12
"reflecting 0 177 12

global 0 177 12
reach 0 177 12
of 0 177 12
the 0 177 12

the 0 177 12

in 0 177 12
diverse 0 177 12
cultural 0 177 12
context,” 0 177 12
the 0 177 12
Vatican 0 177 12
said. 0 177 12

What 0 177 13
did 0 177 13
the 0 177 13
first 0 177 13
commission 0 177 13
achieve? 0 177 13

The 0 177 14
Vatican 0 177 14
has 0 177 14
said 0 177 14
it 0 177 14
“worked 0 177 14
with 0 177 14
almost 0 177 14
200 0 177 14
dioceses 0 177 14
and 0 177 14
religious 0 177 14
communities 0 177 14
worldwide 0 177 14
to 0 177 14
raise 0 177 14
awareness 0 177 14
and 0 177 14
to 0 177 14
educate 0 177 14
people 0 177 14
on 0 177 14
the 0 177 14
need 0 177 14
for 0 177 14
safeguarding 0 177 14
in 0 177 14
our 0 177 14
homes, 0 177 14
parishes, 0 177 14
schools, 0 177 14
hospitals, 0 177 14
and 0 177 14
other 0 177 14
institutions.” 0 177 14

What 0 177 15
didn’t 0 177 15
it 0 177 15
do? 0 177 15

Commission 0 177 16
members 0 177 16
quickly 0 177 16
realized 0 177 16
they 0 177 16
needed 0 177 16
to 0 177 16
go 0 177 16
beyond 0 177 16
raising 0 177 16
awareness 0 177 16
and 0 177 16
deal 0 177 16
with 0 177 16
the 0 177 16
bishops 0 177 16
who 0 177 16
quietly 0 177 16
shift 0 177 16
offenders 0 177 16
to 0 177 16
new 0 177 16
dioceses 0 177 16
when 0 177 16
they 0 177 16
are 0 177 16
exposed 0 177 16
as 0 177 16
molesters 0 177 16
and 0 177 16
rapists. 0 177 16

Even 0 177 17
if 0 177 17
church 0 177 17
laws 0 177 17
already 0 177 17
existed 0 177 17
to 0 177 17
hold 0 177 17
bishops 0 177 17
accountable 0 177 17
for 0 177 17
their 0 177 17
priests’ 0 177 17
behavior, 0 177 17
those 0 177 17
strictures 0 177 17
were 0 177 17
not 0 177 17
enough, 0 177 17
O’Malley 0 177 17
said 0 177 17
in 0 177 17
2014. 0 177 17

“There 0 177 18
are, 0 177 18
theoretically 0 177 18
I 0 177 18
guess, 0 177 18
canons 0 177 18
that 0 177 18
could 0 177 18
apply 0 177 18
here, 0 177 18
but 0 177 18
obviously 0 177 18
they 0 177 18
have 0 177 18
not 0 177 18
been 0 177 18
sufficient,” 0 177 18
he 0 177 18
said. 0 177 18

The 0 177 19
commission 0 177 19
was 0 177 19
behind 0 177 19
Francis’ 0 177 19
decision 0 177 19
in 0 177 19
2015 0 177 19
to 0 177 19
create 0 177 19
a 0 177 19
new 0 177 19
tribunal 0 177 19
to 0 177 19
judge 0 177 19
bishops 0 177 19
caught 0 177 19
covering 0 177 19
up 0 177 19
for 0 177 19
abusive 1 177 19
priests, 1 177 19
and 0 177 19
to 0 177 19
fund 0 177 19
it 0 177 19
for 0 177 19
five 0 177 19
years. 0 177 19

But 0 177 20
amid 0 177 20
myriad 0 177 20
legal 0 177 20
questions 0 177 20
over 0 177 20
what 0 177 20
exact 0 177 20
powers 0 177 20
the 0 177 20
court 0 177 20
would 0 177 20
have, 0 177 20
it 0 177 20
never 0 177 20
got 0 177 20
off 0 177 20
the 0 177 20
ground. 0 177 20

In 0 177 21
2016, 0 177 21
Francis 0 177 21
officially 0 177 21
killed 0 177 21
the 0 177 21
plan 0 177 21
to 0 177 21
create 0 177 21
it, 0 177 21
issuing 0 177 21
a 0 177 21
document 0 177 21
that 0 177 21
essentially 0 177 21
called 0 177 21
on 0 177 21
using 0 177 21
existing 0 177 21
procedures 0 177 21
to 0 177 21
tackle 0 177 21
the 0 177 21
problem. 0 177 21

Francis 0 177 22
was 0 177 22
also 0 177 22
criticized 0 177 22
when 0 177 22
Australian 0 177 22
Cardinal 0 177 22
George 0 177 22
Pell, 0 177 22
whom 0 177 22
he 0 177 22
had 0 177 22
brought 0 177 22
to 0 177 22
Rome 0 177 22
to 0 177 22
clean 0 177 22
up 0 177 22
Vatican 0 177 22
finances, 0 177 22
was 0 177 22
forced 0 177 22
to 0 177 22
return 0 177 22
to 0 177 22
Australia 0 177 22
last 0 177 22
year 0 177 22
to 0 177 22
face 0 177 22
charges 0 177 22
of 0 177 22
sexual 0 177 22
assault. 0 177 22

Any 0 177 23
other 0 177 23
problems? 0 177 23

Commission 0 177 24
members 0 177 24
said 0 177 24
bishops 0 177 24
should 0 177 24
call 0 177 24
the 0 177 24
police 0 177 24
when 0 177 24
they 0 177 24
discovered 0 177 24
predator 1 177 24
priests, 1 177 24
rather 0 177 24
than 0 177 24
phone 0 177 24
the 0 177 24
nearest 0 177 24
religious 0 177 24
retreat 0 177 24
to 0 177 24
“park” 1 177 24
the 1 177 24
priest 1 177 24
out 1 177 24
of 1 177 24
harm’s 1 177 24
way. 1 177 24

But 0 177 25
this 0 177 25
simple 0 177 25
message 0 177 25
was 0 177 25
hard 0 177 25
to 0 177 25
get 0 177 25
across. 0 177 25

It 0 177 26
emerged 0 177 26
that 0 177 26
during 0 177 26
a 0 177 26
Vatican 0 177 26
training 0 177 26
course 0 177 26
for 0 177 26
new 0 177 26
bishops 0 177 26
in 0 177 26
September 0 177 26
2015 0 177 26
a 0 177 26
French 0 177 26
priest 0 177 26
informed 0 177 26
bishops 0 177 26
they 0 177 26
had 0 177 26
no 0 177 26
obligation 0 177 26
to 0 177 26
report 0 177 26
abuse 0 177 26
to 0 177 26
the 0 177 26
police, 0 177 26
forcing 0 177 26
the 0 177 26
commission 0 177 26
to 0 177 26
issue 0 177 26
a 0 177 26
strong 0 177 26
statement 0 177 26
saying 0 177 26
bishops 0 177 26
had 0 177 26
every 0 177 26
obligation 0 177 26
to 0 177 26
do 0 177 26
so. 0 177 26

Did 0 177 27
commission 0 177 27
members 0 177 27
persevere? 0 177 27

Not 0 177 28
all 0 177 28
of 0 177 28
them. 0 177 28

British 0 177 29
member 0 177 29
Peter 0 177 29
Saunders, 0 177 29
a 0 177 29
former 0 177 29
victim 0 177 29
of 0 177 29
priestly 0 177 29
abuse, 0 177 29
was 0 177 29
ousted 0 177 29
in 0 177 29
2016. 0 177 29

He 0 177 30
said 0 177 30
the 0 177 30
group 0 177 30

up 0 177 37
by 0 177 37

a 0 177 37

appointment 0 177 37
as 0 177 37
a 0 177 37
bishop 0 177 37
in 0 177 37
2015 0 177 37
prompted 0 177 37
huge 0 177 37
protests 0 177 37
in 0 177 37
Chile. 0 177 37

The 0 177 38
pope 0 177 38
has 0 177 38
stuck 0 177 38
by 0 177 38
Barros, 0 177 38
dismissing 0 177 38
the 0 177 38
protesters 0 177 38
as 0 177 38
“lefties” 1 177 38
and 0 177 38
hugging 0 177 38

publicly 0 177 38
during 0 177 38

"I 0 177 39
can't 0 177 39
condemn 0 177 39
[Barros] 0 177 39
because 0 177 39
I 0 177 39
don't 0 177 39
have 0 177 39
evidence," 0 177 39
he 0 177 39
said 0 177 39
on 0 177 39
the 0 177 39
plane 0 177 39
back 0 177 39
to 0 177 39
Rome, 0 177 39
suggesting 0 177 39
he 0 177 39
had 0 177 39
ignored 0 177 39
or 0 177 39
never 0 177 39
read 0 177 39
the 0 177 39
letter 0 177 39
from 0 177 39
Cruz. 0 177 39

That 0 177 40
was 0 177 40
too 0 177 40
much 0 177 40
for 0 177 40
O’Malley, 0 177 40
who 0 177 40
said 0 177 40
Francis 0 177 40
had 1 177 40
caused 1 177 40
"great 1 177 40
pain” 1 177 40
to 1 177 40
victims. 1 177 40

If 1 177 41
Francis 1 177 41
was 1 177 41
not 1 177 41
listening 1 177 41
to 1 177 41
the 1 177 41
commission 1 177 41
about 1 177 41
Barros, 1 177 41
whom 1 177 41
was 1 177 41
he 1 177 41
listening 1 177 41
to? 1 177 41

Vatican 0 177 42
watchers 0 177 42
believe 0 177 42
the 0 177 42
pope 0 177 42
was 0 177 42
influenced 0 177 42
by 0 177 42
Chilean 0 177 42
Cardinal 0 177 42
Francisco 0 177 42
Javier 0 177 42
Errazuriz, 0 177 42
a 0 177 42
member 0 177 42
of 0 177 42
the 0 177 42
G9 0 177 42
group 0 177 42
who 0 177 42
has 0 177 42
backed 0 177 42
Barros 0 177 42
and 0 177 42
reportedly 0 177 42
helped 0 177 42
block 0 177 42
moves 0 177 42
to 0 177 42
make 0 177 42
Cruz 0 177 42
a 0 177 42
member 0 177 42
of 0 177 42
the 0 177 42
abuse 0 177 42
commission. 0 177 42

So 0 177 43
is 0 177 43
the 0 177 43
pope 0 177 43
intransigent 0 177 43
on 0 177 43
Barros? 0 177 43

No. 0 177 44

Something 0 177 45
changed 0 177 45
his 0 177 45
mind 0 177 45
after 0 177 45
his 0 177 45
Chilean 0 177 45
trip, 0 177 45
possibly 0 177 45
the 0 177 45
scale 0 177 45
of 0 177 45
the 0 177 45
protest 0 177 45
against 0 177 45
Barros 0 177 45
in 0 177 45

who 0 177 46
now 0 177 46
lives 0 177 46
in 0 177 46
Philadelphia. 0 177 46

"For 0 177 47
the 0 177 47
first 0 177 47
time 0 177 47
I 0 177 47
felt 0 177 47
that 0 177 47
someone 0 177 47
is 0 177 47
listening," 0 177 47
Cruz 0 177 47
said 0 177 47
after 0 177 47
the 0 177 47
meeting. 0 177 47

What 0 177 48
happens 0 177 48
next? 0 177 48

“This 0 177 49
should 0 177 49
lead 0 177 49
to 0 177 49
Barros 0 177 49
stepping 0 177 49
down,” 0 177 49
said 0 177 49
Saunders, 0 177 49
