"Muslim 1
Invaders" 1

Hungarian 0
Prime 0
Minister 0
Viktor 0
Orban 0
doesn't 0
mince 0
words 0
when 0
it 0
comes 0
to 0
the 0
Muslim 1
invasion 1
in 0
Europe 0
and 0
specifically 0
to 0
his 0
own 0
country. 0

Orban 0
says 0
there 0
is 0
not 0
only 0
Muslim 1
invaders 1
in 0
the 0
mix 0
of 0
"refugees," 0
but 0
also 0
“economic 0
migrants" 0
seeking 0
better 0
lives 0
for 0
themselves. 0

Indeed, 0
both 0
of 0
these 0
are 0
true. 0

There 0
are 0
plenty 0
of 0
these 0
people 0
who 0
are 0
simply 0
happy 0
to 0
have 0
a 0
place 0
to 0
live 0
after 0
many 0
were 0
driven 0
from 0
their 0
homes 0
due 0
to 0
the 0
US, 0
Russia 0
and 0
other 0
countries 0
putting 1
their 1
noses 1
where 0
they 0
didn't 0
belong 0
and 0
funding, 0
training 0
and 0
arming 0
Islamic 0
jihadis 0
there. 0

Then, 0
there 0
are 0
those 0
who 0
clearly 0
come 0
to 0
the 0
country 0
to 0
Islamasize 0
the 0
country 0
because 0
they 0
have 0
an 1
Islamic 1
dominionist 1
attitude 1
borne 0
of 0
the 0
teachings 0
of 0
the 0
Koran 0
and 0
Muhammad 0
. 0

RT 0
reports: 0

Refugees 0
in 0
Europe 0
are 0
just 0
“Muslim 1
invaders” 1
and 0
economic 0
migrants 0
seeking 0
better 0
lives, 0
Hungarian 0
PM 0
Viktor 0
Orban 0
has 0
said, 0
adding 0
that 0
the 0
large 0
number 0
of 0
Muslims 0
in 0
the 0
EU 0
had 0
led 0
to 0
the 0
appearance 0
of 0
‘parallel 0
societies.’ 0
Asked 0
in 0
an 0
interview 0
with 0
the 0
German 0
Bild 0
newspaper 0
why 0
Budapest 0
does 0
not 0
want 0
to 0
accept 0
any 0
refugees, 0
Orban 0
replied: 0
“We 0
don’t 0
consider 0
these 0
people 0
to 0
be 0
Muslim 0
refugees.” 0
Instead, 0
the 0
tough-talking 0
politician 0
said 0
they 0
were 0
regarded 0
as 0
“Muslim 1
invaders.” 1
Asylum 0
seekers 0
must 0
cross 0
four 0
countries 0
to 0
reach 0
Hungary 0
from 0
Syria, 0
all 0
of 0
which 0
are 0
not 0
as 0
rich 0
as 0
Germany 0
but 0
are 0
economically 0
stable, 0
the 0
PM 0
said. 0

He 0
was 0
apparently 0
referring 0
to 0
Turkey, 0
Greece, 0
Macedonia 0
and 0
Serbia 0
– 0
a 0
common 0
route 0
for 0
migrants 0
heading 0
for 0
‘wealthy’ 0
Europe. 0

“So, 0
they 0
are 0
not 0
running 0
for 0
their 0
lives 0
[in 0
these 0
countries]. 0

They 0
are 0
merely 0
economic 0
migrants 0
seeking 0
a 0
better 0
life,” 0
Orban 0
concluded. 0

He 0
stressed 0
though, 0
that 0
he 0
can 0
only 0
speak 0
for 0
the 0
Hungarians 0
and 0
they 1
“don’t 1
want” 1
immigration. 1

In 0
his 0
view, 0
the 0
government 0
simply 0
can’t 0
go 0
against 0
the 0
will 0
of 0
the 0
people. 0

And 0
Orban 0
has 0
stayed 0
the 0
course, 0
too 0
while 0
governments 0
like 0
that 0
of 0
Germany 0
have 0
ignored 0
their 0
people 0
to 0
allow 0
for 0
a 0
clear 0
invasion 0
of 0
Germany 0
that 0
has 0
led 0
to 0
untold 1
numbers 1
of 0
sexual 1
assaults 1
by 1
Muslim 1
migrants, 1
attacks 1
on 1
Christians 1
and 1
there's 1
no 1
telling 1
the 1
amount 1
of 1
damage 1
to 1
the 1
unethical 1
welfare 1
system 1
in 1
the 1
country. 1

RT 0
continues: 0

Going 0
further, 0
the 0
prime 0
minister 0
noted 0
that 0
no 0
refugee 0
wants 0
to 0
go 0
to 0
Portugal, 0
for 0
example, 0
adding 0
that 0
the 0
majority 0
of 0
asylum 0
seekers 0
simply 0
wanted 0
to 0
live 0
in 0
prosperous 0
Germany. 0

“The 1
reason 1
why 1
people 1
are 1
in 1
your 1
country 1
is 1
not 1
because 1
they 1
are 1
refugees, 1
but 1
because 1
they 1
want 1
a 1
German 1
life,” 1
he 0
said, 0
describing 0
the 0
issue 0
“politically” 0
as 0
a 0
European 0
problem 0
but, 0
“sociologically,” 0
as 0
a 0
German 0
problem. 0

Orban 0
specifically 0
targeted 0
Germany 0
and 0
Chancellor 0
Angela 0
Merkel’s 0
‘open-door’ 0
policy 0
towards 0
asylum 0
seekers. 0

“I’ve 0
never 0
understood 0
how 0
chaos, 1
anarchy 1
and 1
illegal 1
border 1
crossings 1
are 0
viewed 0
as 0
something 0
good 0
in 0
a 0
country 0
like 0
Germany, 0
which 0
we 0
view 0
as 0
the 1
best 1
example 1
of 1
discipline 1
and 1
the 1
rule 1
of 1
law,” 1
he 0
said. 0

The 0
recent 0
wave 0
of 0
refugees 0
reaching 0
Europe 0
is 0
merely 0
an 0
invasion, 1
according 0
to 0
Orban. 0

“If 0
someone 0
wants 0
to 0
come 0
to 0
your 0
house, 0
he 0
knocks 0
on 0
your 0
door 0
and 0
asks: 0
‘Can 0
we 0
come 0
in, 0
can 0
we 0
stay?’ 0
They 0
[asylum 0
seekers] 0
didn’t 0
do 0
that, 0
they 0
crossed 0
the 0
border 0
illegally,” 0
he 0
stated. 0

Orban 0
then 0
did 0
what 0
most 0
political 0
representatives 0
will 0
simply 0
not 0
do, 0
he 0
told 0
the 0
truth 0
about 0
multiculturalism. 0

He 0
called 0
it 0
an 0
"illusion" 0
and 0
said 0
that 0
Christian 1
and 1
Muslim 1
societies 1
“will 1
never 1
unite.” 1

Of 0
course, 0
they 0
won't. 0

They 1
have 1
absolutely 1
nothing 1
in 1
common. 1

They 1
cannot 1
agree 1
on 1
God's 1
law, 1
which 1
most 1
Western 1
societies 1
were 1
base 1
on, 1
including 1
the 1
united 1
States. 1

They 1
cannot 1
agree 1
on 0
the 0
Scriptures. 0

They 1
cannot 1
agree 1
on 1
the 0
person 0
and 0
work 0
of 0
Jesus 0
the 0
Christ. 0

They 0
can't 0
even 0
agree 0
on 0
the 0
means 0
of 0
proselytizing 0
and 0
of 0
what 0
real 0
spiritual 0
weapons 0
are. 0

PM 0
Orban 0
has 0
remained 0
consistent. 0

He 0
has 0
publicly 0
told 0
the 0
Muslim 1
invaders 1
to 0
leave 1
Hungary 1
and 1
never 1
come 1
back. 1

He 0
has 0
rebuffed 0
Brussels, 0
which 0
is 0
largely 0
Islamic, 0
and 0
told 0
them 0
that 0
Hungary 1
would 1
defend 1
its 1
borders, 1
and 1
it 1
has. 1

Orban's 0
border 0
wall 0
reduced 0
illegal 0
immigration 0
by 0
99%! 0

He 1
has 1
genuinely 1
reached 1
out 1
his 1
hand 1
to 1
help 1
Christian 1
migrants 1
instead 1
of 1
Muslim 1
migrants 1
and 1
he 1
seems 1
to 1
be 1
one 1
that 1
holds 1
to 1
the 1
Christian 1
faith, 1
as 1
emulated 1
by 1
the 1
Protestant 1
Reformers, 1
saying, 1
"That 1
which 1
serves 1
the 1
glory 1
of 1
God 1
is 1
the 1
best 1
for 1
the 1
people." 1

Furthermore, 0
Orban 0
has 0
also 0
called 0
out 0
the 0
man 1
behind 1
the 1
curtain 1
in 0
a 0
lot 0
of 0
the 0
promoting 0
of 0
this 0
Muslim 1
invasion 1
of 0
the 0
West, 0
George 0
Soros. 0

Anti-jihadist 0
activist 0
Pamela 0
Geller 0
praised 0
Orban 0
for 0
his 0
honesty 0
and 0
wrote, 0
"At 0
last, 0
a 0
politician 0
who 0
speaks 0
the 0
truth 0
about 0
the 0
Muslim 1
invasion 1
of 0
Europe. 0

And 0
while 0
Orban 0
is 0
right 0
that 0
these 0
are 0
'economic 0
migrants,' 0
they 0
are 0
also 0
'Muslim 1
invaders.'" 1

"They 0
don’t 0
want 0
a 0
'German 0
life' 0
in 0
Germany 0
in 0
the 0
sense 0
that 0
they 0
are 0
willing 0
to 0
accept 0
German 0
values," 0
she 0
added. 0

"Many, 1
all 1
too 1
many, 1
of 0
them 1
want 1
to 1
overwhelm 1
German 1
values, 1
and 1
European 1
values 1
in 1
general, 1
with 1
sharia 1
values. 1

They 1
are 1
in 1
Europe 1
to 1
conquer 1
and 1
Islamize 1
it, 1
with 1
willing 1
and 1
eager 1
help 1
from 1
Europe’s 1
short-sighted, 1
self-serving, 1
internationalist 1
intelligentsia." 1

Indeed! 1

Thank 1
you 1
Prime 1
Minister 1
Orban 1
for 1
saying 1
what 1
needed 1
to 1
be 1
said! 1
