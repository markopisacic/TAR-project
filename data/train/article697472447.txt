at 0 28 1
the 0 28 1
Mandalay 0 28 1

Jesus 0 28 2
Campos, 0 28 2
who 0 28 2
the 0 28 2
narrative 0 28 2
is 0 28 2
constantly 0 28 2
changing 0 28 2

is 0 28 2
still 0 28 2
a 0 28 2
source 0 28 2
of 0 28 2
mystery. 0 28 2

So 0 28 3
who 0 28 3
is 0 28 3
Jesus 0 28 3
Campos? 0 28 3

That 0 28 4
burning 0 28 4
question 0 28 4
has 0 28 4
bothered 0 28 4
many 0 28 4
since 0 28 4
the 0 28 4
release 0 28 4
of 0 28 4
his 0 28 4
name, 0 28 4
but 0 28 4
there’s 0 28 4
been 0 28 4
no 0 28 4
photograph 0 28 4
of 0 28 4
this 0 28 4
alleged 0 28 4
hero, 0 28 4
even 0 28 4
though 0 28 4
we’ve 0 28 4
already 0 28 4
seen 0 28 4
crime 0 28 4
scene 0 28 4
images 0 28 4
of 0 28 4
the 0 28 4
guns 0 28 4
Stephen 0 28 4

up 0 28 4
to 0 28 4
his 0 28 4
32nd-floor 0 28 4
hotel 0 28 4

The 0 28 5
ever-changing 0 28 5
narrative 0 28 5
now 0 28 5
though, 0 28 5
seems 0 28 5
to 0 28 5
swirl 0 28 5
around 0 28 5
this 0 28 5
unknown 0 28 5
mystery 0 28 5
security 0 28 5
guard. 0 28 5

At 0 28 6
first, 0 28 6
Campos, 0 28 6
a 0 28 6
guard 0 28 6
at 0 28 6
the 0 28 6
Mandalay 0 28 6
Bay 0 28 6
Resort 0 28 6
and 0 28 6
Casino, 0 28 6
was 0 28 6
hailed 0 28 6
a 0 28 6
hero 0 28 6
for 0 28 6
helping 0 28 6
guide 0 28 6
police 0 28 6
to 0 28 6
gunman 0 28 6
Stephen 0 28 6
Paddock’s 0 28 6
room 0 28 6
on 0 28 6
the 0 28 6
32nd 0 28 6
floor. 0 28 6

Police 0 28 7
said 0 28 7
Campos 0 28 7
was 0 28 7
shot 0 28 7
in 0 28 7
the 0 28 7
leg 0 28 7
at 0 28 7
the 0 28 7
end 0 28 7
of 0 28 7
Paddock’s 0 28 7
assault 0 28 7
on 0 28 7
concertgoers—potentially 0 28 7
distracting 0 28 7
the 0 28 7
gunman 0 28 7
and 0 28 7
causing 0 28 7
him 0 28 7
to 0 28 7
panic 0 28 7
and 0 28 7
kill 0 28 7
himself. 0 28 7

But 0 28 8
now, 0 28 8
questions 0 28 8
have 0 28 8
been 0 28 8
raised 0 28 8
after 0 28 8
Clark 0 28 8
County 0 28 8
Sheriff 0 28 8
Joe 0 28 8
Lombardo 0 28 8
revised 0 28 8
the 0 28 8
timeline 0 28 8
and 0 28 8
said 0 28 8
Campos 0 28 8
had 0 28 8
actually 0 28 8
been 0 28 8
shot 0 28 8
about 0 28 8
9:59 0 28 8
p.m. 0 28 8
a 0 28 8
(full 0 28 8
six 0 28 8
minutes 0 28 8
before 0 28 8
the 0 28 8
mass 0 28 8
shooting 0 28 8
began 0 28 8
at 0 28 8
10:05 0 28 8
p.m.) 0 28 8
which 0 28 8
means 0 28 8
the 0 28 8
guard 0 28 8
could 0 28 8
have 0 28 8
instead 0 28 8
led 0 28 8
Paddock 0 28 8
to 0 28 8
start 0 28 8
opening 0 28 8
fire 0 28 8
on 0 28 8
the 0 28 8
crowd 0 28 8
for 0 28 8
fear 0 28 8
of 0 28 8
being 0 28 8
caught. 0 28 8

Police 0 28 9
have 0 28 9
said 0 28 9
it 0 28 9
was 0 28 9
difficult 0 28 9
to 0 28 9
identify 0 28 9
the 0 28 9
source 0 28 9
of 0 28 9
the 0 28 9
bullets 0 28 9
during 0 28 9
the 0 28 9
attack, 0 28 9
and 0 28 9
the 0 28 9
confusion 0 28 9
added 0 28 9
more 0 28 9
minutes 0 28 9
to 0 28 9
their 0 28 9
lengthy 0 28 9
response. 0 28 9

But 0 28 10
the 0 28 10
revised 0 28 10
timeline 0 28 10
shows 0 28 10
officers 0 28 10
would 0 28 10
have 0 28 10
known 0 28 10
where 0 28 10
Paddock 0 28 10
was 0 28 10
before 0 28 10
the 0 28 10
mass 0 28 10
shooting 0 28 10
even 0 28 10
started. 0 28 10

Did 0 28 11
Campos 0 28 11
call 0 28 11
911? 0 28 11

What 0 28 12
happened 0 28 12
during 0 28 12
those 0 28 12
six 0 28 12
minutes? 0 28 12

Much 0 28 13
of 0 28 13
Campos’s 0 28 13
story 0 28 13
and 0 28 13
background 0 28 13
remains 0 28 13
a 0 28 13
mystery. 0 28 13

–Newsweek 0 28 14

Campos’s 0 28 15
co-worker 0 28 15
Liliana 0 28 15
Rodriguez 0 28 15
started 0 28 15
a 0 28 15
GoFundMe 0 28 15
account 0 28 15
for 0 28 15
him 0 28 15
on 0 28 15
October 0 28 15
3, 0 28 15
explaining 0 28 15
that 0 28 15
he’d 0 28 15
been 0 28 15
shot 0 28 15
while 0 28 15
on 0 28 15
“random 0 28 15
patrol” 0 28 15
and 0 28 15
it 0 28 15
could 0 28 15
have 0 28 15
been 0 28 15
anyone 0 28 15
of 0 28 15
us. 0 28 15

“Funds 0 28 16
will 0 28 16
be 0 28 16
used 0 28 16
to 0 28 16
provide 0 28 16
relief 0 28 16
and 0 28 16
financial 0 28 16
support 0 28 16
for 0 28 16
him 0 28 16
while 0 28 16
he 0 28 16
gets 0 28 16
back 0 28 16
on 0 28 16
his 0 28 16
feet,” 0 28 16
Rodriguez’s 0 28 16
online 0 28 16
petition 0 28 16
says. 0 28 16

“This 0 28 17
is 0 28 17
a 0 28 17
young 0 28 17
man 0 28 17
that 0 28 17
I 0 28 17
work 0 28 17
with 0 28 17
day 0 28 17
in 0 28 17

day 0 28 17
out. 0 28 17

Any 0 28 18
financial 0 28 18
support 0 28 18
would 0 28 18
be 0 28 18
appreciated 0 28 18
for 0 28 18
the 0 28 18
time 0 28 18
he 0 28 18
would 0 28 18
need 0 28 18
to 0 28 18
recover.” 0 28 18

Strangely, 0 28 19
a 0 28 19
picture 0 28 19
of 0 28 19
Campos 0 28 19
wasn’t 0 28 19
displayed 0 28 19
as 0 28 19
part 0 28 19
of 0 28 19
the 0 28 19
fund 0 28 19
because 0 28 19
Rodriguez 0 28 19
indicated 0 28 19
that 0 28 19
“due 0 28 19
to 0 28 19
privacy 0 28 19
from 0 28 19
the 0 28 19

we 0 28 19
do 0 28 19
not 0 28 19
feel 0 28 19
comfortable 0 28 19
publishing 0 28 19
a 0 28 19
photo.” 0 28 19

There 1 28 20
are 1 28 20
obviously 1 28 20
certain 1 28 20
things 1 28 20
that 1 28 20
the 1 28 20
FBI 1 28 20
and 1 28 20
other 1 28 20
investigators 1 28 20
seem 1 28 20
intent 1 28 20
on 1 28 20
covering 1 28 20
up. 1 28 20

Their 0 28 21
own 0 28 21
narrative 0 28 21
is 0 28 21
quickly 0 28 21
shattering. 0 28 21

about 0 28 22

the 0 28 22

in 0 28 22
some 0 28 22
of 0 28 22
what 0 28 22

it 0 28 22
only 0 28 22
added 0 28 22
more 0 28 22

in 0 28 22

McMahill 0 28 23
told 0 28 23
KNPR, 0 28 23
a 0 28 23
local 0 28 23
NPR 0 28 23
affiliate, 0 28 23
that 0 28 23
Campos 0 28 23
went 0 28 23
up 0 28 23
to 0 28 23
the 0 28 23
32nd 0 28 23
floor 0 28 23
to 0 28 23
investigate 0 28 23
a 0 28 23
door 0 28 23
alarm. 0 28 23

While 0 28 24
on 0 28 24
the 0 28 24
32nd 0 28 24
floor, 0 28 24
he 0 28 24
found 0 28 24
that 0 28 24
a 0 28 24
stairwell 0 28 24
door 0 28 24
was 0 28 24
jammed 0 28 24
and 0 28 24
radioed 0 28 24
down 0 28 24
to 0 28 24
maintenance. 0 28 24

Campos 0 28 25
heard 0 28 25
a 0 28 25
drilling 0 28 25
sound 0 28 25
and 0 28 25
thought 0 28 25
it 0 28 25
was 0 28 25
odd. 0 28 25

A 0 28 26
maintenance 0 28 26
worker 0 28 26
came 0 28 26
up 0 28 26
to 0 28 26
the 0 28 26
32nd 0 28 26
floor. 0 28 26

As 0 28 27
the 0 28 27
pair 0 28 27
started 0 28 27
talking, 0 28 27
Paddock 0 28 27
began 0 28 27
firing 0 28 27
through 0 28 27
the 0 28 27
door 0 28 27
of 0 28 27
his 0 28 27
room, 0 28 27
first 0 28 27
with 0 28 27
a 0 28 27
single-fire 0 28 27
gun 0 28 27
and 0 28 27
then 0 28 27
with 0 28 27
a 0 28 27
rapid-fire 0 28 27
rifle. 0 28 27

Police 0 28 28
have 0 28 28
said 0 28 28
that 0 28 28
when 0 28 28
Campos 0 28 28
radioed 0 28 28
what 0 28 28
happened, 0 28 28
it 0 28 28
helped 0 28 28
them 0 28 28
track 0 28 28
where 0 28 28
Paddock 0 28 28
was 0 28 28
holed 0 28 28
up 0 28 28
– 0 28 28
so 1 28 28
why 1 28 28
change 1 28 28
the 1 28 28
narrative 1 28 28
to 1 28 28
make 1 28 28
it 1 28 28
even 1 28 28
more 1 28 28
unbelievable? 1 28 28

And 0 28 29
still, 0 28 29
none 0 28 29
of 0 28 29
this 0 28 29
explains 0 28 29
why 0 28 29
Campos 0 28 29
is 0 28 29
not 0 28 29
registered 0 28 29
as 0 28 29
a 0 28 29
security 0 28 29
guard 0 28 29
either, 0 28 29
and 0 28 29
why 0 28 29
the 0 28 29
timeline 0 28 29
is 0 28 29
being 0 28 29
changed 0 28 29

What 1 28 30
exactly 1 28 30
do 1 28 30
they 1 28 30
want 1 28 30
