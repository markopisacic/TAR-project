other 0 58 9
private 0 58 9
entreaty 0 58 9
concerning 0 58 9

a 1 58 9
withering 1 58 9
indictment 1 58 9
of 1 58 9
a 1 58 9
papacy 1 58 9

rebuke 0 58 10

for 0 58 10
his 0 58 10
recklessness, 0 58 10
his 0 58 10
deliberate 0 58 10
ambiguity, 0 58 10
his 0 58 10
fomenting 0 58 10
of 0 58 10
error, 0 58 10
his 0 58 10
sowing 0 58 10
of 0 58 10

his 0 58 10
unheard-of 0 58 10
calumnies 0 58 10
of 0 58 10
the 0 58 10

and 0 58 10
even 0 58 10
his 0 58 10
reduction 0 58 10
of 0 58 10
the 0 58 10
faith 0 58 10
to 0 58 10
an 0 58 10
ideology—precisely 0 58 10
the 0 58 10
wrong 0 58 10
of 0 58 10
which 0 58 10
he 0 58 10

Catholics: 0 58 10

Your 0 58 11
Holiness, 0 58 11
a 1 58 11
chronic 1 58 11
confusion 1 58 11
seems 1 58 11
to 1 58 11
mark 1 58 11
your 1 58 11
pontificate…. 1 58 11

This 0 58 12
fosters 0 58 12
within 0 58 12
the 0 58 12
faithful 0 58 12
a 0 58 12
growing 0 58 12
unease 0 58 12

…. 0 58 13
In 0 58 13
"Amoris 0 58 13
Laetitia," 0 58 13
your 0 58 13
guidance 0 58 13
at 0 58 13
times 0 58 13
seems 0 58 13
intentionally 0 58 13
ambiguous, 0 58 13
thus 0 58 13
inviting 0 58 13
both 0 58 13
a 0 58 13
traditional 0 58 13
interpretation 0 58 13
of 0 58 13
Catholic 0 58 13
teaching 0 58 13
on 0 58 13
marriage 0 58 13
and 0 58 13
divorce 0 58 13
as 0 58 13
well 0 58 13
as 0 58 13
one 0 58 13
that 0 58 13
might 0 58 13
imply 0 58 13
a 0 58 13
change 0 58 13
in 0 58 13
that 0 58 13
teaching…. 0 58 13

To 1 58 14
teach 1 58 14
with 1 58 14
such 1 58 14
a 1 58 14
seemingly 1 58 14
intentional 1 58 14
lack 1 58 14
of 1 58 14
clarity 1 58 14
inevitably 1 58 14
risks 1 58 14
sinning 1 58 14
against 1 58 14
the 1 58 14
Holy 1 58 14
Spirit, 1 58 14
the 1 58 14
Spirit 1 58 14
of 1 58 14
truth. 1 58 14

The 0 58 15
Holy 0 58 15
Spirit 0 58 15
is 0 58 15
given 0 58 15
to 0 58 15
the 0 58 15
Church, 0 58 15
and 0 58 15
particularly 0 58 15
to 0 58 15
yourself, 0 58 15
to 0 58 15
dispel 0 58 15
error, 0 58 15
not 0 58 15
to 0 58 15
foster 0 58 15
it. 0 58 15

[Y]ou 0 58 16
seem 0 58 16
to 0 58 16
censor 0 58 16
and 0 58 16
even 0 58 16
mock 0 58 16
those 0 58 16
who 0 58 16
interpret 0 58 16
Chapter 0 58 16
8 0 58 16
of 0 58 16
"Amoris 0 58 16
Laetitia" 0 58 16
in 0 58 16
accord 0 58 16
with 0 58 16
Church 0 58 16
tradition 0 58 16
as 0 58 16
Pharisaic 1 58 16
stone-throwers 1 58 16
who 1 58 16
embody 1 58 16
a 1 58 16
merciless 1 58 16
rigorism. 1 58 16

This 0 58 17
kind 0 58 17
of 0 58 17
calumny 0 58 17
is 0 58 17
alien 0 58 17
to 0 58 17
the 0 58 17
nature 0 58 17
of 0 58 17
the 0 58 17
Petrine 0 58 17
ministry…. 0 58 17

Such 0 58 18
behavior 0 58 18
gives 0 58 18
the 0 58 18
impression 0 58 18
that 0 58 18
your 0 58 18
views 0 58 18
cannotsurvive 0 58 18
theological 0 58 18
scrutiny, 0 58 18
and 0 58 18
so 0 58 18
must 0 58 18
be 0 58 18
sustained 0 58 18
by 0 58 18
“ad 0 58 18
hominem” 0 58 18
arguments. 0 58 18

[T]oo 0 58 19
often 0 58 19
your 0 58 19
manner 0 58 19
seems 0 58 19
to 0 58 19
demean 0 58 19
the 0 58 19
importance 0 58 19
of 0 58 19
Church 0 58 19
doctrine. 0 58 19

Again 0 58 20
and 0 58 20
again 0 58 20
you 0 58 20
portray 0 58 20
doctrine 0 58 20
as 0 58 20
dead 0 58 20
and 0 58 20
bookish, 0 58 20
and 0 58 20
far 0 58 20
from 0 58 20
the 0 58 20
pastoral 0 58 20
concerns 0 58 20
of 0 58 20
everyday 0 58 20
life. 0 58 20

Your 0 58 21
critics 0 58 21
have 0 58 21
been 0 58 21
accused, 0 58 21
in 0 58 21
your 0 58 21
own 0 58 21
words, 0 58 21
of 0 58 21
making 0 58 21
doctrine 0 58 21
an 0 58 21
ideology. 0 58 21

But 0 58 22
it 0 58 22
is 0 58 22
precisely 0 58 22
Christian 0 58 22
doctrine… 0 58 22
that 0 58 22
frees 0 58 22
people 0 58 22
from 0 58 22
worldly 0 58 22
ideologies 0 58 22
and 0 58 22
assures 0 58 22
that 0 58 22
they 0 58 22
are 0 58 22
actually 0 58 22
preaching 0 58 22
and 0 58 22
teaching 0 58 22
the 0 58 22
authentic, 0 58 22
life-giving 0 58 22
Gospel. 0 58 22

Those 0 58 23
who 0 58 23
devalue 0 58 23
the 0 58 23
doctrines 0 58 23
of 0 58 23
the 0 58 23
Church 0 58 23
[i.e., 0 58 23
Francis!] 0 58 23

separate 0 58 24
themselves 0 58 24
from 0 58 24
Jesus, 0 58 24
the 0 58 24
author 0 58 24
of 0 58 24
truth… 0 58 24
What 0 58 24
they 0 58 24
[i.e., 0 58 24
Francis] 0 58 24
then 0 58 24
possess, 0 58 24
and 0 58 24
can 0 58 24
only 0 58 24
possess, 0 58 24
is 0 58 24
an 0 58 24
ideology 0 58 24
– 0 58 24
one 0 58 24
that 0 58 24
conforms 0 58 24
to 0 58 24
the 0 58 24
world 0 58 24
of 0 58 24
sin 0 58 24
and 0 58 24
death. 0 58 24

[F]aithful 0 58 25
Catholics 0 58 25
can 0 58 25
only 0 58 25
be 0 58 25
disconcerted 0 58 25
by 0 58 25
your 0 58 25
choice 0 58 25
of 0 58 25
some 0 58 25
bishops, 0 58 25
men 0 58 25
who 0 58 25
seem 0 58 25
not 0 58 25
merely 0 58 25
open 0 58 25
to 0 58 25
those 0 58 25
who 0 58 25
hold 0 58 25
views 0 58 25
counter 0 58 25
to 0 58 25
Christian 0 58 25
belief 0 58 25
but 0 58 25
who 0 58 25
support 0 58 25
and 0 58 25
even 0 58 25
defend 0 58 25
them. 0 58 25

What 0 58 26
scandalizes 0 58 26
believers, 0 58 26
and 0 58 26
even 0 58 26
some 0 58 26
fellow 0 58 26
bishops, 0 58 26
is 0 58 26
not 0 58 26
only 0 58 26
your 0 58 26
having 0 58 26
appointed 0 58 26
such 0 58 26
men 0 58 26
to 0 58 26
be 0 58 26
shepherds 0 58 26
of 0 58 26
the 0 58 26
Church, 0 58 26
but 0 58 26
that 0 58 26
you 0 58 26
also 0 58 26
seem 0 58 26
silent 0 58 26
in 0 58 26
the 0 58 26
face 0 58 26
of 0 58 26
their 0 58 26
teaching 0 58 26
and 0 58 26
pastoral 0 58 26
practice…. 0 58 26

As 0 58 27
a 0 58 27
result, 0 58 27
many 0 58 27
of 0 58 27
the 0 58 27
faithful, 0 58 27
who 0 58 27
embody 0 58 27
the 0 58 27
"sensus 0 58 27
fidelium," 0 58 27
are 0 58 27
losing 0 58 27
confidence 0 58 27
in 0 58 27
their 0 58 27
supreme 0 58 27
shepherd. 0 58 27

[T]he 0 58 28
Church 0 58 28
is 0 58 28
one 0 58 28
body, 0 58 28
the 0 58 28
Mystical 0 58 28
Body 0 58 28
of 0 58 28
Christ, 0 58 28
and 0 58 28
you 0 58 28
are 0 58 28
commissioned 0 58 28
by 0 58 28
the 0 58 28
Lord 0 58 28
himself 0 58 28
to 0 58 28
promote 0 58 28
and 0 58 28
strengthen 0 58 28
her 0 58 28
unity. 0 58 28

But 0 58 29
your 0 58 29
actions 0 58 29
and 0 58 29
words 0 58 29
too 0 58 29
often 0 58 29
seem 0 58 29
intent 0 58 29
on 0 58 29
doing 0 58 29
the 0 58 29
opposite…. 0 58 29

You 0 58 30
have 0 58 30
often 0 58 30
spoken 0 58 30
about 0 58 30
the 0 58 30
need 0 58 30
for 0 58 30
transparency 0 58 30
within 0 58 30
the 0 58 30
Church. 0 58 30

You 0 58 31
have 0 58 31
frequently 0 58 31
encouraged… 0 58 31
all 0 58 31
persons, 0 58 31
especially 0 58 31
bishops, 0 58 31
to 0 58 31
speak 0 58 31
their 0 58 31
mind 0 58 31
and 0 58 31
not 0 58 31
be 0 58 31
fearful 0 58 31
of 0 58 31
what 0 58 31
the 0 58 31
pope 0 58 31
may 0 58 31
think. 0 58 31

But… 0 58 32
what 0 58 32
many 0 58 32
[bishops] 0 58 32
have 0 58 32
learned 0 58 32
from 0 58 32
your 0 58 32
pontificate 0 58 32
is 0 58 32
not 0 58 32
that 0 58 32
you 0 58 32
are 0 58 32
open 0 58 32
to 0 58 32
criticism, 0 58 32
but 0 58 32
that 0 58 32
you 0 58 32
resent 0 58 32
it… 0 58 32
Many 0 58 32
fear 0 58 32
that 0 58 32
if 0 58 32
they 0 58 32
speak 0 58 32
their 0 58 32
mind, 0 58 32
they 0 58 32
will 0 58 32
be 0 58 32
marginalized 0 58 32
or 0 58 32
worse. 0 58 32

I 0 58 33
have 0 58 33
often 0 58 33
asked 0 58 33
myself: 0 58 33
"Why 0 58 33
has 0 58 33
Jesus 0 58 33
let 0 58 33
all 0 58 33
of 0 58 33
this 0 58 33
happen?" 0 58 33

The 1 58 34
only 1 58 34
answer 1 58 34
that 1 58 34
comes 1 58 34
to 1 58 34
mind 1 58 34
is 1 58 34
that 1 58 34
Jesus 1 58 34
wants 1 58 34
to 1 58 34
manifest 1 58 34
just 1 58 34
how 1 58 34
weak 1 58 34
is 1 58 34
the 1 58 34
faith 1 58 34
of 1 58 34
many 1 58 34
within 1 58 34
the 1 58 34
Church, 1 58 34
even 1 58 34
among 1 58 34
too 1 58 34
many 1 58 34
of 1 58 34
her 1 58 34
bishops. 1 58 34

Ironically, 1 58 35
your 1 58 35
pontificate 1 58 35
has 1 58 35
given 1 58 35
those 1 58 35
who 1 58 35
hold 1 58 35
harmful 1 58 35
theological 1 58 35
and 1 58 35
pastoral 1 58 35
views 1 58 35
the 1 58 35
license 1 58 35
and 1 58 35
confidence 1 58 35
to 1 58 35
come 1 58 35
into 1 58 35
the 1 58 35
light 1 58 35
and 1 58 35
expose 1 58 35

Father 0 58 36
Weinandy 0 58 36
reveals 0 58 36
that 0 58 36
he 0 58 36
decided 0 58 36
to 0 58 36
publicize 0 58 36
this 0 58 36
historic 0 58 36
missive 0 58 36
only 0 58 36
after 0 58 36
receiving 0 58 36
an 0 58 36
unmistakable 0 58 36
sign 0 58 36
from 0 58 36
heaven. 0 58 36

As 0 58 37
he 0 58 37
recounts 0 58 37
here, 0 58 37
after 0 58 37
repeatedly 0 58 37
“beseeching 0 58 37
Jesus 0 58 37
and 0 58 37
Mary, 0 58 37
St. 0 58 37
Peter 0 58 37
and 0 58 37
all 0 58 37
of 0 58 37
the 0 58 37
saintly 0 58 37
popes 0 58 37
who 0 58 37
are 0 58 37
buried 0 58 37
there 0 58 37
to 0 58 37
do 0 58 37
something 0 58 37
to 0 58 37
rectify 0 58 37
the 0 58 37
confusion 0 58 37
and 0 58 37
turmoil 0 58 37
within 0 58 37
the 0 58 37
Church 0 58 37
today, 0 58 37
a 0 58 37
chaos 0 58 37
and 0 58 37
an 0 58 37
uncertainty 0 58 37
that 0 58 37
I 0 58 37
felt 0 58 37
Pope 0 58 37
Francis 0 58 37
had 0 58 37
himself 0 58 37
caused,” 0 58 37
he 0 58 37
asked 0 58 37
for 0 58 37
a 0 58 37
minutely 0 58 37
specific 0 58 37
sign 0 58 37
from 0 58 37
heaven 0 58 37
on 0 58 37
whether 0 58 37
he 0 58 37
should 0 58 37
write 0 58 37
the 0 58 37
letter: 0 58 37
that 0 58 37
the 0 58 37
next 0 58 37
day 0 58 37
he 0 58 37
would 0 58 37
meet 0 58 37
someone 0 58 37
he 0 58 37
had 0 58 37
not 0 58 37
seen 0 58 37
in 0 58 37
a 0 58 37
very 0 58 37
long 0 58 37
time, 0 58 37
would 0 58 37
never 0 58 37
expect 0 58 37
to 0 58 37
see 0 58 37
in 0 58 37
Rome, 0 58 37
and 0 58 37
was 0 58 37
not 0 58 37
from 0 58 37
the 0 58 37
United 0 58 37
States, 0 58 37
Canada 0 58 37
or 0 58 37
Great 0 58 37
Britain, 0 58 37
which 0 58 37
person 0 58 37
would 0 58 37
utter 0 58 37
the 0 58 37
particular 0 58 37
phrase: 0 58 37
“Keep 0 58 37
up 0 58 37
the 0 58 37
good 0 58 37
writing.” 0 58 37

At 0 58 38
lunch 0 58 38
the 0 58 38
next 0 58 38
day, 0 58 38
the 0 58 38
sign 0 58 38
was 0 58 38
given. 0 58 38

An 0 58 39
old 0 58 39
friend 0 58 39
he 0 58 39
had 0 58 39
not 0 58 39
seen 0 58 39
in 0 58 39
more 0 58 39
than 0 58 39
twenty 0 58 39
years 0 58 39
and 0 58 39
would 0 58 39
never 0 58 39
have 0 58 39
expected 0 58 39
to 0 58 39
meet 0 58 39
in 0 58 39
Rome, 0 58 39
who 0 58 39
is 0 58 39
now 0 58 39
an 0 58 39
archbishop, 0 58 39
appeared 0 58 39
suddenly 0 58 39
from 0 58 39
between 0 58 39
two 0 58 39
parked 0 58 39
cars, 0 58 39
renewed 0 58 39
acquaintances 0 58 39
and, 0 58 39
referring 0 58 39
to 0 58 39
one 0 58 39
of 0 58 39
Father 0 58 39
Weinandy’s 0 58 39
books, 0 58 39
said: 0 58 39
“Keep 0 58 39
up 0 58 39
the 0 58 39
good 0 58 39
writing.” 0 58 39

Writes 0 58 40

Fr. 0 58 41
Weinandy: 0 58 41
“I 0 58 41
could 0 58 41
hardly 0 58 41
believe 0 58 41
that 0 58 41
this 0 58 41
just 0 58 41
happened 0 58 41
in 0 58 41
a 0 58 41
matter 0 58 41
of 0 58 41
a 0 58 41
few 0 58 41
minutes. 0 58 41

But 0 58 42
there 0 58 42
was 0 58 42
no 0 58 42
longer 0 58 42
any 0 58 42
doubt 0 58 42
in 0 58 42
my 0 58 42
mind 0 58 42
that 0 58 42
Jesus 0 58 42
wanted 0 58 42
me 0 58 42
to 0 58 42
write 0 58 42
something. 0 58 42

I 0 58 43
also 0 58 43
think 0 58 43
it 0 58 43
significant 0 58 43
that 0 58 43
it 0 58 43
was 0 58 43
an 0 58 43
Archbishop 0 58 43
that 0 58 43
Jesus 0 58 43
used. 0 58 43

I 0 58 44
considered 0 58 44
it 0 58 44
an 0 58 44
apostolic 0 58 44
mandate.” 0 58 44

Can 0 58 45
we 0 58 45
doubt 0 58 45
that 0 58 45
it 0 58 45
was 0 58 45
indeed 0 58 45
an 0 58 45
apostolic 0 58 45
mandate? 0 58 45

Can 0 58 46
we 0 58 46
not 0 58 46
see 0 58 46
in 0 58 46

Fr. 0 58 47

“In 0 58 54

us 0 58 57

that 0 58 57
the 0 58 57
plan 0 58 57
to 0 58 57
remake 0 58 57

to 0 58 57
the 0 58 57
mind 0 58 57
of 0 58 57

will 0 58 57
ultimately 0 58 57
encounter 0 58 57
a 0 58 57
resistance 0 58 57

will 0 58 57
bring 0 58 57
an 0 58 57
end 0 58 57

Latin 0 58 57
American-style 0 58 57

as 0 58 57
