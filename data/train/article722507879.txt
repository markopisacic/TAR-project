Hill 0
that 0
an 0
FBI 0
mole 0
deeply 0
embedded 0
in 0
the 0
Russian 0
uranium 0
industry 0
had 0
gathered 0

Vadim 0
Mikerin, 0
a 0

–DOJ 0

While 0
the 0
indictment 0
lists 0
Lambert’s 0
company 0
as 0
“Transportation 0
Corporation 0
A,” 0
a 0
simple 0
search 0
reveals 0
that 0
Lambert 0
is 0
the 0
co-President 0
of 0
DAHER-TLI, 0
“the 0
leading 0
front 0
end 0
freight 0
forwarding 0
company 0
dedicated 0
to 0
Nuclear 0
Cargo,” 0
according 0
to 0
its 0
website. 0

In 0
2012, 0
the 0
Nuclear 0
Regulatory 0
Commission 0
sent 0
a 0
letter 0
to 0
Lambert 0
with 0
findings 0
that 0
TLI 0
had 0
exported 0
plutonium 0
“in 0
excess 0
of 0
the 0
maximum 0
quantity 0
and 0
type 0
applied 0
for 0
and 0
licensed,” 0
and 0
“exported 0
Australian 0
obligated 0
material, 0
which 0
was 0
not 0
authorized 0
under 0
license 0
conditions.” 0

Prior 0
to 0
his 0
26 0
year 0
tenure 0
in 0
the 0
transportation 0
industry 0
– 0
20 0
of 0
which 0
have 0
been 0
with 0
TLI, 0
Mr. 0
Lambert 0
was 0
an 0
Arabic 1
Linguist 1
for 1
the 1
Navy 1
for 1
five 1
years, 1
and 0
a 1
Senior 1
Intel 1
Analyst 1
for 1
the 1
Department 1
of 1
Defense 1
(DoD) 1
for 0
three 0
years. 0

Lambert 1
also 1
speaks 1
fluent 1
Arabic 1
and 1
Farsi 1
(Persian), 1
along 1
with 1
French 1
and 1
Italian. 1

The 0
indictment 0
against 0
Lambert 0
corroborates 0
prior 0
reporting 0
by 0
The 0
Hill 0
that 0
an 0
FBI 0
mole 0
buried 0
deep 0
within 0
the 0
Russian 0
nuclear 0
industry 0
had 0
gathered 0
extensive 0
evidence 0
of 0
a 0
scheme 0
involving 0
bribes 0
and 0
kickbacks 0
between 0
Russian 0
nuclear 0
officials 0
and 0
TLI 0
– 0
which 0
would 0
have 0
transported 0
the 0
U.S. 0
uranium 0
sold 0
to 0
Russia 0
in 0
the 0
’20 0
percent’ 0
Uranium 0
One 0
deal. 0

“The 0
Russians 0
were 0
compromising 0
American 0
contractors 0
in 0
the 0
nuclear 0
industry 0
with 0
kickbacks 0
and 0
extortion 0
threats, 0
all 0
of 0
which 0
raised 0
legitimate 0
national 1
security 1
concerns. 0

And 0
none 0
of 0
that 0
evidence 0
got 0
aired 0
before 0
the 0
Obama 0
administration 0
made 0
those 0
decisions,” 0
a 0
person 0
who 0
worked 0
on 0
the 0
case 0
told 0
The 0
Hill, 0
speaking 0
on 0
condition 0
of 0
anonymity 0
for 0
fear 0
of 0
retribution 0
by 0
U.S. 0
or 0
Russian 0
officials.” 0

Based 0
on 0
what 0
the 0
FBI 0
knew 0
– 0
including 0
evidence 0
which 0
purportedly 0
includes 0
a 0
video 0
of 0
Russians 0
preparing 0
briefcases 0
of 0
bribe 0
money 0
– 0
the 0
Uranium 0
One 0
deal 0
never 0
should 0
have 0
gone 0
through. 0

Moreover, 0
both 0
Robert 0
Mueller 0
and 0
current 0
deputy 0
Attorney 0
General 0
Rod 0
Rosenstein 0
were 0
directly 0
involved 0
– 0
and 0
current 0
Attorney 0
General 0
Jeff 0
Sessions 0
and 0
other 0
Justice 0
Department 0
officials 0
appear 0
to 0
be 0
covering 0
for 0
them. 0

In 0
short, 0
the 0
FBI 0
had 0
ample 0
evidence 0
of 0
the 0
Russian 0
bribery 0
plot 0
before 0
the 0
Obama 0
administration 0
approved 0
the 0
Uranium 0
One 0
deal 0
thanks 0
to 0
their 0
embedded 0
mole 0
in 0
the 0
Russian 0
nuclear 0
industry. 0

The 0
informant 0
– 0
outed 0
as 0
energy 0
consultant 0
William 0
Campbell 0
– 0
was 0
“threatened” 1
by 0
Obama 0
admin 0
AG 0
Loretta 0
Lynch 0
to 0
keep 0
quiet 0
with 0
an 0
iron-clad 0
gag 0
order, 0
according 0
to 0
his 0
attorney 0
– 0
former 1
Reagan 1
Justice 1
Dept. 1

official 0
and 0
former 0
Chief 0
Counsel 0
to 0
the 0
Senate 0
Intelligence 0
Committee 0
Victoria 0
Toensing. 0

After 0
Senate 0
Judiciary 0
Committee 0
Chairman 0
Chuck 0
Grassley 0
(R-VA) 0
demanded 0
Campbell 0
be 0
allowed 0
to 0
testify 0
in 0
front 0
of 0
Congress, 0
the 0
gag 0
order 0
was 0
lifted. 0

Attorney 0
General 0
Jeff 0
Sessions 0
originally 0
tried 0
to 0
claim 0
that 0
there 0
was 0
no 0
connection 0
between 0
Uranium 0
One 0
and 0
the 0
nuclear 0
transport 0
bribery 0
case, 0
however 0
several 0
congressional 0
republicans 0
pushed 0
back: 0

“Attorney 0
General 0
Sessions 0
seemed 0
to 0
say 0
that 0
the 0
bribery, 0
racketeering 0
and 0
money 0
laundering 0
offenses 0
involving 0
Tenex’s 0
Vadim 0
Mikerin 0
occurred 0
after 0
the 0
approval 0
of 0
the 0
Uranium 0
One 0
deal 0
by 0
the 0
Obama 0
administration. 0

But 0
we 0
know 0
that 0
the 0
FBI’s 0
confidential 0
informant 0
was 0
actively 0
compiling 0
incriminating 0
evidence 0
as 0
far 0
back 0
as 0
2009,” 0
Rep. 0
Ron 0
DeSantis, 0
(R-Fla.) 0
told 0
The 0
Hill. 0

“It 0
is 0
hard 0
to 0
fathom 0
how 0
such 0
a 0
transaction 0
could 0
have 0
been 0
approved 0
without 0
the 0
existence 0
of 0
the 0
underlying 0
corruption 0
being 0
disclosed. 0

I 0
hope 0
AG 0
Sessions 0
gets 0
briefed 0
about 0
the 0
CI 0
and 0
gives 0
the 0
Uranium 0
One 0
case 0
the 0
scrutiny 0
it 0
deserves,” 0
added 0
DeSantis, 0
whose 0
House 0
Oversight 0
and 0
Government 0
Reform 0
subcommittees 0
is 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
investigating 0
panels. 0

Senate 0
Judiciary 0
Committee 0
Chairman 0
Chuck 0
Grassley 0
(R-Iowa) 0
sent 0
a 0
similar 0
rebuke 0
last 0
week 0
to 0
Rosenstein, 0
saying 0
the 0
deputy 0
attorney 0
general’s 0
first 0
response 0
to 0
the 0
committee 0
“largely 0
missed 0
the 0
point” 0
of 0
the 0
congressional 0
investigations. 0

“The 0
essential 0
question 0
is 0
whether 0
the 0
Obama 0
Justice 0
Department 0
provided 0
notice 0
of 0
the 0
criminal 0
activity 0
of 0
certain 0
officials 0
before 0
the 0
CFIUS 0
approval 0
of 0
the 0
Uranium 0
One 0
deal 0
and 0
other 0
government 0
decisions 0
that 0
enabled 0
the 0
Russians 0
to 0
trade 0
nuclear 0
materials 0
in 0
the 0
U.S,” 0
Grassley 0
scolded.” 0

Meanwhile, 0
journalists 0
John 0
Solomon 0
and 0
journalist 0
Sara 0
Carter 0
claim 0
to 0
have 0
copies 0
of 0
the 0
FBI 0
informant’s 0
evidence, 0
while 0
Carter 0
issued 0
an 0
explosive 0
report 0
in 0
late 0
November 0
laying 0
out 0
the 0
players, 0
the 0
timeline, 0
and 0
the 0
evidence 0
at 0
hand. 0

“By 0
the 0
time 0
the 0
sale 0
of 0
Uranium 0
One 0
was 0
approved 0
by 0
the 0
Obama 0
Administration, 0
the 0
FBI’s 0
investigators 0
had 0
already 0
gathered 0
substantial 0
evidence 0
and 0
the 0
bureau 0
was 0
also 0
aware 0
of 0
Russia’s 0
intentions 0
to 0
enter 0
the 0
U.S. 0
energy 0
market 0
and 0
its 0
desire 0
to 0
purchase 0
a 0
stake 0
in 0
American 0
uranium,” 0
Carter 0
writes. 0

Highlights: 0

FBI 0
mole 0
William 0
Campbell 0
was 0
a 0
highly 0
valued 0
FBI 0
asset 0
– 0
paid 0
$51,000 0
by 0
FBI 0
officials 0
at 0
a 0
celebration 0
dinner 0
in 0
Chrystal 0
City, 0
VA, 0
where 0
Campbell’s 0
attorney 0
says 0
they 0
thanked 0
him 0
for 0
his 0
service. 0

Campbell 0
was 0
required 0
by 0
the 0
Russians, 0
under 0
threat, 0
to 0
launder 0
large 0
sums 0
of 0
money 0
– 0
which 0
allowed 0
the 0
FBI 0
to 0
uncover 0
a 0
massive 0
Russian 0
“nuclear 0
money 0
laundering 0
apparatus” 0

Campbell 0
collected 0
over 0
5,000 0
documents 0
and 0
briefs 0
over 0
a 0
six 0
year 0
period 0

Campbell 0
uncovered 0
a 0
Russian 0
plot 0
to 0
penetrate 0
the 0
Obama 0
administration 0
and 0
gain 0
approval 0
for 0
the 0
Uranium 0
One 0
sale, 0
including 0
a 0
2010 0
email 0
which 0
describes 0
“Russia’s 0
intent 0
on 0
expanding 0
its 0
Uranium 0
expansion 0
in 0
the 0
United 0
States.” 0

“This 0
is 0
not 0
just 0
about 0
bribery 0
and 0
kickbacks 0
but 0
about 0
a 0
U.S. 0
company 0
that 0
was 0
transporting 0
yellow-cake 0
for 0
the 0
Russians 0
with 0
our 0
approval,” 0
an 0
unnamed 0
U.S. 0
Intelligence 0
official 0
told 0
Carter, 0
adding 0
“This 0
should 0
raise 0
serious 0
questions. 0

At 0
the 0
time 0
everyone 0
was 0
concerned 0
about 0
Russia’s 0
ties 0
to 0
Iran, 0
we 0
still 0
are. 0

And 0
of 0
course, 0
Russia’s 0
intentions 0
and 0
reach 0
into 0
the 0
U.S. 0
energy 0
market.” 0

Given 0
Friday’s 0
unsealed 0
indictment, 0
however 0
it 0
looks 0
like 0
the 0
DOJ 0
may 0
have 0
changed 0
their 0
tune 0
on 0
Campbell. 0

If 0
so, 0
perhaps 0
that 0
“briefcase 0
full 0
of 0
bribe 0
money” 0
video 0
will 0
finally 0
see 0
the 0
light 0
of 0
day. 0
