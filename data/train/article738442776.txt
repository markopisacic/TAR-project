As 0

Haspel’s 0
long 0
career 0
at 0
the 0

spanned 0
the 0
years 0
of 0
torture 0
carried 0
out 0

A 0
2013 0
Washington 0
Post 0
report 0
on 0
the 0
new 0
CIA 0
head 0
called 1
her 1
role 1
in 1
the 1
torture 1
programs 1
of 1
that 1
era 1
“extensive” 1
and 1
noted 1
that 1
at 1
one 1
point 1
she 1
ran 1
a 1
CIA 1
“black 1
site” 1
in 0
Thailand 0
where 0
torture 0
occurred. 0

In 0
a 0
lengthy 0
statement 0
following 0
Haspel’s 0
nomination, 0
McCain 0
expressed 0
big 0
concerns 0
about 0
what 0
it 0
means 0
for 0
the 0
agency’s 0
future, 0
saying: 0

During 0
his 0
own 0
confirmation 0
proceedings 0
for 0
Director 0
of 0
the 0
CIA, 0
Mike 0
Pompeo 0
repeatedly 0
committed 0
that 0
he 0
would 0
comply 0
with 0
the 0
law 0
that 0
applies 0
the 0
Army 0
Field 0
Manual’s 0
interrogation 0
requirements 0
to 0
all 0
U.S. 0
agencies, 0
including 0
the 0
CIA. 0

The 0
American 0
people 0
now 0
deserve 0
the 0
same 0
assurances 0
from 0
Gina 0
Haspel, 0
whose 0
career 0
with 0
the 0
agency 0
has 0
intersected 0
with 0
the 0
program 0
of 0
so-called 0
‘enhanced 0
interrogation 0
techniques’ 0
on 0
a 0
number 0
of 0
occasions. 0

The 0
torture 0
of 0
detainees 0
in 0
U.S. 0
custody 0
during 0
the 0
last 0
decade 0
was 0
one 1
of 1
the 1
darkest 1
chapters 1
in 1
American 1
history. 1

Ms. 0
Haspel 0
needs 0
to 0
explain 0
the 0
nature 0
and 0
extent 0
of 0
her 0
involvement 0
in 0
the 0
CIA’s 0
interrogation 0
program 0
during 0
the 0
confirmation 0
process. 0

I 0
know 0
the 0
Senate 0
will 0
do 0
its 0
job 0
in 0
examining 0
Ms. 0
Haspel’s 0
record 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
her 0
beliefs 0
about 0
torture 0
and 0
her 0
approach 0
to 0
current 0
law. 0

In 0
the 0
aftermath 0
of 0
the 0
September 0
11th 0
attacks, 0
our 0
government 0
squandered 0
precious 0
moral 0
authority 0
in 0
a 0
futile 1
effort 1
to 0
produce 0
intelligence 0
by 0
means 0
of 0
torture. 0

We 0
are 0
still 0
dealing 0
with 0
the 0
consequences 0
of 0
that 0
desperately 1
misguided 1
decision. 1

Current 0
U.S. 0
law 0
is 0
clear 0
in 0
banning 0
enhanced 0
interrogation 0
techniques. 0

Any 0
nominee 0
for 0
Director 0
of 0
the 0
CIA 0
must 0
pledge 0
without 0
reservation 0
to 0
uphold 0
this 0
prohibition, 0
which 0
has 0
helped 0
us 0
to 0
regain 0
our 0
position 0
of 0
leadership 0
in 0
the 0
struggle 0
for 0
universal 0
human 0
rights—the 0
struggle 1
upon 1
which 1
this 1
country 1
was 1
founded, 1
and 1
which 1
remains 1
its 1
highest 1
aspiration. 1

Americans 1
who 1
value 1
the 1
Constitution 1
should 1
take 1
this 1
rare 1
moment 1
to 1
agree 1
with 1
McCain. 1
