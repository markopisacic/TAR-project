What 0

does 0
the 0

make? 0

Mr 0

sent 0
the 0
text 0
of 0
his 0
letter 0
(written 0
in 0
Spanish) 0
to 0
BBC 0
News, 0
showing 0
it 0
was 0
addressed 0
personally 0
to 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
and 0
dated 0
3 0
March 0
2015. 0

That 0
was 0
more 0
than 0
two 0
weeks 0
before 0
the 0
bishop's 0
ordination 0
in 0
the 0
south 0
Chilean 0
city 0
of 0
Osorno, 0
an 0
event 0
dramatically 1
disrupted 1
by 0
hundreds 0

protesters 0
accusing 0
Bishop 0
Barros 0
of 0
covering 0
up 0
Karadima's 0
sex 0
attacks 0
on 0
young 0
boys. 0

The 0
bishop 0
has 0
denied 0
ever 0
knowing 0
about 0
"the 0
serious 0
abuses" 0
committed 0
by 0
Karadima, 0
who 0
was 0
never 0
prosecuted 0
in 0
Chile 0
because 0
so 0
much 0
time 0
had 0
passed 0
but 0
was 0
convicted 0
and 0
sentenced 0
by 0
the 0
Vatican 0
to 0
a 0
lifetime 0
of 0
"penance 0
and 0
prayer". 0

"Holy 0
Father, 0
I 0
decided 0
to 0
write 0
this 0
letter 0
to 0
you 0
because 0
I'm 0
tired 1
of 1
fighting, 1
crying 1
and 1
suffering," 1

"Our 0

is 0
well 0
known 0
and 0
there's 0
no 0
point 0
reminding 0
you 0
of 0
it, 0
except 0
to 0
tell 0
you 0
of 0
the 0
horror 1
of 1
having 1
experienced 1
this 1
abuse 1
and 1
how 1
I 1
wanted 1
to 1
kill 1
myself." 1

In 0
his 0
letter, 0
he 0
also 0
attaches 0
the 0
full 0
text 0
of 0
a 0
previous 0
letter 0
written 0
a 0
month 0
earlier 0
to 0
the 0
Vatican's 0
top 0
diplomat 0
in 0
Chile, 0
Archbishop 0
Ivo 0
Scapolo. 0

In 0
that 0
letter, 0
Mr 0
Cruz 0
accuses 0
Bishop 0
Barros 0
of 0
"doing 1
all 1
the 1
dirty 1
work 1
of 0
Fernando 0
Karadima", 0
and 0
describes 0
the 0
abuse 0
he 0
suffered 0
and 0
which 0
Bishop 0
Barros 0
allegedly 0
witnessed. 0

"When 0
we 0
were 0
in 0
a 0
room 0
with 0
Karadima 0
and 0
Juan 0
Barros, 0
if 0
he 0
[Barros] 0
wasn't 0
kissing 0
Karadima, 0
he 0
watched 0
as 0
one 0
of 0
us, 0
the 0
youngest, 0
was 0
touched 0
by 0
Karadima 0
and 0
forced 0
to 0
give 0
him 0
kisses," 0
he 0
writes. 0

"Karadima 0
would 0
say 0
to 0
me: 0
'Put 0
your 0
mouth 0
next 0
to 0
mine 0
and 0
stick 0
out 0
your 0
tongue.' 0

He'd 0
stick 0
out 0
his 0
and 0
kiss 0
us 0
with 0
his 0
tongue. 0

Juan 0
Barros 0
witnessed 0
all 0
of 0
this 0
on 0
countless 0
occasions, 0
not 0
just 0
in 0
my 0
case 0
but 0
in 0
the 0
case 0
of 0
others 0
as 0
well." 0

Addressing 0
himself 0
to 0
Pope 0
Francis, 0
Mr 0
Cruz 0
says: 0
"Holy 0
Father, 0
Juan 0
Barros 0
says 0
he 0
saw 0
nothing 0
and 0
yet, 0
there 0
are 0
dozens 0
of 0
us 0
who 0
can 0
testify 0
to 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
not 0
only 0
was 0
he 0
present 0
when 0
Karadima 0
abused 0
us, 0
but 0
that 0
he, 0
too, 0
kissed 0
Karadima 0
and 0
they 0
touched 0
each 0
other." 0

He 0
concludes 0
the 0
letter 0
with 0
this 0
appeal: 0
"Please 0
Holy 0
Father, 0
don't 1
be 1
like 1
the 1
others. 1

There 0
are 0
so 0
many 0
of 0
us 0
who 0
despite 0
everything 0
think 0
that 0
you 0
can 0
do 0
something. 0

I 0
treasure 0
my 0
faith, 0
it's 0
what 0
sustains 0
me, 0
but 0
it 0
is 0
slipping 0
away 0
from 0
me." 0

Hasn't 0
the 0
Pope 0
already 0
apologised? 0

only 0
punished 0
by 0
the 0
Vatican 0

The 0
remarks 0
that 0
the 0
Pope 0
had 0
made 0
in 0
January 0
that 0
caused 0
such 0
offence 0
were: 0
"The 0
day 0
they 0
bring 0
me 0
proof 0
against 0
Bishop 0
Barros, 0
then 0
I 0
will 0
speak. 0

There 0
is 0
not 0
a 0
single 0
piece 0
of 0
proof 0
against 0
him. 0

Everything 0
is 0
slander. 0

Is 0
this 0
clear?" 0

The 0
Pope 0
later 0
apologised 0
for 0
hurting 0
victims' 0
feelings 0
"without 0
meaning 0
to" 0
but 0
continued 0
to 0
insist 0
there 0
was 0
"no 0
evidence" 0
against 0
the 0
bishop. 0

"In 0
Barros's 0
case, 0
it 0
was 0
studied," 0
he 0
said. 0

"It 0
was 0
restudied. 0

And 0
there 0
is 0
no 0
evidence... 0

I 0
don't 0
have 0
evidence 0
to 0
convict." 0
