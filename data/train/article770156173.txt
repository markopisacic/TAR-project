What 0 76 3
President 0 76 3
Trump 0 76 3
really 0 76 3
meant 0 76 3
is 0 76 3
that 0 76 3
he 0 76 3

painted 0 76 3

with 0 76 3
all 0 76 3
his 0 76 3
threats 0 76 3

really 0 76 3
does 0 76 3
not 0 76 3

Good. 0 76 5

No 0 76 6
action 0 76 6
on 0 76 6

Korea 0 76 6

small 0 76 21

are 0 76 22
very 1 76 22
eccentric 1 76 22

not 1 76 22

Almost 0 76 23
equally 0 76 23
important, 0 76 23

be 1 76 25
a 1 76 25

Korea’s 0 76 42
new 0 76 42

The 0 76 47
US 0 76 47

spent 0 76 47
over 0 76 47
$200 0 76 47
billion 0 76 47
on 0 76 47
ballistic 0 76 47

recent 0 76 47

stop 0 76 47

missiles. 0 76 47

Unfortunately, 0 76 48
these 0 76 48
ABM 0 76 48
systems 0 76 48
don’t 0 76 48
work 0 76 48
very 0 76 48
well. 0 76 48

More 0 76 49
tens 1 76 49
of 1 76 49
billions 1 76 49
will 0 76 49
have 0 76 49
to 0 76 49
be 0 76 49
spent 0 76 49
before 0 76 49
these 0 76 49
anti-missile 0 76 49

become 0 76 49
reliable. 0 76 49

Would 0 76 50
it 0 76 50
not 0 76 50
be 0 76 50
easier 0 76 50
and 0 76 50
