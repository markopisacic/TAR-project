Obama 0 251 0
Secretly 0 251 0
Tried 0 251 0
to 0 251 0
Get 0 251 0
Banks 0 251 0
to 0 251 0
Aid 0 251 0
Iran, 0 251 0
Banks 0 251 0
Refused 0 251 0

International 0 251 1
financial 0 251 1
institutions 0 251 1
get 0 251 1
a 0 251 1
lot 0 251 1
of 0 251 1
heat 0 251 1
for 0 251 1
terror 0 251 1
state 0 251 1
ties. 0 251 1

But 0 251 2
this 0 251 2
is 0 251 2
a 0 251 2
case 0 251 2
where 0 251 2
Obama 0 251 2
Inc. 0 251 2
tried 0 251 2
to 0 251 2
get 0 251 2
them 0 251 2
to 0 251 2
do 0 251 2
the 0 251 2
wrong 0 251 2
thing. 0 251 2

While 0 251 3
they 0 251 3
did 0 251 3
the 0 251 3
right 0 251 3
thing. 0 251 3

The 0 251 4
Obama 0 251 4
administration 0 251 4
secretly 0 251 4
sought 0 251 4
to 0 251 4
give 0 251 4
Iran 0 251 4
access 0 251 4
— 0 251 4
albeit 0 251 4
briefly 0 251 4
— 0 251 4
to 0 251 4
the 0 251 4
U.S. 0 251 4
financial 0 251 4
system 0 251 4
by 0 251 4
sidestepping 0 251 4
sanctions 0 251 4
kept 0 251 4
in 0 251 4
place 0 251 4
after 0 251 4
the 0 251 4
2015 0 251 4
nuclear 0 251 4
deal, 0 251 4
despite 0 251 4
repeatedly 0 251 4
telling 0 251 4
Congress 0 251 4
and 0 251 4
the 0 251 4
public 0 251 4
it 0 251 4
had 0 251 4
no 0 251 4
plans 0 251 4
to 0 251 4
do 0 251 4
so. 0 251 4

Yet 0 251 5
another 0 251 5
Obama 0 251 5
dirty 1 251 5
deal 1 251 5
with 0 251 5
Iran 0 251 5
that 0 251 5
we're 0 251 5
just 0 251 5
learning 0 251 5
about 0 251 5
now. 0 251 5

The 0 251 6
question 0 251 6
is 0 251 6
how 1 251 6
many 1 251 6
more 1 251 6
are 1 251 6
there? 1 251 6

And 0 251 7
that's 0 251 7
part 0 251 7
of 0 251 7
why 0 251 7
Spygate 0 251 7
is 0 251 7
happening. 0 251 7

The 0 251 8
assault 0 251 8
is 0 251 8
also 0 251 8
a 0 251 8
cover-up. 0 251 8

The 0 251 9
report 0 251 9
by 0 251 9
the 0 251 9
Senate 0 251 9
Permanent 0 251 9
Subcommittee 0 251 9
on 0 251 9
Investigations 0 251 9
revealed 0 251 9
that 0 251 9
under 0 251 9
President 0 251 9
Barack 0 251 9
Obama, 0 251 9
the 0 251 9
Treasury 0 251 9
Department 0 251 9
issued 0 251 9
a 0 251 9
license 0 251 9
in 0 251 9
February 0 251 9
2016, 0 251 9
never 0 251 9
previously 0 251 9
disclosed, 0 251 9
that 0 251 9
would 0 251 9
have 0 251 9
allowed 0 251 9
Iran 0 251 9
to 0 251 9
convert 0 251 9
$5.7 0 251 9
billion 0 251 9
it 0 251 9
held 0 251 9
at 0 251 9
a 0 251 9
bank 0 251 9
in 0 251 9
Oman 0 251 9
from 0 251 9
Omani 0 251 9
rials 0 251 9
into 0 251 9
euros 0 251 9
by 0 251 9
exchanging 0 251 9
them 0 251 9
first 0 251 9
into 0 251 9
U.S. 0 251 9
dollars. 0 251 9

If 0 251 10
the 0 251 10
Omani 0 251 10
bank 0 251 10
had 0 251 10
allowed 0 251 10
the 0 251 10
exchange 0 251 10
without 0 251 10
such 0 251 10
a 0 251 10
license, 0 251 10
it 0 251 10
would 0 251 10
have 0 251 10
violated 0 251 10
sanctions 0 251 10
that 0 251 10
bar 0 251 10
Iran 0 251 10
from 0 251 10
transactions 0 251 10
that 0 251 10
touch 0 251 10
the 0 251 10
U.S. 0 251 10
financial 0 251 10
system. 0 251 10

The 0 251 11
effort 0 251 11
was 0 251 11
unsuccessful 0 251 11
because 0 251 11
American 0 251 11
banks 0 251 11
— 0 251 11
themselves 0 251 11
afraid 0 251 11
of 0 251 11
running 0 251 11
afoul 0 251 11
of 0 251 11
U.S. 0 251 11
sanctions 0 251 11
— 0 251 11
declined 0 251 11
to 0 251 11
participate. 0 251 11

The 0 251 12
Obama 0 251 12
administration 0 251 12
approached 0 251 12
two 0 251 12
U.S. 0 251 12
banks 0 251 12
to 0 251 12
facilitate 0 251 12
the 0 251 12
conversion, 0 251 12
the 0 251 12
report 0 251 12
said, 0 251 12
but 0 251 12
both 0 251 12
refused, 0 251 12
citing 0 251 12
the 0 251 12
reputational 0 251 12
risk 0 251 12
of 0 251 12
doing 0 251 12
business 0 251 12
with 0 251 12
or 0 251 12
for 0 251 12
Iran. 0 251 12

That's 0 251 13
how 0 251 13
bad 1 251 13
Obama 0 251 13
was 0 251 13
on 0 251 13
Iran. 0 251 13

The 0 251 14
banking 0 251 14
system 0 251 14
was 0 251 14
more 0 251 14
reluctant 0 251 14
to 0 251 14
help 0 251 14
Iran 0 251 14
launder 0 251 14
money 0 251 14
than 0 251 14
he 0 251 14
was. 0 251 14

Nor 0 251 15
was 0 251 15
Obama 0 251 15
worried 0 251 15
about 0 251 15
the 0 251 15
reputational 0 251 15
risk 0 251 15
of 0 251 15
loading 0 251 15
foreign 0 251 15
currency 0 251 15
on 0 251 15
unmarked 0 251 15
cargo 0 251 15
planes 0 251 15
and 0 251 15
flying 0 251 15
it 0 251 15
to 0 251 15
Iran. 0 251 15

Issuing 0 251 16
the 0 251 16
license 0 251 16
was 0 251 16
not 0 251 16
illegal. 0 251 16

Still, 0 251 17
it 0 251 17
went 0 251 17
above 0 251 17
and 0 251 17
beyond 0 251 17
what 0 251 17
the 0 251 17
Obama 0 251 17
administration 0 251 17
was 0 251 17
required 0 251 17
to 0 251 17
do 0 251 17
under 0 251 17
the 0 251 17
terms 0 251 17
of 0 251 17
the 0 251 17
nuclear 0 251 17
agreement. 0 251 17

Except 0 251 18
Obama 0 251 18
Inc. 0 251 18
weren't 0 251 18
trying 0 251 18
to 0 251 18
drive 0 251 18
a 0 251 18
hard 0 251 18
bargain. 0 251 18

So 0 251 19
they 0 251 19
didn't 0 251 19
stick 0 251 19
to 0 251 19
it. 0 251 19

They 0 251 20
were 0 251 20
trying 0 251 20
to 0 251 20
aid 0 251 20
Iran. 0 251 20

Shortly 0 251 21
after 0 251 21
the 0 251 21
nuclear 0 251 21
deal 0 251 21
was 0 251 21
sealed 0 251 21
in 0 251 21
July 0 251 21
2015, 0 251 21
then-Treasury 0 251 21
Secretary 0 251 21
Jack 0 251 21
Lew 0 251 21
testified 0 251 21
that 0 251 21
even 0 251 21
with 0 251 21
the 0 251 21
sanctions 0 251 21
relief, 0 251 21
Iran 0 251 21
“will 0 251 21
continue 0 251 21
to 0 251 21
be 0 251 21
denied 0 251 21
access 0 251 21
to 0 251 21
the 0 251 21
world’s 0 251 21
largest 0 251 21
financial 0 251 21
and 0 251 21
commercial 0 251 21
market.” 0 251 21
A 0 251 21
month 0 251 21
later, 0 251 21
one 0 251 21
of 0 251 21
Lew’s 0 251 21
top 0 251 21
deputies, 0 251 21
Adam 0 251 21
Szubin, 0 251 21
testified 0 251 21
that 0 251 21
despite 0 251 21
the 0 251 21
nuclear 0 251 21
deal 0 251 21
“Iran 0 251 21
will 0 251 21
be 0 251 21
denied 0 251 21
access 0 251 21
to 0 251 21
the 0 251 21
world’s 0 251 21
most 1 251 21
important 1 251 21
market 1 251 21
and 0 251 21
unable 0 251 21
to 0 251 21
deal 0 251 21
in 0 251 21
the 0 251 21
world’s 0 251 21
most 1 251 21
important 1 251 21
currency.” 1 251 21

This 0 251 22
was 0 251 22
typical 0 251 22
of 0 251 22
the 0 251 22
worthless 1 251 22
assurances 0 251 22
that 0 251 22
Obama 0 251 22
officials 0 251 22
made. 0 251 22

And 0 251 23
disgraced 1 251 23
themselves 0 251 23
by 0 251 23
doing 0 251 23
so. 0 251 23

Obama 0 251 24
administration 0 251 24
officials 0 251 24
at 0 251 24
the 0 251 24
time 0 251 24
assured 0 251 24
concerned 0 251 24
lawmakers 0 251 24
that 0 251 24
a 0 251 24
general 0 251 24
license 0 251 24
wouldn’t 0 251 24
be 0 251 24
coming. 0 251 24

But 0 251 25
the 0 251 25
report 0 251 25
from 0 251 25
the 0 251 25
Republican 0 251 25
members 0 251 25
of 0 251 25
the 0 251 25
Senate 0 251 25
panel 0 251 25
showed 0 251 25
that 0 251 25
a 0 251 25
draft 0 251 25
of 0 251 25
the 0 251 25
license 0 251 25
was 0 251 25
indeed 0 251 25
prepared, 0 251 25
though 0 251 25
it 0 251 25
was 0 251 25
never 0 251 25
published. 0 251 25

And 0 251 26
when 0 251 26
questioned 0 251 26
by 0 251 26
lawmakers 0 251 26
about 0 251 26
the 0 251 26
possibility 0 251 26
of 0 251 26
granting 0 251 26
Iran 0 251 26
any 0 251 26
kind 0 251 26
of 0 251 26
access 0 251 26
to 0 251 26
the 0 251 26
U.S. 0 251 26
financial 0 251 26
system, 0 251 26
Obama-era 0 251 26
officials 0 251 26
never 0 251 26
volunteered 0 251 26
that 0 251 26
the 0 251 26
specific 0 251 26
license 0 251 26
for 0 251 26
Bank 0 251 26
Muscat 0 251 26
in 0 251 26
Oman 0 251 26
had 0 251 26
been 0 251 26
issued 0 251 26
two 0 251 26
months 0 251 26
earlier. 0 251 26

Scandal-free 1 251 27
administration, 0 251 27
folks. 0 251 27

Not 0 251 28
a 0 251 28
single 0 251 28
scandal 1 251 28
to 0 251 28
see 0 251 28
here. 0 251 28

Not 1 251 28

a 1 251 28

one. 1 251 28
