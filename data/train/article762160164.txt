Obama 0
Secretly 0
Tried 0
to 0
Get 0
Banks 0
to 0
Aid 0
Iran, 0
Banks 0
Refused 0

International 0
financial 0
institutions 0
get 0
a 0
lot 0
of 0
heat 0
for 0
terror 0
state 0
ties. 0

But 0
this 0
is 0
a 0
case 0
where 0
Obama 0
Inc. 0
tried 0
to 0
get 0
them 0
to 0
do 0
the 0
wrong 0
thing. 0

While 0
they 0
did 0
the 0
right 0
thing. 0

The 0
Obama 0
administration 0
secretly 0
sought 0
to 0
give 0
Iran 0
access 0
— 0
albeit 0
briefly 0
— 0
to 0
the 0
U.S. 0
financial 0
system 0
by 0
sidestepping 0
sanctions 0
kept 0
in 0
place 0
after 0
the 0
2015 0
nuclear 0
deal, 0
despite 0
repeatedly 0
telling 0
Congress 0
and 0
the 0
public 0
it 0
had 0
no 0
plans 0
to 0
do 0
so. 0

Yet 0
another 0
Obama 0
dirty 1
deal 1
with 0
Iran 0
that 0
we're 0
just 0
learning 0
about 0
now. 0

The 0
question 0
is 0
how 1
many 1
more 1
are 1
there? 1

And 0
that's 0
part 0
of 0
why 0
Spygate 0
is 0
happening. 0

The 0
assault 0
is 0
also 0
a 0
cover-up. 0

The 0
report 0
by 0
the 0
Senate 0
Permanent 0
Subcommittee 0
on 0
Investigations 0
revealed 0
that 0
under 0
President 0
Barack 0
Obama, 0
the 0
Treasury 0
Department 0
issued 0
a 0
license 0
in 0
February 0
2016, 0
never 0
previously 0
disclosed, 0
that 0
would 0
have 0
allowed 0
Iran 0
to 0
convert 0
$5.7 0
billion 0
it 0
held 0
at 0
a 0
bank 0
in 0
Oman 0
from 0
Omani 0
rials 0
into 0
euros 0
by 0
exchanging 0
them 0
first 0
into 0
U.S. 0
dollars. 0

If 0
the 0
Omani 0
bank 0
had 0
allowed 0
the 0
exchange 0
without 0
such 0
a 0
license, 0
it 0
would 0
have 0
violated 0
sanctions 0
that 0
bar 0
Iran 0
from 0
transactions 0
that 0
touch 0
the 0
U.S. 0
financial 0
system. 0

The 0
effort 0
was 0
unsuccessful 0
because 0
American 0
banks 0
— 0
themselves 0
afraid 0
of 0
running 0
afoul 0
of 0
U.S. 0
sanctions 0
— 0
declined 0
to 0
participate. 0

The 0
Obama 0
administration 0
approached 0
two 0
U.S. 0
banks 0
to 0
facilitate 0
the 0
conversion, 0
the 0
report 0
said, 0
but 0
both 0
refused, 0
citing 0
the 0
reputational 0
risk 0
of 0
doing 0
business 0
with 0
or 0
for 0
Iran. 0

That's 0
how 0
bad 1
Obama 0
was 0
on 0
Iran. 0

The 0
banking 0
system 0
was 0
more 0
reluctant 0
to 0
help 0
Iran 0
launder 0
money 0
than 0
he 0
was. 0

Nor 0
was 0
Obama 0
worried 0
about 0
the 0
reputational 0
risk 0
of 0
loading 0
foreign 0
currency 0
on 0
unmarked 0
cargo 0
planes 0
and 0
flying 0
it 0
to 0
Iran. 0

Issuing 0
the 0
license 0
was 0
not 0
illegal. 0

Still, 0
it 0
went 0
above 0
and 0
beyond 0
what 0
the 0
Obama 0
administration 0
was 0
required 0
to 0
do 0
under 0
the 0
terms 0
of 0
the 0
nuclear 0
agreement. 0

Except 0
Obama 0
Inc. 0
weren't 0
trying 0
to 0
drive 0
a 0
hard 0
bargain. 0

So 0
they 0
didn't 0
stick 0
to 0
it. 0

They 0
were 0
trying 0
to 0
aid 0
Iran. 0

Shortly 0
after 0
the 0
nuclear 0
deal 0
was 0
sealed 0
in 0
July 0
2015, 0
then-Treasury 0
Secretary 0
Jack 0
Lew 0
testified 0
that 0
even 0
with 0
the 0
sanctions 0
relief, 0
Iran 0
“will 0
continue 0
to 0
be 0
denied 0
access 0
to 0
the 0
world’s 0
largest 0
financial 0
and 0
commercial 0
market.” 0
A 0
month 0
later, 0
one 0
of 0
Lew’s 0
top 0
deputies, 0
Adam 0
Szubin, 0
testified 0
that 0
despite 0
the 0
nuclear 0
deal 0
“Iran 0
will 0
be 0
denied 0
access 0
to 0
the 0
world’s 0
most 1
important 1
market 1
and 0
unable 0
to 0
deal 0
in 0
the 0
world’s 0
most 1
important 1
currency.” 1

This 0
was 0
typical 0
of 0
the 0
worthless 1
assurances 0
that 0
Obama 0
officials 0
made. 0

And 0
disgraced 1
themselves 0
by 0
doing 0
so. 0

Obama 0
administration 0
officials 0
at 0
the 0
time 0
assured 0
concerned 0
lawmakers 0
that 0
a 0
general 0
license 0
wouldn’t 0
be 0
coming. 0

But 0
the 0
report 0
from 0
the 0
Republican 0
members 0
of 0
the 0
Senate 0
panel 0
showed 0
that 0
a 0
draft 0
of 0
the 0
license 0
was 0
indeed 0
prepared, 0
though 0
it 0
was 0
never 0
published. 0

And 0
when 0
questioned 0
by 0
lawmakers 0
about 0
the 0
possibility 0
of 0
granting 0
Iran 0
any 0
kind 0
of 0
access 0
to 0
the 0
U.S. 0
financial 0
system, 0
Obama-era 0
officials 0
never 0
volunteered 0
that 0
the 0
specific 0
license 0
for 0
Bank 0
Muscat 0
in 0
Oman 0
had 0
been 0
issued 0
two 0
months 0
earlier. 0

Scandal-free 1
administration, 0
folks. 0

Not 0
a 0
single 0
scandal 1
to 0
see 0
here. 0

Not 1
a 1
one. 1
