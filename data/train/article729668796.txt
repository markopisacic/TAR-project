Orban's 0
words 0
are 0
reminiscent 0
of 0
those 0
of 0
US 0
President 0
Donald 0
Trump, 0
who 0
spoke 0
about 0
putting 0
"America 1

"The 0
presidency 0
of 0
Fidesz 0
has 0
discussed 0
yesterday 0
the 0
announcement 0
of 0
the 0
Belgian 0
Prime 0
Minister, 0
that 0
they 0
will 0
– 0
if 0
necessary 0
with 0
force 0
– 0
obligate 0
Central 0
European 0
countries, 0
including 0
Hungary, 0
to 0
accept 0
migrants,” 0
Orban 0
stated. 0

“According 0
to 0
their 0
plan, 0
this 0
will 0
happen 0
in 0
June 0
at 0
the 0
summit 0
of 0
the 0
prime 0
ministers 0
in 0
Brussels," 0

“Our 0

Orban 0
concluded. 0

According 0
to 0
the 0
Hungarian 0
Government's 0
website, 0
posted 0
about 0
the 0
ultimatum 0
that 0
was 0
given 0
over 0
the 0
weekend. 0

Over 0
the 0
weekend, 0
Belgian 0
prime 0
minister 0
Charles 0
Michel 0
spoke 0
about 0
sending 0
“an 0
ultimatum” 0
to 0
the 0
Visegrád 0
countries 0
which 0
“reject 0
solidarity”. 0

The 0
essence 0
of 0
this 0
ultimatum 0
would 0
be 0
that 0
if 0
by 0
the 0
end 0
of 0
June 0
a 0
consensus 0
is 0
not 0
reached 0
in 0
the 0
council 0
of 0
EU 0
heads 0
of 0
government, 0
then 0
the 0
planned 0
reforms 0
would 0
be 0
adopted 0
with 0
a 0
qualified 0
majority 0
vote 0
which 0
would 0
overrule 0
dissenters. 0

Minister 0
of 0
Foreign 0
Affairs 0
and 0
Trade 0
Péter 0
Szijjártó 0
said 0
on 0
Tuesday,“Hungary 0
will 1
not 1
become 1
an 1
immigrant 1
country, 1
it 1
has 1
never 1
admitted 1
and 1
will 1
never 1
admit 1
illegal 1
immigrants." 1

He 0
also 0
referred 0
to 0
Michel's 0
ultimatum 0
as 0
unacceptable 1
and 1
shocking. 1

“Hungary 1
has 1
never 1
admitted 1
and 1
will 1
never 1
admit 1
illegal 1
immigrants, 1
irrespective 0
of 0
whether 0
there 0
is 0
any 0
pressure 0
in 0
this 0
direction 0
along 0
the 0
borders 0
or 0
from 0
Brussels,” 0
Szijjártó 0
said. 0

“The 0
Belgian 0
Prime 0
Minister’s 0
statement 0
is 0
also 0
outrageous 1
because 0
this 0
is 0
the 0
first 0
time 0
that 0
people 0
in 0
Brussels 0
are 0
openly 0
planning 0
to 0
push 0
the 0
mandatory 0
resettlement 0
quota 0
through 0
by 0
force 0
while 0
totally 0
ignoring 0
the 0
will 0
of 0
certain 0
EU 0
member 0
states." 0

“We 0
regard 0
this 0
whole 0
thing 0
as 0
unacceptable 0
and 0
we 0
reject 0
it," 0
he 0
added. 0

“The 0
countries 0
of 0
the 0
Visegrád 0
Group 0
do 0
not 0
support 0
the 0
introduction 0
of 0
any 0
kind 0
of 0
mandatory 0
quota.” 0

“Perhaps 0
it 0
doesn’t 0
bother 0
the 0
Belgian 0
Prime 0
Minister 0
that 0
there 0
are 0
no-go 0
zones 0
in 0
many 0
Western 0
European 0
cities, 0
or 0
that 0
people 1
with 1
immigrant 1
backgrounds 1
have 1
committed 1
27 1
major 1
terrorist 1
attacks 1
in 1
Europe 1
recently, 0
but 0
this 0
bothers 0
the 0
V4 0
because 0
they 0
do 0
not 0
want 0
to 0
live 0
on 0
a 0
continent 0
were 0
the 1
threat 1
of 1
terrorism 1
becomes 1
an 1
everyday 1
regularity," 1
he 0
continued. 0

Just 0
this 0
week, 0
we 0
reported 0
that 0
Hungary 0
had 0
grown 0
weary 0
of 0
the 0
talks 0
of 0
pushing 0
illegal 0
Muslim 0
migrants 0
on 0
their 0
country 0
and 0
Europe, 0
and 0
was 0
preparing 0
to 0
walk 0
away 0
from 0
the 0
negotiating 0
table. 0

Orban 0
has 0
taken 0
a 0
tough 0
stance 0
in 0
Hungary. 0

He 0
has 0
ordered 1
all 1
illegal 1
Muslim 1
invaders 1
to 1
get 1
out 1
of 1
Hungary 1
and 1
never 1
come 1
back. 1

In 0
December, 0
he 0
said 0
that 0
he 0
was 0
not 0
concerned 0
with 0
what 0
Brussels 0
wanted, 0
but 0
was 0
determined 0
to 0
defend 0
Hungary's 0
borders. 0

PM 0
Orban 0
has 0
done 0
just 0
that, 0
too. 0

Orban's 0
border 0
wall 0
virtually 0
eliminated 0
illegal 0
immigration. 0

Orban 0
is 0
openly 1
Christian 1
and 0
seems 0
to 0
understand 0
something 0
that 0
many 0
do 0
not 0
and 0
that 0
is 0
you 0
do 0
not 0
allow 0
a 0
wholesale 0
flood 1
of 1
antichrists 1
to 0
pour 0
into 0
your 0
country. 0

Were 1
the 1
Ammonites 1
and 1
Moabites 1
not 1
kept 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
assembly 1
of 1
Israel 1
because 1
of 1
their 1
hatred 1
of 1
the 1
people 1
of 1
God? 1

(Deuteronoy 1
23:3-6) 1
Yes, 0
they 0
were. 0

While 0
Muslims 0
need 0
the 0
Gospel 0
for 0
sure, 0
one 1
cannot 1
allow 1
such 1
an 1
influx 1
into 1
the 1
country, 1
or 1
all 1
you 1
are 1
asking 1
for 1
is 1
the 1
judgments 1
God 1
warned 1
about 1
in 1
Deuteronomy 1
28. 1

I 0
say, 0
well 1
done 1
Mr. 0
Orban. 0

I 0
would 0
like 0
to 0
hear 0
more 0
of 0
that 0
kind 0
of 0
talk 0
from 0
America's 0
representatives. 0
