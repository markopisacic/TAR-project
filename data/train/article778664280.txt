Archbishop 0
Hebda 0
and 0
McCarrick's 0
Scandal 0

Archbishop 0
Bernard 0
Hebda 0
of 0
St. 0
Paul, 0
MN, 0
responds 0
to 0
the 0
McCarrick 0
scandal 0
(The 0
Catholic 0
Spirit): 0

Every 0
time 0
Mass 0
is 0
celebrated, 0
the 0
priest 0
prays 0
that 0
Jesus 0
will 0
“look 0
not 0
on 0
our 0
sins 0
but 0
on 0
the 0
faith 0
of 0
[his] 0
Church… 0
.” 0
That’s 0
been 0
an 0
important 0
prayer 0
for 0
me 0
in 0
the 0
time 0
that 0
I 0
have 0
been 0
serving 0
this 0
archdiocese, 0
well 0
aware 0
of 0
our 0
sins 0
but 0
equally 0
aware 0
of 0
the 1
strong 1
and 1
vibrant 1
faith 1
of 0
this 0
local 0
Church. 0

I’ve 0
been 0
praying 0
that 0
prayer 0
even 0
more 0
earnestly 0
in 0
these 0
past 0
weeks 0
as 0
the 0
Church 0
in 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
has 0
once 0
again 0
come 0
face-to-face 0
with 0
its 0
sins, 0
with 0
reports 0
that 0
former 0
cardinal 0
Theodore 0
McCarrick, 0
one 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
prominent 1
Churchmen 1
in 1
the 1
United 1
States 1
in 1
the 1
last 1
quarter 1
century, 1
has 0
been 0
accused 0
of 0
abusing 0
two 0
minors 0
and 0
sexually 0
harassing 0
or 0
assaulting 0
a 0
number 0
of 0
seminarians 0
and 0
young 0
priests. 0

To 1
make 1
matters 1
worse 1
(if 1
that 1
is 1
even 1
possible), 1
evidence 0
has 0
surfaced 0
that 0
indicates 0
that 0
a 0
bishop, 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
some 0
priests 0
and 0
laity, 0
had 0
brought 0
the 0
allegations 0
about 0
misconduct 0
with 0
seminarians 0
to 0
the 0
attention 0
of 0
Church 0
authorities 0
but 0
to 0
no 0
avail: 0
Archbishop 0
McCarrick 0
was 0
nonetheless 0
“promoted” 0
to 0
become 0
the 0
archbishop 0
in 0
our 1
nation’s 1
capital, 0
and 0
elevated 0
to 0
the 0
College 0
of 0
Cardinals. 0

While 0
I 0
realize 0
that 0
it 0
is 0
not 0
always 0
easy 0
to 0
evaluate 0
the 0
credibility 0
of 0
those 0
bringing 0
allegations, 0
and 0
that 0
there’s 0
often 0
a 0
tendency 0
to 0
believe 0
those 0
we 0
know 0
over 0
those 0
we 0
don’t, 0
I 1
don’t 1
think 1
that 1
the 1
Church 1
in 1
the 1
United 1
States 1
will 1
rest 1
— 1
and 1
confidence 1
will 1
be 1
restored 1
— 1
until 1
the 1
matter 1
is 1
independently 1
investigated 1
and 1
explained, 1
and 1
assurances 1
are 1
given 1
that 1
there 1
are 1
safeguards 1
in 1
place 1
to 1
make 1
sure 1
that 1
something 1
like 1
this 1
couldn’t 1
happen 1
again. 1

The 0
matter 0
has 0
been 0
particularly 0
troubling 0
to 0
me 0
personally 0
due 0
to 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
I 0
had 0
served 0
in 0
the 0
Archdiocese 0
of 0
Newark 0
as 0
coadjutor 0
archbishop 0
from 0
November 0
4, 0
2013, 0
to 0
March 0
25, 0
2016, 0
when 0
I 0
was 0
named 0
archbishop 0
here. 0

It 0
was 0
while 0
I 0
was 0
in 0
Newark 0
that 0
I 0
was 0
introduced 0
to 0
then-Cardinal 0
McCarrick. 0

A 0
number 0
of 0
good 1
Catholics 1
have 0
written 0
to 0
ask 0
for 0
a 0
personal 0
accounting 0
on 0
my 0
part, 0
inquiring 0
whether 0
I 0
was 0
made 0
aware 0
in 0
my 0
time 0
in 0
Newark 0
of 0
the 0
2005 0
and 0
2007 0
settlements 0
involving 0
Archbishop 0
McCarrick, 0
or 0
if 0
I 0
knew 0
of 0
any 0
allegations 0
against 0
him. 0

I 0
can 0
state 0
unequivocally 0
that 0
I 0
learned 0
of 0
those 0
settlements 0
only 0
in 0
June 0
of 0
this 0
year, 0
as 0
news 0
broke 0
about 0
the 0
unrelated 0
claim 0
that 0
had 0
been 0
filed 0
in 0
the 0
Archdiocese 0
of 0
New 0
York. 0

What 0
I 0
know 0
of 0
the 0
settlements 0
I 0
know 0
from 0
the 0
newspapers. 0

When 0
serving 0
in 0
Newark, 0
I 0
was 0
regularly 0
briefed 0
on 0
current 0
legal 0
matters 0
of 0
all 0
sorts, 0
but 0
not 0
on 0
past 0
legal 0
matters 0
(unless 0
they 0
were 0
still 0
being 0
discussed 0
in 0
the 0
press). 0

By 0
the 0
time 0
I 0
arrived 0
in 0
Newark 0
in 0
November 0
2013, 0
the 1
2005 1
and 1
2007 1
settlements 1
were 1
apparently 1
considered 1
ancient 1
history. 1

It 0
would 0
be 0
untrue 0
to 0
state 0
that 0
I 0
had 0
never 0
heard 0
any 0
allegations 0
about 0
Cardinal 0
McCarrick. 0

Years 0
before 0
I 0
ever 0
lived 0
in 0
Newark, 0
and 0
never 0
imagining 0
that 0
I 0
would 0
be 0
assigned 0
there, 0
I 0
had 0
indeed 0
read 0
— 0
as 0
a 1
somewhat 1
geeky 1
ex-lawyer 1
— 0
an 0
allegation 0
about 0
Cardinal 0
McCarrick 0
in 0
the 0
context 0
of 0
a 0
2005 0
lawsuit 0
in 0
the 0
Southern 0
District 0
of 0
New 0
York 0
against 0
Archbishop 0
Myers, 0
Cardinal 0
Eagan, 0
Bishop 0
Hubbard 0
and 0
the 0
Irish 0
Christian 0
Brothers. 0

While 0
the 0
complaint 0
didn’t 0
supply 0
any 0
details, 0
the 0
plaintiff 0
was 0
reported 0
to 0
have 0
said 0
to 0
a 0
journalist 0
that 0
“Archbishop 0
McCarrick 0
would 0
share 0
a 0
bed 0
with 0
seminarians 0
but 0
not 0
engage 0
in 0
any 0
activity 0
with 0
them.” 0
The 0
complaint 0
would 0
later 0
be 0
formally 0
amended 0
to 0
include 0
that 0
allegation. 0

Knowing, 0
however, 0
that 0
this 0
lawsuit 0
was 0
completely 0
dismissed 0
by 0
the 0
state 0
and 0
federal 0
courts, 0
I 0
never 0
gave 0
the 0
particular 0
allegation 0
about 0
Cardinal 0
McCarrick 0
any 0
credence. 0

I 0
can 0
also 0
state 0
without 0
exception 0
that 0
no 0
one 0
in 0
my 0
years 0
in 0
Newark 0
ever 0
told 0
me 0
that 0
they 0
were 0
improperly 0
touched 0
by 0
Archbishop 0
McCarrick, 0
and 0
no 0
one 0
ever 0
told 0
me 0
that 0
they 0
had 0
to 0
share 0
a 0
bed 0
with 0
him 0
or 0
that 0
they 0
had 0
seen 0
anyone 0
share 0
a 0
bed 0
with 0
him. 0

I 0
heard 0
lots 0
of 0
gut-wrenching 1
stories 1
in 0
my 0
two-and-a-half 0
years 0
there, 0
but 0
none 0
of 0
them 0
involved 0
Archbishop 0
McCarrick. 0

With 0
St. 0
John 0
Paul 0
II’s 0
1995 0
visit, 0
he 0
was 0
remembered 0
for 0
“bringing 1
a 1
saint 1
to 1
Newark,” 1
not 0
as 0
an 1
abuser 1
of 1
seminarians, 1
minors 1
or 1
priests. 1

When 0
I 0
was 0
installed 0
here 0
in 0
St. 0
Paul, 0
he 0
joined 0
me 0
at 0
lunch 0
along 0
with 0
my 0
father, 0
sister, 0
godmother 0
and 0
then 0
12-year-old 0
nephew. 0

I 0
can 0
assure 0
you 0
that 0
I 0
would 0
never 0
have 0
allowed 0
that 0
to 0
happen 0
if 0
I 0
had 0
any 0
reason 0
to 0
know 0
or 0
even 0
suspect 0
the 0
things 0
that 0
have 0
been 0
reported 0
in 0
the 0
newspapers 0
this 0
past 0
month. 0

While 0
the 0
letters 0
and 0
emails 0
of 0
recent 0
days 0
are 0
sober 1
reminders 1
that 0
there’s 0
still 0
a 0
long 0
way 0
to 0
go 0
in 0
restoring 0
trust, 0
I 0
nonetheless 0
welcome 0
the 0
efforts 0
to 0
hold 0
me 0
accountable 0
to 0
you, 0
the 0
faithful 0
of 0
this 0
archdiocese. 0

The 0
events 0
of 0
these 0
past 0
weeks 0
have 0
shown 0
that 0
no 1
one 1
can 1
be 1
above 1
the 1
law, 1
regardless 1
of 1
rank 1
or 1
privilege. 1

I 0
was 0
grateful 0
for 0
the 0
opportunity 0
to 0
reinforce 0
that 0
with 0
our 0
seminarians 0
this 0
past 0
weekend, 0
and 0
I 0
look 0
forward 0
to 0
continuing 0
my 0
work 0
with 0
the 0
Office 0
of 0
Ministerial 0
Standards 0
and 0
Safe 0
Environment, 0
and 0
our 0
Archdiocesan 0
Review 0
Board, 0
in 0
creating 0
a 0
culture 0
in 0
which 0
no 0
one 0
need 0
be 0
afraid 0
or 0
reluctant 0
to 0
bring 0
forth 0
an 0
allegation 0
of 0
misconduct. 0

Our 0
heavenly 1
patron, 1
St. 0
Paul, 0
reminds 0
us 0
that 0
“where 0
sin 0
abounds, 0
grace 0
abounds 0
all 0
the 0
more.” 0
May 0
these 0
difficult 0
days 0
be 0
days 0
of 0
great 0
grace 0
for 0
this 0
local 0
Church. 0

REMNANT 0
COMMENT: 0
While 0
we 0
certainly 0
appreciate 0
His 0
Excellency's 0
candid 1
explanation 1
of 0
what 0
he 0
knew 0
and 0
did 0
not 0
know 0
about 0
this 0
horrific 1
scandal 1
in 0
the 0
Church, 0
we 1
would 1
also 1
humbly 1
beg 1
him 1
to 1
take 1
it 1
one 1
step 1
further 1
by 1
publicly 1
proclaiming 1
his 1
profession 1
of 1
belief 1
in 1
the 1
Church's 1
official 1
teaching 1
against 1
the 1
mortal 1
sin 1
of 1
homosexual 1
acts 1
and 1
the 1
so-called 1
"gay 1
lifestyle," 1
which 1
includes 1
her 1
long-held 1
teaching 1
that 1
homosexual 1
activity 1
between 1
clerics 1
is 1
an 1
ecclesiastical 1
crime. 1

Far 0
from 0
being 0
reassured 0
of 0
this 0
by 0
their 0
bishops, 0
many 0
Catholic 0
faithful 0
today 0
are 0
informed 0
that 0
the 0
modern 0
Catholic 0
Church 0
is 0
now 0
an 1
"inclusive 1
community" 1
that 1
"welcomes 1
all" 1
and 1
"judges 1
none." 1

All 1
very 1
well 1
and 1
good, 1
except 1
for 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
the 1
Church's 1
constant 1
and 1
unchanging 1
moral 1
teaching 1
on 1
this 1
makes 1
no 1
such 1
allowance. 1

In 0
fact, 0
this 0
binding 0
and 0
constant 0
teaching 0
of 0
the 0
Church 0
was 0
reaffirmed 0
most 0
recently 0
in 0
her 0
most 0
authoritative 0
modern 0
catechism, 0
which 0
holds 0
the 0
exact 0
opposite 0
position 0
from 0
that 0
apparently 0
held 0
by 0
many 0
bishops: 0

Homosexuality 0
refers 0
to 0
relations 0
between 0
men 0
or 0
between 0
women 0
who 0
experience 0
an 0
exclusive 0
or 0
predominant 0
sexual 0
attraction 0
toward 0
persons 0
of 0
the 0
same 0
sex... 0
Basing 1
itself 1
on 1
Sacred 1
Scripture, 1
which 1
presents 1
homosexual 1
acts 1
as 1
acts 1
of 1
grave 1
depravity, 1
tradition 1
has 1
always 1
declared 1
that 1
"homosexual 1
acts 1
are 1
intrinsically 1
disordered." 1

They 1
are 1
contrary 1
to 1
the 1
natural 1
law. 1

They 1
close 1
the 1
sexual 1
act 1
to 1
the 1
gift 1
of 1
life. 1

They 1
do 1
not 1
proceed 1
from 1
a 1
genuine 1
affective 1
and 1
sexual 1
complementarity. 1

Under 1
no 1
circumstances 1
can 1
they 1
be 1
approved. 1

(Catechism 0
of 0
the 0
Catholic 0
Church, 0
2357) 0

Under 1
no 1
circumstances…except 1
for 1
those 1
dreamed 1
up 1
by 1
a 1
number 1
of 1
bishops 1
in 1
this 1
country 1
who 1
apparently 1
think 1
that 1
it 1
should 1
be 1
left 1
up 1
to 1
individual 1
parishes 1
to 1
decide 1
if 1
they 1
are 1
LGBTQ-friendly 1
or 1
not. 1

Even 0
Pope 1
John 1
Paul 1
"The 1
GREAT's" 1
Vatican 0
clarified 0
the 0
Church's 0
teaching 0
on 0
October 0
31, 0
1986, 0
in 0
the 0
“Letter 0
to 0
the 0
Bishops 0
of 0
the 0
Catholic 0
Church 0
on 0
the 0
Pastoral 0
Care 0
of 0
Homosexual 0
Persons”: 0

Although 0
the 0
particular 0
inclination 0
of 0
the 0
homosexual 0
person 0
is 0
not 0
a 0
sin, 0
it 0
is 0
a 0
more 0
or 0
less 0
strong 0
tendency 0
ordered 0
toward 0
an 0
intrinsic 0
moral 0
evil; 0
thus 1
the 1
inclination 1
itself 1
must 1
be 1
seen 1
as 1
an 1
objective 1
disorder. 1

Therefore 1
special 1
concern 1
and 1
pastoral 1
attention 1
should 1
be 1
directed 1
to 1
those 1
who 1
have 1
this 1
condition, 1
lest 1
they 1
be 1
led 1
to 1
believe 1
that 1
the 1
living 1
out 1
of 1
this 1
orientation 1
in 1
homosexual 1
activity 1
is 1
a 1
morally 1
acceptable 1
option. 1

It 1
is 1
not. 1

Notice 0
the 0
late 0
pope 0
does 0
not 0
say, 0
“Let 0
the 0
practicing 0
homosexuals 0
have 0
a 0
spiritual 0
home 0
among 0
your 0
faithful,” 0
as 0
Father 0
James 0
Martin 0
and 0
his 0
episcopal 1
fans 1
are 0
at 0
least 0
implying 0
on 0
a 0
regular 0
basis 0
in 0
the 0
media. 0

Does 0
Archbishop 0
Hebda 0
believe 0
it 0
is 0
time 0
for 0
the 0
Church 0
to 0
stop 1
humiliating 1
herself 1
by 1
stooping 1
to 1
accommodate 1
a 1
special 1
interest 1
group 1
that 1
obviously 1
doesn't 1
care 1
about 1
her 1
or 1
the 1
moral 1
code 1
by 1
which 1
she 1
governs? 1

Does 0
he 0
believe 0
that 0
all 0
Catholics 0
must 0
follow 0
the 0
rules 0
of 0
the 0
Church 0
pertaining 0
to 0
the 0
Sixth 0
Commandment...or 0
just 0
the 1
straight 1
Catholics? 1

Does 0
His 0
Excellency 0
believe 0
that 0
if 0
some 0
homosexual 0
Catholics 0
feel 0
they 0
need 0
not 0
bother 0
following 0
the 0
rules 0
they 0
should 0
be 0
warmly 0
welcomed 0
into 0
our 0
"Catholic 0
Christian" 0
community 0
anyway, 0
even 0
if 0
they 0
are 0
in 0
same-sex 0
unions? 0

Pope 0
John 0
Paul 0
certainly 0
didn't 0
accept 0
that. 0

In 0
his 0
2005 0
book 0
Memory 0
and 0
Identity, 0
John 0
Paul 0
referred 0
to 0
homosexuality 0
as 0
an 1
“ideology 1
of 1
evil,” 1
insisting 0
of 0
so-called 0
'gay 0
marriage' 0
that: 0

“It 0
is 0
legitimate 0
and 0
necessary 0
to 0
ask 0
oneself 0
if 0
this 0
is 0
not 0
perhaps 0
part 0
of 0
a 1
new 1
ideology 1
of 1
evil, 1
perhaps 0
more 1
insidious 1
and 0
hidden, 0
which 0
attempts 0
to 1
pit 1
human 1
rights 1
against 1
the 1
family 1
and 1
man.” 1

Was 0
Pope 1
John 1
Paul 1
THE 1
GREAT 1
an 1
intolerant 1
homophobe? 1

Are 1
Father 1
Martin 1
and 1
his 1
pals 1
in 1
the 1
episcopacy 1
really 1
so 1
enlightened 1
over 1
every 1
pope, 1
saint, 1
and 1
moral 1
theologian 1
in 1
history? 1

Or 1
is 1
it 1
not 1
so 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
both 1
negligent 1
and 1
uncharitable 1
for 1
some 1
bishops 1
to 1
refuse 1
to 1
inform 1
their 1
faithful 1
that 1
according 1
to 1
the 1
Church's 1
own 1
infallible 1
teaching, 1
everlasting 1
damnation 1
is 1
the 1
price 1
to 1
be 1
paid 1
for 1
this 1
kind 1
of 1
inclusivity 1
and 1
toleration? 1

And 0
if 0
the 0
episcopal 0
retort 0
is 0
going 0
to 0
be 0
that 0
this 0
acceptance 0
refers 0
only 0
to 0
chaste 0
homosexuals, 0
then 0
we 1
call 1
FOUL 1
even 1
louder 1
since 0
this 0
crosses 0
the 0
line 0
into 0
willful 1
deception. 1

We're 1
all 1
sinners, 1
of 1
course--- 1
and 0
the 0
Church 0
already 0
accepts 0
repentant 0
homosexuals 0
as 0
they 0
are, 0
just 0
as 0
she 0
accepts 0
repentant 0
practitioners 0
of 0
ANY 1
sins 1
of 1
the 1
flesh. 1

So 1
why 1
are 1
our 1
bishops 1
playing 1
dumb? 1

Quite 1
obviously, 1
it 1
is 1
because 1
what 1
they 1
are 1
actually 1
closing 1
an 1
episcopal 1
eye 1
to 1
are 1
the 1
folks 1
who 1
want 1
to 1
keep 1
right 1
on 1
sinning--and 1
sinning 1
proudly. 1

This 1
is 1
what 1
the 1
Church 1
of 1
Accompaniment 1
is 1
all 1
about! 1

But, 0
practically 0
speaking--in 0
the 0
real 0
world--this 0
kind 0
of 0
"accompaniment" 0
is 0
only 0
green-lighting 1
vice 1
and 1
mortal 1
sin, 1
and 0
as 0
such 0
constitutes 0
a 1
hideous 1
violation 1
of 1
everything 1
these 1
bishops 1
supposedly 1
believe 1
as 1
Catholic 1
priests. 1

So 0
what's 0
going 0
on 0
here? 0

Who 1
are 1
these 1
bishops 1
that 1
think 1
they 1
can 1
play 1
fast 1
and 1
loose 1
not 1
only 1
with 1
the 1
moral 1
theology 1
of 1
the 1
Catholic 1
Church, 1
but 1
also 1
with 1
the 1
immortal 1
souls 1
of 1
their 1
flock? 1

Is 1
it 1
any 1
wonder 1
that 1
priests 1
and 1
laity 1
alike 1
are 1
changing 1
their 1
attitude 1
on 1
the 1
"gay 1
lifestyle" 1
and 1
violations 1
of 1
the 1
Sixth 1
Commandment 1
when 1
so 1
many 1
bishops 1
are 1
working 1
to 1
remove 1
the 1
stigma 1
attached 1
to 1
this 1
sin 1
that 1
Scripture 1
tells 1
us 1
cries 1
to 1
heaven 1
for 1
vengeance? 1

The 1
Catholic 1
Church's 1
new-found 1
"climate 1
of 1
tolerance" 1
is 1
exactly 1
what 1
McCarrick 1
and 1
company 1
are 1
counting 1
on! 1

It 1
is 1
truly 1
homophobic 1
for 1
any 1
bishop 1
to 1
lie 1
to 1
the 1
gay 1
community 1
about 1
this, 1
and 1
to 1
risk 1
the 1
immortal 1
souls 1
of 1
the 1
sheep 1
merely 1
so 1
that 1
the 1
shepherd 1
might 1
pride 1
himself 1
on 1
occupying 1
the 1
politically 1
correct 1
high 1
ground. 1

This 1
is 1
gross 1
dereliction 1
of 1
duty, 1
and 1
we 1
hope 1
and 1
pray 1
that 1
all 1
the 1
good 1
U.S. 1
bishops 1
would 1
jump 1
at 1
the 1
opportunity 1
to 1
issue 1
statements 1
reaffirming 1
the 1
Church's 1
clear 1
teaching 1
against 1
all 1
sins 1
of 1
the 1
flesh, 1
homo- 1
and 1
heterosexual. 1

Again, 0
God 0
bless 0
Archbishop 0
Hebda 0
for 0
this 0
welcome 0
statement, 0
and 0
may 0
God 0
grant 0
him 0
the 0
courage 0
now 0
to 0
finish 0
the 0
task 0
by 0
publicly 0
reassuring 0
the 1
scandalized 1
faithful 1
that 0
it’s 0
not 0
just 0
abuse 0
of 0
minors 0
or 0
sexual 0
harassment 0
that’s 0
going 0
on 0
here. 0

Our 1
bishops 1
must 1
make 1
it 1
absolutely 1
clear 1
that 1
the 1
Church's 1
moral 1
theology 1
on 1
homosexuality 1
will 1
not 1
and 1
can 1
not 1
be 1
trumped 1
by 1
the 1
dictates 1
of 1
political 1
correctness. 1

And 0
neither 0
can 0
God's 0
law 0
be 0
changed 0
to 0
accommodate 0
the 0
spirit 0
of 0
our 0
“most 0
enlightened” 0
age---which 0
is, 0
of 0
course, 0
an 1
evil 1
spirit 1
that 1
can 1
be 1
driven 1
out 1
only 1
by 1
prayer 1
and 1
fasting. 1

Until 1
the 1
Church 1
and 1
her 1
bishops 1
get 1
back 1
to 1
reaffirming 1
traditional 1
Catholic 1
teaching 1
on 1
human 1
sexuality 1
we 1
can 1
forget 1
about 1
seeing 1
an 1
end 1
to 1
the 1
sexual 1
abuse 1
crisis 1
and 1
the 1
massive 1
problem 1
of 1
homosexuality 1
in 1
the 1
clergy. 1

McCarrick 0
will 0
become 0
the 0
norm, 0
not 0
the 0
exception, 0
and 0
confidence 0
in 0
the 0
leadership 0
and 0
moral 0
authority 0
of 0
the 0
Catholic 0
Church 0
will 1
remain 1
in 1
the 1
toilet 1
indefinitely... 1
exactly 0
as 0
the 1
forces 1
of 1
darkness 1
intended 0
all 0
along. 0
