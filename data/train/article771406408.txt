"One 0 290 9

one 0 290 9
of 0 290 9
the 0 290 9
killer's 0 290 9

my 0 290 9

and 0 290 9
the 0 290 9

time 0 290 9
she 0 290 9
called 0 290 9
her 0 290 9
a 0 290 9
dirty 1 290 9
Jew," 1 290 9
he 0 290 9
described. 0 290 9

Sarah’s 0 290 10
brother 0 290 10
said 0 290 10
that 0 290 10
the 0 290 10
killer 0 290 10

Sarah 0 290 10

“dirty 1 290 10
Jews”. 1 290 10

The 0 290 11
authorities 0 290 11
stonewalled 1 290 11
at 0 290 11
every 0 290 11
turn. 0 290 11

And, 0 290 12
predictably, 0 290 12
the 0 290 12
killer 0 290 12
gets 0 290 12
a 0 290 12
pass. 0 290 12

The 0 290 14
28-year-old 0 290 14

man 0 290 14
confessed 0 290 14
to 0 290 14
the 0 290 14

was 0 290 14
heard 0 290 14

“Allahu 1 290 14

and 0 290 14
calling 0 290 14
Halimi 0 290 14
“Satan” 1 290 14
shortly 0 290 14
before 0 290 14

out 0 290 14
the 0 290 14
window 0 290 14
of 0 290 14
her 0 290 14
three-story 0 290 14
apartment. 0 290 14

In 0 290 15
January, 0 290 15
Traore 0 290 15
was 0 290 15
determined 0 290 15
to 0 290 15
be 0 290 15
fit 0 290 15
to 0 290 15
stand 0 290 15
trial. 0 290 15

He 0 290 16
was 0 290 16
placed 0 290 16
in 0 290 16
a 0 290 16
psychiatric 0 290 16
hospital 0 290 16
for 0 290 16
weeks 0 290 16
after 0 290 16
his 0 290 16
arrest 0 290 16
in 0 290 16
the 0 290 16
April 0 290 16
2017 0 290 16
killing 0 290 16
despite 0 290 16
having 0 290 16
no 0 290 16
history 0 290 16
of 0 290 16
mental 0 290 16
illness. 0 290 16

But 0 290 17
a 0 290 17
judge 0 290 17
requested 0 290 17
a 0 290 17
second 0 290 17
series 0 290 17
of 0 290 17
tests, 0 290 17
which 0 290 17
determined 0 290 17
that 0 290 17
the 0 290 17
Malian 0 290 17
immigrant 0 290 17
was 0 290 17
not 0 290 17
able 0 290 17
to 0 290 17
stand 0 290 17
trial, 0 290 17
20 0 290 17
Minutes 0 290 17
reported 0 290 17
Wednesday. 0 290 17

This 0 290 18
tired 1 290 18
farce 1 290 18
has 0 290 18
dragged 0 290 18
on. 0 290 18

Kobili 0 290 19
Traore 0 290 19
was 0 290 19
hit 1 290 19
with 0 290 19
hate 0 290 19
crimes 0 290 19
charges. 0 290 19

Then 0 290 20
they 0 290 20
were 0 290 20
dropped. 0 290 20

The 1 290 21
authorities 1 290 21
allowed 1 290 21
him 1 290 21
to 1 290 21
commit 1 290 21
the 1 290 21
crime. 1 290 21

Now 0 290 22
they're 0 290 22
letting 0 290 22
him 0 290 22
get 0 290 22
away 0 290 22
with 0 290 22
it. 0 290 22

Three 0 290 23
minutes 0 290 23
later, 0 290 23
a 0 290 23
unit 0 290 23
of 0 290 23
the 0 290 23
Anti-Crime 0 290 23
Brigade 0 290 23
(BAC) 0 290 23
— 0 290 23
who 0 290 23
happened 0 290 23
to 0 290 23
be 0 290 23
patrolling 0 290 23
the 0 290 23
area 0 290 23
— 0 290 23
took 0 290 23
up 0 290 23
position 0 290 23
in 0 290 23
front 0 290 23
of 0 290 23
Diara’s 0 290 23
door. 0 290 23

They 0 290 24
heard 0 290 24
Kobili 0 290 24
Traore 0 290 24
chanting 0 290 24
Muslim 0 290 24
prayers 0 290 24
and 0 290 24
Koranic 0 290 24
verses. 0 290 24

Unsure 0 290 25
about 0 290 25
the 0 290 25
situation 0 290 25
and 0 290 25
the 0 290 25
potential 0 290 25
threats 0 290 25
to 0 290 25
the 0 290 25
family, 0 290 25
they 0 290 25
asked 0 290 25
for 0 290 25
reinforcements. 0 290 25

Additional 0 290 26
policemen 0 290 26
arrived 0 290 26
quickly. 0 290 26

However, 0 290 27
for 0 290 27
some 0 290 27
unclear 0 290 27
reason, 0 290 27
the 0 290 27
BAC 0 290 27
unit 0 290 27
still 0 290 27
refrained 0 290 27
from 0 290 27
breaking 0 290 27
in. 0 290 27

In 0 290 28
the 0 290 28
meantime, 0 290 28
Kobili 0 290 28
Traore 0 290 28
put 0 290 28
on 0 290 28
new 0 290 28
clothes 0 290 28
and 0 290 28
climbed 0 290 28
out 0 290 28
of 0 290 28
the 0 290 28
window 0 290 28
to 0 290 28
reach 0 290 28
Sarah 0 290 28
Halimi’s 0 290 28
apartment, 0 290 28
which 0 290 28
was 0 290 28
at 0 290 28
the 0 290 28
same 0 290 28
level 0 290 28
as 0 290 28
Diara 0 290 28
Traore’s. 0 290 28

He 0 290 29
allegedly 0 290 29
assaulted 0 290 29
the 0 290 29
Jewish 0 290 29
woman 0 290 29
and 0 290 29
hit 1 290 29
her 1 290 29
mercilessly. 1 290 29

From 0 290 30
time 0 290 30
to 0 290 30
time 0 290 30
he 0 290 30
resumed 0 290 30
Koranic 0 290 30
recitation. 0 290 30

Many 0 290 31
neighbours, 0 290 31
woken 0 290 31
by 0 290 31
the 0 290 31
old 0 290 31
woman’s 0 290 31
screams 0 290 31
or 0 290 31
the 0 290 31
assaulter’s 0 290 31
religious 0 290 31
chanting, 0 290 31
called 0 290 31
the 0 290 31
police 0 290 31
Some 0 290 31
gave 0 290 31
details 0 290 31
about 0 290 31
the 0 290 31
exact 0 290 31
location 0 290 31
of 0 290 31
the 0 290 31
assault, 0 290 31
the 0 290 31
attacker’s 0 290 31
identity, 0 290 31
the 0 290 31
fact 0 290 31
he 0 290 31
vilified 0 290 31
his 0 290 31
victim 0 290 31
as 0 290 31
a 0 290 31
Jewish 0 290 31
person 0 290 31
and 0 290 31
as 0 290 31
“a 1 290 31
Satan” 1 290 31
while 0 290 31
hitting 0 290 31
her, 0 290 31
or 0 290 31
even 0 290 31
— 0 290 31
as 0 290 31
far 0 290 31
as 0 290 31
the 0 290 31
Muslim 0 290 31
neighbours 0 290 31
were 0 290 31
concerned 0 290 31
— 0 290 31
the 0 290 31
Koranic 0 290 31
portions 0 290 31
he 0 290 31
chanted. 0 290 31

Yet 0 290 32
the 0 290 32
police 0 290 32
still 0 290 32
failed 0 290 32
to 0 290 32
storm 0 290 32
Sarah 0 290 32
Halimi’s 0 290 32
apartment 0 290 32
and 0 290 32
rescue 0 290 32
her. 0 290 32

Eventually, 0 290 33
Kobili 0 290 33
Traore 0 290 33
is 0 290 33
claimed 0 290 33
to 0 290 33
have 0 290 33
shouted 0 290 33
that 0 290 33
the 0 290 33
woman 0 290 33
was 0 290 33
“mad 0 290 33
and 0 290 33
about 0 290 33
to 0 290 33
commit 0 290 33
suicide”, 0 290 33
and 0 290 33
threw 0 290 33
her 0 290 33
out 0 290 33
of 0 290 33
the 0 290 33
window. 0 290 33

He 0 290 34
had 0 290 34
time 0 290 34
enough 0 290 34
to 0 290 34
climb 0 290 34
back 0 290 34
to 0 290 34
Diara 0 290 34
Traore’s 0 290 34
apartment 0 290 34
where 0 290 34
he 0 290 34
finally 0 290 34
was 0 290 34
arrested. 0 290 34

His 0 290 35
hands 0 290 35
were 0 290 35
covered 0 290 35
in 0 290 35
blood. 0 290 35

There 0 290 36
was 0 290 36
blood 0 290 36
everywhere 0 290 36
in 0 290 36
his 0 290 36
victim’s 0 290 36
apartment. 0 290 36

Sure 0 290 37
he 0 290 37
was 0 290 37
crazy. 1 290 37

So 0 290 38
crazy 0 290 38
he 0 290 38
tried 0 290 38
to 0 290 38
contrive 0 290 38
an 0 290 38
alibi 0 290 38
for 0 290 38
his 0 290 38
crime. 0 290 38

Kobili 0 290 39
isn't 0 290 39
crazy. 1 290 39

But 0 290 39

the 0 290 39

system 0 290 39

that 0 290 39

keeps 0 290 39

on 0 290 39

protecting 0 290 39

him 0 290 39

is. 0 290 39
