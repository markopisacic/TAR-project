The 0

Continues 0

While 0
the 0

was 0
announcing 0
for 0
the 0
past 0
two 0
weeks 0
that 0
President 0

was 0
going 0
to 0
release 0
the 0
CIA’s 0
long-secret 0
records 0
on 0
the 0
JFK 0
assassination, 0
I 0
took 0
a 0
different 0
position. 0

On 0
Monday 0

this 0

I 0
predicted 0
that 0
Trump 0
would 0
make 0
a 0

with 0
the 0

that 0
would 0
enable 0
the 0

of 0
the 0

assassination. 0

Donald 1

was 0

he 0
was 0

wanted 0
all 0

up 0

The 0
fact 0
is 0
that 0
the 0
CIA 0
put 0
in 0
its 0
request 0
to 0
Trump 0
for 0
continued 0
secrecy 0
of 0
its 0

long 0
before 0

But 0
“Art 1

Trump 1
obviously 1
sat 1
on 1
the 1
request, 1
undoubtedly 1
hoping 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
get 1
what 1
he 1
wanted 1
in 1
return 1
if 1
he 1
just 1
continued 1
holding 1
out 1
and 1
conveying 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
ready 1
to 1
release 1
the 1
records. 1

Don’t 0
forget: 0
According 0
to 0
Trump’s 0
own 0
tweets, 0
he 0
had 0
already 0
ostensibly 0
decided 0
to 0
deny 0
the 0
CIA’s 0
request 0
for 0
secrecy 0
before 0
the 0
Thursday 0
deadline: 0

Trump 0

sent 0

Saturday, 0
October 0
21: 0
“Subject 0

So 1
interesting! 1

Now, 0
it’s 0
theoretically 0
possible 0
that 0
the 0
CIA 0
presented 0
Trump 0
with 1
some 1
earthshattering 1
new 1
information 1
on 0
the 0
Thursday 0
deadline 0
that 0
showed 0
that 0
the 1
United 1
States 1
would 1
fall 1
into 1
the 1
ocean 1
if 1
Americans 1
were 1
finally 1
permitted 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
CIA’s 1
long-secret 1
JFK 0
records. 0

But 1
how 1
likely 1
is 1
that? 1

Not 0
likely 0
at 0
all! 0

Instead, 0
it 1
is 1
a 1
virtual 1
certainly 1
that 1
when 1
Art 1
of 1
the 1
Deal 1
Trump 1
sent 1
out 1
those 1
two 1
tweets, 1
he 1
was 1
sending 1
a 1
message 1
to 1
the 1
CIA 1
as 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
negotiations: 1
Give 1
me 1
what 1
I 1
want 1
or 1
I 1
will 1
release 1
the 1
records. 1

In 0
the 0
negotiations, 0
both 0
Trump 0
and 0
the 0
CIA 0
knew 0
that 0
Trump 0
was 0
in 0

In 0
the 0
end, 0
the 0
CIA 0
blinked, 0
just 0
as 0
Trump 0
knew 0
it 0
would. 0

Contrary 0
to 0
what 0
the 0
mainstream 0
press 0
is 0
asserting, 0
the 1
records 1
undoubtedly 1
contain 1
more 1
incriminating 1
circumstantial 1
evidence 1
that 1
fills 1
in 1
the 1
mosaic 1
of 1
a 1
U.S. 1
national-security 1
regime-change 1
operation 1
on 1
November 1
22, 1
1963. 1

That’s 0
what 0
the 0
mainstream 0
media, 0
forever 0
wedded 0
to 0
the 0
official 0
story 0
no 0
matter 0
how 0
ridiculous 1
and 1
illogical 1
it 0
is, 0
simply 0
cannot 0
bring 0
themselves 0
to 0
confront. 0

Trump 0
knew 0
that 0
he 0
had 0
the 0
CIA 0
over 0
a 0
barrel. 0

As 0
I 0
indicated 0
in 0
my 0
two 0
articles 0
this 0
week, 0
the 0
CIA 0
was 0
between 0
a 0
rock 0
and 0
a 0
hard 0
place. 0

On 0
the 0
one 0
hand, 0
it 0
could 0
refuse 0
to 0
grant 0
Trump 0
what 0
he 0
wanted 0
and 0
let 0
the 0
records 0
be 0
released, 0
which 0
it 1
knew 1
would 1
point 1
to 1
the 1
CIA’s 1
guilt 1
in 1
the 1
assassination. 1

On 0
the 0
other 0
hand, 0
it 0
could 0
give 0
Trump 0
what 0
he 0
wanted 0
and 0
have 0
to 0
suffer 0
the 1
obvious 1
inference 1
that 1
people 1
would 1
draw 1
— 1
that 1
the 1
CIA 1
was 1
continuing 1
to 1
cover 1
up 1
incriminatory 1
evidence. 1

What 0
did 0
the 0
CIA 0
give 0
Trump 0
in 0
return 0
for 0
Trump’s 0
extending 0
the 0
CIA’s 0
50-year-plus 0
secrecy? 0

We 0
don’t 0
know, 0
but 0
my 0
hunch 0
is 0
that 0
it 0
pertains 0
to 0
Russia. 0

Here’s 0
my 0
next 0
prediction: 0
the 0
congressional 0
investigations 0
into 0
Trump’s 0
supposed 0
“collusion” 0
with 0
Russia 0
are 0
about 0
to 0
fizzle 0
out. 0

That’s 0
because 0
I 0
believe 0
that 0
the 0
CIA, 0
as 0
part 0
of 0
its 0
deal 0
with 0
Trump, 0
will 0
order 0
its 0
assets 0
in 0
Congress 0
to 0
cease 0
and 0
desist 0
with 0
respect 0
to 0
that 0
investigation. 0

In 0
my 0
opinion, 0
that’s 0
the 0
price 0
the 0
CIA 0
had 0
to 0
pay 0
in 0
return 0
for 0
its 0
continued 0
cover-up 0
of 0
its 0
U.S. 0
regime-change 0
operation 0
in 0
November 0
1963. 0

Notice 0
something 0
else 0
about 0
the 0
deal 0
that 0
Trump 0
has 0
presumably 0
made 0
with 0
the 0
CIA: 0
The 0
secrecy 0
arrangement 0
extends 0
only 0
to 0
April. 0

Ostensibly, 0
the 0
next 0
six 0
months 0
are 0
needed 0
to 0
carefully 0
review 0
the 0
records 0
to 0
determine 0
whether 0
the 0
records 0
really 0
to 0
relate 0
to 0
“national 0
security.” 0

Not 0
surprisingly, 0
the 0
mainstream 0
media 0
isn’t 1
even 1
questioning 1
that 1
ludicrous 1
notion. 1

For 0
more 0
than 0
50 0
years, 0
the 0
CIA 0
has 0
known 0
why 0
it 0
has 0
wanted 0
those 0
particular 0
records 0
to 0
be 0
kept 0
secret. 0

During 0
the 0
term 0
of 0
the 0
Assassination 0
Records 0
Review 0
Board 0
in 0
the 0
1990s, 0
the 0
CIA 0
decided 0
to 0
keep 0
these 0
particular 0
records 0
secret 0
for 0
another 0
25 0
years. 0

There 0
are 0
bound 0
to 0
be 0
lots 0
of 0
CIA 0
memoranda 0
detailing 0
why 0
it 0
was 0
imperative 0
to 0
keep 0
these 0
particular 0
records 0
secret 0
for 0
as 0
long 0
as 0
possible. 0

Finally, 0
the 0
CIA 0
made 0
its 0
request 0
for 0
secrecy 0
to 0
Trump 0
at 0
least 0
several 0
weeks 0
ago. 0

The 0
notion 0
that 0
the 0
CIA 0
suddenly 0
hit 0
Trump 0
yesterday 0
with 0
a 0
new 0
argument 0
as 0
to 0
why 0
“national 0
security” 0
would 0
be 0
threatened, 0
after 0
Trump 0
had 0
supposedly 0
already 0
rejected 0
the 0
arguments 0
that 0
had 0
been 0
presented 0
to 0
him, 0
causing 0
Trump 0
to 0
suddenly 0
change 0
his 0
mind, 0
is, 1
well, 1
laughable. 1

So, 0
why 0
the 0
April 0
deadline? 0

Why 0
not 0
extend 0
the 0
secrecy 0
for 0
another 0
25 0
years, 0
which 0
is 0
undoubtedly 0
what 0
the 0
CIA 0
wanted? 0

Because 0
Trump 0
obviously 0
needed 0
collateral 0
to 0
ensure 0
that 0
the 0
CIA 0
complied 0
with 0
its 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
deal. 0

If 0
Trump 0
had 0
extended 0
the 0
secrecy 0
for 0
25 0
years, 0
he 0
would 0
have 0
lost 0
leverage 0
to 0
ensure 0
that 0
the 0
CIA 0
complied 0
with 0
its 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
bargain. 0

Let’s 0
say, 0
hypothetically, 0
that 0
I’m 0
right: 0
that 0
the 0
CIA 0
agreed 0
to 0
use 0
its 0
assets 0
in 0
Congress 0
to 0
shut 0
down 0
the 0
Russia 0
investigation. 0

To 0
make 0
certain 0
that 0
the 0
CIA 0
fulfills 0
its 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
bargain, 0
Trump 0
would 0
need 0
the 0
April 0
deadline 0
so 0
that 0
the 0
threat 0
of 0
the 0
records 0
release 0
would 0
continue 0
hanging 0
over 0
the 0
CIA. 0

If 0
the 0
CIA 0
fails 0
to 0
fulfill 0
its 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
bargain, 0
Trump 0
releases 0
the 0
records 0
in 0
April. 0

If 0
the 0
CIA 0
squelches 0
the 0
Russia 0
investigations, 0
Trump 0
grants 0
another 0
extension 0
of 0
time 0
in 0
April. 0

Let’s 1
state 1
the 1
obvious: 1
The 1
CIA 1
records 1
that 1
are 1
still 1
being 1
suppressed 1
have 1
nothing 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
“national 1
security.” 1
They 1
have 1
everything 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
covering 1
up 1
the 1
CIA’s 1
role 1
in 0
the 0
U.S. 0
national-security 0
regime-change 0
operation 0
that 0
took 0
place 0
in 0
Dallas 0
in 0
November 0
1963, 0
which 0
succeeded 0
in 0
ousting 0
from 0
power 0
a 0
president 0
who 0
was, 0
in 0
the 0

that 0
constituted 0
a 1
grave 1
threat 1
to 1
“national 1
security,” 1
i.e., 1
befriending 1
the 1
Russians 1
(i.e., 1
the 1
Soviets) 1
and 1
Cubans 1
and 1
entering 1
into 1
peaceful 1
coexistence 1
with 1
the 1
communist 1
world. 1

In 0
other 0
words, 0
unlike 0
Lee 0
Harvey 0
Oswald, 0
who 1
had 1
absolutely 1
no 1
motive 1
to 1
kill 1
President 1
Kennedy, 1
the 0
national 0
security 0
establishment 0
did 0
have 0
motive, 0
a 0
powerful 0
motive, 0
the 1
same 1
motive 1
that 1
motivated 1
the 1
CIA 1
and 1
Pentagon 1
to 1
target 1
other 1
political 1
leaders 1
for 1
regime 1

around 1
that 1

admired), 1

Immediately 0
upon 0
the 0
arrest 0
of 0
Lee 0
Harvey 0
Oswald, 0
the 0
official 0
account 0
was 0
that 0
this 0
was 0
just 0
a 1
lone 1
nut, 1
former 1
U.S. 1
Marine 1
communist 1
who 0
decided, 0
for 0
no 0
apparent 0
reason, 0
to 0
assassinate 0
Kennedy. 0

One 0
big 0
problem 0
is 0
the 0
official 0
story, 0
however, 0
requires 0
a 0
suspension 1
of 1
logic 1
and 1
common 1
sense. 1

For 0
anyone 0
who 0
has 0
a 0
mindset 0
of 0
conformity 0
and 0
deference 0
to 0
authority, 0
that 0
story 0
makes 0
sense 0
because 0
nothing 0
is 0
questioned 0
or 0
challenged. 0

For 1
anyone 1
who 1
has 1
a 1
critical, 1
analytical, 1
independent 1
mindset, 1
the 1
official 1
story 1
is 1
filled 1
with 1
holes. 1

For 0
example, 0
how 0
many 0
communist 0
Marines 0
have 0
you 0
ever 0
heard 0
of? 0

Why 0
would 0
a 0
genuine 0
communist 0
join 0
the 0
Marines 0
in 0
the 0
first 0
place, 0
especially 0
since 0
the 0
Marines 0
had 0
just 0
recently 0
killed 0
millions 0
of 0
North 0
Korean 0
communists? 0

Why 0
would 0
a 0
genuine 0
communist 0
join 0
the 0
Marines 0
knowing 0
that 0
he 0
could 0
be 0
called 0
upon 0
at 0
any 0
moment 0

go 0

Soon 0
after 0
the 0
Warren 0
Commission 0
was 0
established, 0
Warren 0
called 0
a 0
super-secret 0
meeting 0
of 0
the 0
commission 0
to 0
address 0
information 0
that 0
had 0
come 0
into 0
Warren’s 0
possession. 0

That 0
information 0
was 0
that 0
Oswald 0
was 0
actually 0
working 0
for 0
U.S. 0
intelligence. 0

Yes, 0
a 0
spy, 0
the 0
type 0
of 0
people 0
that 0
work 0
for 0
the 0
CIA. 0

That 0
would 0
make 0
sense, 0
especially 0
given 0
that 0
the 0
Marine 0
Corps 0
is 0
a 0
prime 0
recruiting 0
place 0
for 0
the 0
CIA. 0

Semper 0
fidelis! 0

Now, 0
suddenly, 0
all 0
the 0
circumstantial 0
evidence 0
in 0
the 0
Kennedy 0
assassination 0
falls 0
into 0
place. 0

It 0
begins 0
to 0
make 0
sense. 0

The 0
mosaic 0
starts 0
to 0
be 0
filled 0
out: 0
They 1
needed 1
to 1
get 1
rid 1
of 1
Kennedy 1
to 1
protect 1
national 1
security 1
and 1
elevate 1
Johnson, 1
who 1
had 1
the 1
same 1
anti-communist 1
mindset 1
as 1
the 1
Pentagon 1
and 1
the 1
CIA, 1
to 1
the 1
presidency. 1

Unlike 0
JFK, 0
who 0
had 0
begun 0
withdrawing 0
troops 0
from 0
Vietnam, 0
Johnson 0
would 0
The 0

for 0

protect 0
national 0
security 0
by 0
sending 0
more 0
troops 0
to 0
Vietnam. 0

But 0
to 0
avoid 0
detection, 0
they 0
needed 0
a 0
patsy, 0
which 0
is 0
the 0
term 0
that 0
Oswald 0
used 0
after 0
his 0
arrest. 0

They 0
needed 0
to 0
frame 0
someone 0
for 0
the 0
crime. 0

And 0
what 0
better 0
person 0
to 0
frame 0
than 0
a 0
communist 0
or 0
an 0
intelligence 0
agent 0
who 0
the 0
public 0
would 0
believe 0
was 0
a 0
communist? 0

Part 0
of 0
the 0
scheme, 0
obviously, 0
would 0
be 0
to 0
establish 0
Oswald’s 0
communist 0
bona 0
fides. 0

That’s 0
why 0
he 0
was 0
sent 0
to 0
New 0
Orleans, 0
where, 0
contradictorily, 0
he 0
would 0
work 0
for 0
a 0
right-wing 0
business 0
owner, 0
work 0
with 0
a 0
right-wing 0
former 0
FBI 0
agent, 0
and 0
conduct 0
a 0
public 0
protest 0
in 0
favor 0
of 0
Fidel 0
Castro 0
and 0
Cuba. 0

It 0
was 0
also 0
why 0
he 0
was 0
sent 0
to 0
Mexico 0
City, 0
where 0
he 0
would 0
be 0
ordered 0
to 0
visit 0
the 0
Cuban 0
and 0
Soviet 0
Embassies, 0
no 1
doubt 1
being 1
told 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
being 1
prepared 1
for 1
an 1
important 1
mission, 1
maybe 0
to 0
enter 0
Cuba 0
to 0
assassinate 0
Castro. 0

But 0
no 1
government 1
operation 1
ever 1
goes 1
perfectly. 1

Things 0
obviously 0
went 0
dreadfully 1
wrong 1
with 0
the 0
Mexico 0
City 0
operation 0
because 0
the 0
investigation 0
into 0
it 0
after 0
the 0
assassination 0
was 0
quickly 0
shut 0
down. 0

Today, 0
it 0
remains 0
shrouded 1
in 1
mystery. 1

And 0
guess 0
what 0
is 0
included 0
in 0
the 0
records 0
that 0
Trump 0
has 0
now 0
agreed 0
to 0
continue 0
suppressing. 0

You 0
guessed 0
it! 0

The 0
CIA’s 0
records 0
relating 0
to 0
Mexico 0
City! 0

Ever 0
since 0
the 0
assassination, 0
the 1
CIA 1
has 1
argued 1
that 1
the 1
release 1
of 1
any 1
of 1
its 1
JFK 1
records 1
would 1
threaten 1
“national 1
security.” 1
One 0
thing 0
is 0
for 0
sure 0
and 0
undeniable: 0
Despite 0
the 0
release 0
of 0
many 0
of 0
the 0
CIA’s 0
records 0
in 0
the 0
1990s 0
and 0
yesterday, 0
the 1
United 1
States 1
did 1
not 1
fall 1
into 1
the 1
ocean 1
or 1
fall 1
to 1
the 1
communists. 1

And 0
neither 0
would 0
it 0
have 0
done 0
so 0
if 0
Trump 0
had 0
not 0
granted 0
the 0
CIA’s 0
request 0
for 0
a 0
continued 0
cover-up 0
of 0
what 0
it 0
did 0
on 0
November 0
22, 0
1963. 0
