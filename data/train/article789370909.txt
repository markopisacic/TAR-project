by 0 85 4
Ronan 0 85 4

The 0 85 5
article 0 85 5
recounted 0 85 5
a 0 85 5
claim 0 85 5
by 0 85 5
Deborah 0 85 5
Ramirez, 0 85 5
a 0 85 5
Yale 0 85 5
classmate 0 85 5
of 0 85 5
Brett 0 85 5
Kavanaugh’s, 0 85 5
concerning 0 85 5
“a 0 85 5
dormitory 0 85 5
party 0 85 5
gone 0 85 5
awry.” 0 85 5
As 0 85 5
the 0 85 5
article 0 85 5
acknowledged, 0 85 5
however, 0 85 5
“her 0 85 5
memories 0 85 5
contained 0 85 5
gaps 0 85 5
because 0 85 5
she 0 85 5
had 0 85 5
been 0 85 5
drinking 0 85 5
at 0 85 5
the 0 85 5
time 0 85 5
of 0 85 5
the 0 85 5
alleged 0 85 5
incident.” 0 85 5
The 0 85 5
article 0 85 5
goes 0 85 5
on 0 85 5
to 0 85 5
say 0 85 5
that 0 85 5
in 0 85 5
her 0 85 5
initial 0 85 5
conversations 0 85 5
with 0 85 5
The 0 85 5
New 0 85 5
Yorker, 0 85 5
Ms. 0 85 5
Ramirez 0 85 5
was 0 85 5
“reluctant 0 85 5
to 0 85 5
characterize 0 85 5
Kavanaugh’s 0 85 5
role 0 85 5
in 0 85 5
the 0 85 5
alleged 0 85 5
incident 0 85 5
with 0 85 5
certainty.” 0 85 5
It 0 85 5
was 0 85 5
only 0 85 5
after 0 85 5
“six 0 85 5
days 0 85 5
of 0 85 5
carefully 0 85 5
assessing 0 85 5
her 0 85 5
memories 0 85 5
and 0 85 5
consulting 0 85 5
with 0 85 5
her 0 85 5
attorney” 0 85 5
that 0 85 5
Ms. 0 85 5
Ramirez 0 85 5
was 0 85 5
suddenly 0 85 5
able 0 85 5
to 0 85 5
pinpoint 0 85 5
Judge 0 85 5
Kavanaugh 0 85 5
as 0 85 5
having 0 85 5
committed 0 85 5
an 0 85 5
unsavory 0 85 5
act, 0 85 5
even 0 85 5
though 0 85 5
she 0 85 5
admitted 0 85 5
being 0 85 5
“foggy” 0 85 5
at 0 85 5
the 0 85 5
time. 0 85 5

The 0 85 6
New 0 85 6
Yorker 0 85 6
article 0 85 6
also 0 85 6
noted 0 85 6
that 0 85 6
the 0 85 6
magazine 0 85 6
“has 0 85 6
not 0 85 6
confirmed 0 85 6
with 0 85 6
other 0 85 6
eyewitnesses 0 85 6
that 0 85 6
Kavanaugh 0 85 6
was 0 85 6
present 0 85 6
at 0 85 6
the 0 85 6
party.” 0 85 6

Meanwhile, 0 85 7
the 0 85 7
ever-present 0 85 7
Michael 0 85 7
Avenatti, 0 85 7
attorney 0 85 7
of 0 85 7
porn 0 85 7
star 0 85 7
Stormy 0 85 7
Daniels, 0 85 7
tweeted 0 85 7
that 0 85 7
he 0 85 7
had 0 85 7
information 0 85 7
from 0 85 7
anonymous 0 85 7
sources 0 85 7
that 0 85 7
Judge 0 85 7
Kavanaugh 0 85 7
and 0 85 7
his 0 85 7
friend 0 85 7
had 0 85 7
"targeted" 0 85 7
women 0 85 7
with 0 85 7
drugs 0 85 7
and 0 85 7
alcohol 0 85 7
at 0 85 7
parties 0 85 7
to 0 85 7
facilitate 0 85 7
"gang 0 85 7
rape." 0 85 7

Haters 1 85 8
of 1 85 8
Judge 1 85 8
Kavanaugh 1 85 8
are 0 85 8
turning 0 85 8
the 0 85 8
process 0 85 8
of 0 85 8
Senate 0 85 8
confirmation 0 85 8
of 0 85 8
a 0 85 8
Supreme 0 85 8
Court 0 85 8
nominee 0 85 8
into 0 85 8
something 0 85 8
worse 1 85 8
than 1 85 8
a 1 85 8
travesty. 1 85 8

His 0 85 9
opponents 0 85 9
in 0 85 9
the 0 85 9
Senate 0 85 9
have 0 85 9
transformed 0 85 9
their 0 85 9
“advise 0 85 9
and 0 85 9
consent” 0 85 9
function 0 85 9
into 0 85 9
a 0 85 9
campaign 0 85 9
of 0 85 9
no-holds 0 85 9
barred 0 85 9
character 1 85 9
assassination. 1 85 9

on 0 85 10

assuming 0 85 10
that 0 85 10

Her 0 85 11

stalled 0 85 11
for 0 85 11
a 0 85 11
week 0 85 11
before 0 85 11

Among 0 85 12
the 0 85 12
issues 0 85 12
Ms. 0 85 12
Ford’s 0 85 12
attorneys 0 85 12
have 0 85 12
raised 0 85 12

the 0 85 12
refusal 0 85 12
of 0 85 12
the 0 85 12

who 0 85 12
Ms. 0 85 12
Ford 0 85 12
reportedly 0 85 12
claims 0 85 12
was 0 85 12
involved 0 85 12
in 0 85 12
the 0 85 12
alleged 0 85 12
incident, 0 85 12
as 0 85 12
well 0 85 12
as 0 85 12
“who 0 85 12
on 0 85 12
the 0 85 12

A 0 85 13
week 0 85 13
has 0 85 13
already 0 85 13
gone 0 85 13
by 0 85 13
since 0 85 13
Ms. 0 85 13
Ford 0 85 13
went 0 85 13
public 0 85 13
with 0 85 13
her 0 85 13

Ms. 0 85 13

her 0 85 13
attorneys 0 85 13
stalled 0 85 13
for 0 85 13
time. 0 85 13

They 0 85 14
raised 0 85 14
one 0 85 14
procedural 0 85 14
issue 0 85 14
after 0 85 14
another 0 85 14
while 0 85 14
claiming 0 85 14
that 0 85 14
the 0 85 14
committee 0 85 14
majority 0 85 14
was 0 85 14
“bullying” 0 85 14

Committee 0 85 15
Chairman 0 85 15
Charles 0 85 15
Grassley 0 85 15
(R-I) 0 85 15
has 0 85 15
bent 1 85 15
over 1 85 15
backwards 1 85 15
to 0 85 15
accommodate 0 85 15
Ms. 0 85 15
Ford’s 0 85 15
preferred 0 85 15
scheduling 0 85 15
for 0 85 15
her 0 85 15
appearance. 0 85 15

He 0 85 16
extended 0 85 16
the 0 85 16
deadline 0 85 16
several 0 85 16
times 0 85 16
for 0 85 16
her 0 85 16
to 0 85 16
come 0 85 16
to 0 85 16
a 0 85 16
decision 0 85 16
on 0 85 16
whether 0 85 16
to 0 85 16
testify 0 85 16
at 0 85 16
all. 0 85 16

He 0 85 17
had 0 85 17
offered 0 85 17
various 0 85 17
options 0 85 17
for 0 85 17
her 0 85 17
to 0 85 17
testify 0 85 17
publicly 0 85 17
or 0 85 17
privately 0 85 17
or 0 85 17
to 0 85 17

in 0 85 17
her 0 85 17
home 0 85 17
state 0 85 17
of 0 85 17
California, 0 85 17
whichever 0 85 17
setting 0 85 17
would 0 85 17
make 0 85 17
her 0 85 17
more 0 85 17
comfortable. 0 85 17

However, 0 85 18
in 0 85 18
Senator 0 85 18
Grassley’s 0 85 18
e-mail 0 85 18
thanking 0 85 18
Ms. 0 85 18
Ford 0 85 18
for 0 85 18
finally 0 85 18
agreeing 0 85 18
to 0 85 18
a 0 85 18
time 0 85 18
certain 0 85 18
for 0 85 18
her 0 85 18
testimony, 0 85 18
Senator 0 85 18
Grassley 0 85 18
correctly 0 85 18
reminded 0 85 18
her 0 85 18
attorneys 0 85 18
that 0 85 18
“the 0 85 18
committee 0 85 18
determines 0 85 18
which 0 85 18
witnesses 0 85 18
to 0 85 18
call, 0 85 18
how 0 85 18
many 0 85 18
witnesses 0 85 18
to 0 85 18
call, 0 85 18
and 0 85 18
what 0 85 18
order 0 85 18
to 0 85 18
call 0 85 18
them 0 85 18
and 0 85 18
who 0 85 18
will 0 85 18
question 0 85 18
them. 0 85 18

These 0 85 19
are 0 85 19
nonnegotiable.” 0 85 19

While 0 85 20
the 0 85 20
negotiations 0 85 20
with 0 85 20
Ms. 0 85 20
Ford’s 0 85 20
attorneys 0 85 20
for 0 85 20
her 0 85 20
testimony 0 85 20
were 0 85 20
underway, 0 85 20
Democrats 0 85 20
were 0 85 20
sitting 0 85 20
on 0 85 20
the 0 85 20
latest 0 85 20
allegations, 0 85 20
ready 1 85 20
to 1 85 20
pounce 1 85 20
as 0 85 20
soon 0 85 20
as 0 85 20
Ms. 0 85 20
Ford’s 0 85 20
accusation 0 85 20
was 0 85 20
about 0 85 20
to 0 85 20
be 0 85 20
heard. 0 85 20

Some 0 85 21
Democrats 0 85 21
are 0 85 21
already 0 85 21
using 0 85 21
the 0 85 21
Ramirez 0 85 21
episode 0 85 21
to 0 85 21
push 0 85 21
anew 0 85 21
for 0 85 21
a 0 85 21
fresh 0 85 21
FBI 0 85 21
investigation 0 85 21
and 0 85 21
to 0 85 21
postpone 0 85 21
Thursday’s 0 85 21
scheduled 0 85 21
hearing. 0 85 21

Ideally, 0 85 22
if 0 85 22
the 0 85 22
Democrats 0 85 22
cannot 0 85 22
apply 0 85 22
enough 0 85 22
pressure 0 85 22
to 0 85 22
force 0 85 22
a 0 85 22
withdrawal 0 85 22
of 0 85 22
Judge 0 85 22
Kavanaugh’s 0 85 22
nomination 0 85 22
through 0 85 22
their 0 85 22
relentless 0 85 22
campaign 0 85 22
of 0 85 22
character 1 85 22
assassination, 1 85 22
they 0 85 22
want 0 85 22
to 0 85 22
push 0 85 22
any 0 85 22
Senate 0 85 22
votes 0 85 22
until 0 85 22
after 0 85 22
the 0 85 22
midterm 0 85 22
elections 0 85 22
at 0 85 22
the 0 85 22
earliest. 0 85 22

Then 0 85 23
they 0 85 23
will 0 85 23
claim 0 85 23
that 0 85 23
the 0 85 23
newly 0 85 23
elected 0 85 23
senators 0 85 23
should 0 85 23
be 0 85 23
involved 0 85 23
in 0 85 23
the 0 85 23
confirmation 0 85 23
decision. 0 85 23

In 0 85 24
the 0 85 24
meantime, 0 85 24
Judge 0 85 24
Kavanaugh’s 0 85 24
adversaries 0 85 24
in 0 85 24
the 0 85 24
Senate, 0 85 24
the 0 85 24
mainstream 0 85 24
media 0 85 24
and 0 85 24
progressive 0 85 24

continue 1 85 24
to 1 85 24

in 0 85 24
the 0 85 24

All 0 85 25
of 0 85 25

to 1 85 30

the 1 85 30
credibility 1 85 30

Ms. 0 85 31
Ford 0 85 31

Whatever 1 85 32
corroboration 1 85 32
Ms. 1 85 32
Ford 1 85 32
was 1 85 32
hoping 1 85 32

from 1 85 32

the 1 85 32
alleged 1 85 32
party 1 85 32
is 1 85 32
non-existent. 1 85 32

The 0 85 33
individuals 0 85 33
she 0 85 33
reportedly 0 85 33
named 0 85 33
in 0 85 33

She 0 85 34
does 0 85 34

for 0 85 34
example, 0 85 34
where 0 85 34
it 0 85 34
happened, 0 85 34
how 0 85 34
the 0 85 34
party 0 85 34
came 0 85 34
together 0 85 34
in 0 85 34

incident. 0 85 34

She 0 85 35
believes 0 85 35
the 0 85 35
alleged 0 85 35
incident 0 85 35
occurred 0 85 35
during 0 85 35
the 0 85 35
summer 0 85 35
of 0 85 35
1982, 0 85 35
but 0 85 35
reportedly 0 85 35
could 0 85 35
not 0 85 35
be 0 85 35
more 0 85 35
precise 0 85 35
on 0 85 35
the 0 85 35
day 0 85 35
or 0 85 35
even 0 85 35
the 0 85 35
month 0 85 35
of 0 85 35
the 0 85 35

Afraid 0 85 36
that 0 85 36
Ms. 0 85 36
Ford’s 0 85 36
sexual 0 85 36
assault 0 85 36
allegation 0 85 36
could 0 85 36
be 0 85 36
readily 0 85 36
challenged 0 85 36
and 0 85 36
anxious 0 85 36
to 0 85 36

some 0 85 36
sort 0 85 36
of 0 85 36
pattern 0 85 36
of 0 85 36
sexual 0 85 36
misconduct 0 85 36

this 0 85 36
single 0 85 36
alleged 0 85 36
incident, 0 85 36
the 1 85 36
Kavanaugh 1 85 36
haters 1 85 36
have 0 85 36
latched 0 85 36
onto 0 85 36
Ms. 0 85 36

story. 0 85 36

The 0 85 37
New 0 85 37
York 0 85 37
Times 0 85 37
published 0 85 37
an 0 85 37
op-ed 0 85 37
column 0 85 37
last 0 85 37
week 0 85 37
by 0 85 37
a 0 85 37
psychiatrist, 0 85 37
Richard 0 85 37
A. 0 85 37
Friedman, 0 85 37
who 0 85 37
cited 0 85 37
neurological 0 85 37
science 0 85 37
to 0 85 37
conclude 0 85 37
that 0 85 37
Ms. 0 85 37
Ford’s 0 85 37
claim 0 85 37
that 0 85 37
she 0 85 37
has 0 85 37
“a 0 85 37
vivid 0 85 37
memory 0 85 37
of 0 85 37
an 0 85 37
attack 0 85 37
that 0 85 37
took 0 85 37
place 0 85 37
when 0 85 37
she 0 85 37
was 0 85 37
15” 0 85 37
is 0 85 37
“credible.” 0 85 37
The 0 85 37
reason, 0 85 37
he 0 85 37
wrote, 0 85 37
is 0 85 37
that 0 85 37
“memories 0 85 37
formed 0 85 37
under 0 85 37
the 0 85 37
influence 0 85 37
of 0 85 37
intense 0 85 37
emotion 0 85 37
— 0 85 37
such 0 85 37
as 0 85 37
the 0 85 37
feelings 0 85 37
that 0 85 37
accompany 0 85 37
a 0 85 37
sexual 0 85 37
assault 0 85 37
— 0 85 37
are 0 85 37
indelible 0 85 37
in 0 85 37
the 0 85 37
way 0 85 37
that 0 85 37
memories 0 85 37
of 0 85 37
a 0 85 37
routine 0 85 37
day 0 85 37
are 0 85 37
not.” 0 85 37
The 1 85 37
only 1 85 37
problem 1 85 37
with 1 85 37
Dr. 1 85 37
Friedman’s 1 85 37
thesis 1 85 37
is 1 85 37
that 1 85 37
Ms. 1 85 37
Ford 1 85 37
has 1 85 37
apparently 1 85 37
forgotten 1 85 37
such 1 85 37
key 1 85 37
details 1 85 37
surrounding 1 85 37
the 1 85 37
alleged 1 85 37
sexual 1 85 37
assault 1 85 37
as 1 85 37
when 1 85 37
and 1 85 37
where 1 85 37
it 1 85 37
happened 1 85 37
and 1 85 37
how 1 85 37
she 1 85 37
got 1 85 37
home. 1 85 37

Moreover, 0 85 38
when 0 85 38
Ms. 0 85 38
Ford 0 85 38
finally 0 85 38
told 0 85 38
someone 0 85 38
about 0 85 38
the 0 85 38
incident 0 85 38
in 0 85 38
any 0 85 38
detail 0 85 38

30 0 85 38
years 0 85 38
later 0 85 38
in 0 85 38
2012, 0 85 38
during 0 85 38
a 0 85 38
couples 0 85 38
therapy 0 85 38
session 0 85 38
with 0 85 38
her 0 85 38
husband, 0 85 38
she 0 85 38
did 0 85 38
not 0 85 38
name 0 85 38
Judge 0 85 38
Kavanaugh 0 85 38
specifically, 0 85 38
according 0 85 38
to 0 85 38
the 0 85 38
therapist’s 0 85 38
notes 0 85 38
that 0 85 38
Ms. 0 85 38
Ford 0 85 38
had 0 85 38

to 0 85 38
the 0 85 38
Washington 0 85 38

The 0 85 39
Washington 0 85 39

reported 0 85 39
that 0 85 39

“do 0 85 39
not 0 85 39

she 0 85 39
reported 0 85 39
that 0 85 39

‘from 0 85 39

elitist 1 85 39

on 0 85 39
to 0 85 39

in 0 85 39
Washington.’” 0 85 39

Ms. 0 85 40
Ramirez’s 0 85 40
story 0 85 40
is 0 85 40
even 0 85 40
less 0 85 40
credible. 0 85 40

It 0 85 41
took 0 85 41
an 0 85 41
attorney 0 85 41
and 0 85 41
six 0 85 41
days 0 85 41
of 0 85 41
very 0 85 41
belated 0 85 41
reflection 0 85 41
to 0 85 41
help 0 85 41
revive 0 85 41
her 0 85 41
memory 0 85 41
of 0 85 41
an 0 85 41
incident 0 85 41
she 0 85 41
claimed 0 85 41
happened 0 85 41
while 0 85 41
she 0 85 41
herself 0 85 41
was 0 85 41
very 0 85 41
drunk. 0 85 41

Senator 0 85 42
Mazie 0 85 42
Hirono 0 85 42
(D-Hawaii), 0 85 42
one 0 85 42
of 0 85 42
Judge 0 85 42
Kavanaugh’s 0 85 42
fiercest 0 85 42
critics 0 85 42
who 0 85 42
told 0 85 42
men 0 85 42
to 0 85 42
“shut 0 85 42
up” 0 85 42
regarding 0 85 42
Ms. 0 85 42
Ford’s 0 85 42
allegations, 0 85 42
said 0 85 42
she 1 85 42
doubts 1 85 42
Judge 1 85 42
Kavanaugh’s 1 85 42
credibility 1 85 42
because 1 85 42
of 1 85 42
“how 1 85 42
he 1 85 42
approaches 1 85 42
his 1 85 42
cases.” 1 85 42
Aside 0 85 42
from 0 85 42
mischaracterizing 0 85 42
the 0 85 42
constitutional 0 85 42
textualist 0 85 42
reasoning 0 85 42
underlying 0 85 42
Judge 0 85 42
Kavanaugh’s 0 85 42
opinions, 0 85 42
she 0 85 42
is 0 85 42
saying 0 85 42
that 0 85 42
she 0 85 42
does 0 85 42
not 0 85 42
believe 0 85 42
Judge 0 85 42
Kavanaugh’s 0 85 42
denial 0 85 42
of 0 85 42
the 0 85 42
sexual 0 85 42
misconduct 0 85 42
allegations 0 85 42
lodged 0 85 42
against 0 85 42
him 0 85 42
because 0 85 42
of 0 85 42
the 0 85 42
opinions 0 85 42
he 0 85 42
wrote 0 85 42
that 0 85 42
she 0 85 42
does 0 85 42
not 0 85 42
like. 0 85 42

Such 0 85 43
circular 0 85 43
“reasoning” 0 85 43
would 0 85 43
be 0 85 43
amusing 0 85 43
if 0 85 43
it 0 85 43
were 0 85 43
not 0 85 43
so 0 85 43
emblematic 0 85 43
of 0 85 43
what 0 85 43
one 0 85 43
writer 0 85 43
called 0 85 43
“Kavanaugh 1 85 43
Derangement 1 85 43
Syndrome." 1 85 43

Senator 0 85 44

also 0 85 44
suffering 0 85 44
from 0 85 44
the 0 85 44
same 0 85 44
syndrome. 0 85 44

She 0 85 45
said 0 85 45
Thursday 0 85 45
regarding 0 85 45
Ms. 0 85 45
Ford: 0 85 45
"I 0 85 45

her 1 85 45

telling 1 85 45
the 1 85 45
truth 1 85 45

exploiting 0 85 46
the 0 85 46
“Me 1 85 46
Too” 1 85 46
movement 1 85 46
to 0 85 46
declare 0 85 46
Judge 0 85 46
Kavanaugh 0 85 46
guilty 0 85 46
simply 1 85 46
because 1 85 46
Ms. 1 85 46
Ford 1 85 46
is 1 85 46
a 1 85 46
woman 1 85 46
who 1 85 46
has 1 85 46
made 1 85 46
what 1 85 46
they 1 85 46
call, 1 85 46
without 1 85 46
any 1 85 46
corroborating 1 85 46
evidence 1 85 46
to 1 85 46
date, 1 85 46
a 1 85 46
“credible” 1 85 46
charge. 1 85 46

The 0 85 47
same 0 85 47
would 0 85 47
presumably 0 85 47
be 0 85 47
the 0 85 47
case 0 85 47
for 0 85 47
Ms. 0 85 47
Ramirez. 0 85 47

They 0 85 48
argue 0 85 48
that 0 85 48
since 0 85 48
the 0 85 48
Senate 0 85 48
Judiciary 0 85 48
Committee 0 85 48
is 0 85 48
not 0 85 48
a 0 85 48
criminal 0 85 48
judicial 0 85 48
trial, 0 85 48
but 0 85 48
rather 0 85 48
a 0 85 48
legislative 0 85 48
hearing 0 85 48
for 0 85 48
confirmation 0 85 48
of 0 85 48
a 0 85 48
Supreme 0 85 48
Court 0 85 48
nominee, 0 85 48
the 0 85 48
normal 0 85 48
burden 0 85 48
of 0 85 48
proof 0 85 48
shouldered 0 85 48
by 0 85 48
the 0 85 48
accuser 0 85 48
should 0 85 48
not 0 85 48
apply. 0 85 48

Judge 0 85 49
Kavanaugh 0 85 49
should 0 85 49
have 0 85 49
to 0 85 49
prove 0 85 49
that 0 85 49
he 0 85 49
is 0 85 49
not 0 85 49
guilty, 0 85 49
they 0 85 49
are 0 85 49
in 0 85 49
effect 0 85 49
insisting. 0 85 49

This 0 85 50
is 0 85 50
another 0 85 50
case 0 85 50
of 0 85 50
Kavanaugh 1 85 50
Derangement 1 85 50
Syndrome. 1 85 50

Let’s 0 85 51
assume 0 85 51
for 0 85 51
the 0 85 51
sake 0 85 51
of 0 85 51
argument 0 85 51
that 0 85 51
the 0 85 51
normal 0 85 51
burden 0 85 51
on 0 85 51
the 0 85 51
prosecution 0 85 51
in 0 85 51
a 0 85 51
criminal 0 85 51
case 0 85 51
- 0 85 51
to 0 85 51
prove 0 85 51
the 0 85 51
accused’s 0 85 51
guilt 0 85 51
beyond 0 85 51
a 0 85 51
reasonable 0 85 51
doubt 0 85 51
- 0 85 51
is 0 85 51
not 0 85 51
applicable 0 85 51
regarding 0 85 51
the 0 85 51
charge 0 85 51
against 0 85 51
Judge 0 85 51
Kavanaugh 0 85 51
since 0 85 51
he 0 85 51
is 0 85 51
not 0 85 51
a 0 85 51
defendant 0 85 51
in 0 85 51
a 0 85 51
criminal 0 85 51
trial. 0 85 51

However, 0 85 52
that 0 85 52
should 0 85 52
not 0 85 52
flip 0 85 52
the 0 85 52
burden 0 85 52
of 0 85 52
proof 0 85 52
onto 0 85 52
Judge 0 85 52
Kavanaugh 0 85 52
altogether. 0 85 52

Judge 0 85 53
Kavanaugh 0 85 53
is 0 85 53
being 0 85 53
subjected 0 85 53
to 0 85 53
charges 0 85 53
of 0 85 53
a 0 85 53
criminal 0 85 53
nature 0 85 53
that 0 85 53
could 0 85 53
not 0 85 53
only 0 85 53
deprive 0 85 53
him 0 85 53
of 0 85 53
a 0 85 53
seat 0 85 53
on 0 85 53
the 0 85 53
Supreme 0 85 53
Court 0 85 53
for 0 85 53
which 0 85 53
he 0 85 53
is 0 85 53
otherwise 0 85 53
eminently 0 85 53
qualified. 0 85 53

Ms. 0 85 54
Ford’s 0 85 54
unsubstantiated 0 85 54
accusation 0 85 54
can 0 85 54
completely 1 85 54
destroy 1 85 54
Judge 1 85 54
Kavanaugh’s 1 85 54
life 1 85 54
by 0 85 54
causing 0 85 54
irreparable 0 85 54
damage 0 85 54
to 0 85 54
his 0 85 54
reputation 0 85 54
for 0 85 54
integrity 0 85 54
and 0 85 54
good 0 85 54
character 0 85 54
and 0 85 54
to 0 85 54
his 0 85 54
career, 0 85 54
which 0 85 54
he 0 85 54
has 0 85 54
built 0 85 54
up 0 85 54
during 0 85 54
decades 0 85 54
of 0 85 54
public 0 85 54
service. 0 85 54

His 0 85 55
family’s 0 85 55
lives 0 85 55
have 0 85 55
been 0 85 55
completely 0 85 55
upended. 0 85 55

Placing 0 85 56
the 0 85 56
burden 0 85 56
on 0 85 56
Judge 0 85 56
Kavanaugh 0 85 56
to 0 85 56
prove 0 85 56
that 0 85 56
he 0 85 56
was 0 85 56
not 0 85 56
involved 0 85 56
in 0 85 56
an 0 85 56
uncorroborated 0 85 56
incident 0 85 56
from 0 85 56
years 0 85 56
ago, 0 85 56
about 0 85 56
which 0 85 56
even 0 85 56
his 0 85 56
accuser 0 85 56
does 0 85 56
not 0 85 56
recall 0 85 56
key 0 85 56
details, 0 85 56
turns 1 85 56
the 1 85 56
fundamental 1 85 56
constitutional 1 85 56
principle 1 85 56
of 1 85 56
due 1 85 56
process 1 85 56
upside 1 85 56
down. 1 85 56

Ms. 0 85 57
Ford 0 85 57
should 0 85 57
have 0 85 57
the 0 85 57
burden 0 85 57
to 0 85 57
prove 0 85 57
her 0 85 57
accusations 0 85 57
by 0 85 57
at 0 85 57
least 0 85 57
a 0 85 57
preponderance 0 85 57
of 0 85 57
all 0 85 57
the 0 85 57
evidence 0 85 57
presented. 0 85 57

This 1 85 58
charade 1 85 58
must 0 85 58
come 0 85 58
to 0 85 58
an 0 85 58
end. 0 85 58

No 0 85 59
more 0 85 59
extensions 0 85 59
for 0 85 59
Ms. 0 85 59
Ford 0 85 59
to 0 85 59
come 0 85 59
forward 0 85 59
and 0 85 59
testify. 0 85 59

If 0 85 60
Ms. 0 85 60
Ford 0 85 60
does 0 85 60
not 0 85 60
follow 0 85 60
through 0 85 60
with 0 85 60
her 0 85 60
agreement 0 85 60
to 0 85 60
testify 0 85 60
in 0 85 60
an 0 85 60
open 0 85 60
Senate 0 85 60
Judiciary 0 85 60
Committee 0 85 60
hearing 0 85 60
this 0 85 60
Thursday 0 85 60
and 0 85 60
do 0 85 60
so 0 85 60
upon 0 85 60
the 0 85 60
conditions 0 85 60
set 0 85 60
by 0 85 60
the 0 85 60
committee, 0 85 60
she 0 85 60
should 0 85 60
go 0 85 60
home 0 85 60
while 0 85 60
the 0 85 60
committee 0 85 60
proceeds 0 85 60
to 0 85 60
an 0 85 60
immediate 0 85 60
vote 0 85 60
on 0 85 60
Judge 0 85 60
Kavanaugh’s 0 85 60
nomination. 0 85 60

If 0 85 61
Ms. 0 85 61
Ford 0 85 61
and 0 85 61
Judge 0 85 61
Kavanaugh 0 85 61
do 0 85 61
testify, 0 85 61
the 0 85 61
senators 0 85 61
deciding 0 85 61
on 0 85 61
whether 0 85 61
to 0 85 61
confirm 0 85 61
Judge 0 85 61
Kavanaugh 0 85 61
as 0 85 61
well 0 85 61
as 0 85 61
the 0 85 61
American 0 85 61
public 0 85 61
following 0 85 61
the 0 85 61
testimony 0 85 61
must 0 85 61
remember 0 85 61
one 0 85 61
cardinal 0 85 61
rule. 0 85 61

In 1 85 62
a 1 85 62
nation 1 85 62
guided 1 85 62
by 1 85 62
fairness 1 85 62
and 1 85 62
law, 1 85 62
a 1 85 62
person 1 85 62
is 1 85 62
innocent 1 85 62
until 1 85 62
proven 1 85 62
guilty. 1 85 62

Sadly, 0 85 63
many 0 85 63
of 0 85 63
Judge 1 85 63
Kavanaugh’s 1 85 63
haters 1 85 63
have 0 85 63
thrown 0 85 63
that 0 85 63
rule 0 85 63
aside. 0 85 63

If 0 85 64
Judge 0 85 64
Kavanaugh’s 0 85 64
nomination 0 85 64
is 0 85 64
pulled 0 85 64
as 0 85 64
a 0 85 64
result 0 85 64
of 0 85 64
the 0 85 64
smears 1 85 64
and 0 85 64
character 1 85 64
assassination, 1 85 64
President 0 85 64
Trump 0 85 64
should 0 85 64
immediately 0 85 64
nominate 0 85 64
someone 0 85 64
on 0 85 64
his 0 85 64
short 0 85 64
list 0 85 64
such 0 85 64
as 0 85 64
Amy 0 85 64
Coney 0 85 64
Barrett 0 85 64
and 0 85 64
the 0 85 64
Senate 0 85 64
Republican 0 85 64
majority 0 85 64
should 0 85 64
then 0 85 64
push 0 85 64
through 0 85 64
the 0 85 64
new 0 85 64
nominee’s 0 85 64
confirmation 0 85 64
as 0 85 64
soon 0 85 64
as 0 85 64
possible. 0 85 64

Delay 0 85 65
is 0 85 65
not 0 85 65
an 0 85 65
option. 0 85 65
