a 0 59 16
senior 0 59 16

Berg 0 59 18
and 0 59 18
the 0 59 18
AMA 0 59 18

Does 0 59 19
Berg 0 59 19
and 0 59 19
the 0 59 19
AMA 0 59 19
support 0 59 19
our 1 59 19
military? 0 59 19

Do 0 59 20
they 0 59 20
not 0 59 20
know 0 59 20
that 0 59 20
18-year-olds 0 59 20
carry 0 59 20
firearms, 0 59 20
both 0 59 20
handguns 0 59 20
and 0 59 20
rifles? 0 59 20

I 0 59 21
ask, 0 59 21
as 0 59 21
I 0 59 21
do 0 59 21
with 0 59 21
the 0 59 21
issue 0 59 21
concerning 0 59 21
alcohol, 0 59 21
what 0 59 21
is 0 59 21
magic 0 59 21
about 0 59 21
the 0 59 21
age 0 59 21
of 0 59 21
21? 0 59 21

I 0 59 22
ask, 0 59 22
where 0 59 22
does 0 59 22
government 0 59 22
get 0 59 22
to 0 59 22
determine 0 59 22
who 0 59 22
gets 0 59 22
to 0 59 22
do 0 59 22
whatever 0 59 22
at 0 59 22
whatever 0 59 22
age 0 59 22
based 0 59 22
on 0 59 22
an 0 59 22
ambiguous 0 59 22
age 0 59 22
number? 0 59 22

Yet, 0 59 23
if 1 59 23
we 1 59 23
do 1 59 23
that, 1 59 23
we 1 59 23
won't 1 59 23
have 1 59 23
to 1 59 23
worry 1 59 23
about 1 59 23
mass 1 59 23
shooters, 1 59 23
right? 0 59 23

Wrong. 0 59 24

Yeah, 0 59 25
that's 0 59 25
gonna 0 59 25
keep 0 59 25
people 0 59 25
safe. 0 59 25

It's 0 59 26
going 0 59 26
to 0 59 26
infringe 0 59 26
on 0 59 26
the 0 59 26
rights 0 59 26
of 0 59 26
those 0 59 26
who 0 59 26
don't 0 59 26
commit 0 59 26
crimes 0 59 26
and 0 59 26
need 0 59 26
a 0 59 26
gun 0 59 26
to 0 59 26
protect 0 59 26
themselves 0 59 26
or 0 59 26
be 0 59 26
part 0 59 26
of 0 59 26
the 0 59 26
constitutional 0 59 26
militia. 0 59 26

The 0 59 27
AMA 0 59 27
also 0 59 27
wants 0 59 27
to 0 59 27
bypass 0 59 27
the 0 59 27
Fifth 0 59 27
Amendment 0 59 27

concerning 0 59 27

and 0 59 27
found 0 59 27
guilty 0 59 27
of 0 59 27
a 0 59 27
crime 0 59 27
being 0 59 27
deprived 0 59 27
of 0 59 27
their 0 59 27
liberty 0 59 27
and 0 59 27
property 0 59 27
as 0 59 27
they 0 59 27
promote 0 59 27
a 0 59 27
new 0 59 27
legal 0 59 27
procedure 0 59 27
by 0 59 27
which 0 59 27
“family 0 59 27
members, 0 59 27
intimate 0 59 27
partners, 0 59 27
household 0 59 27
members 0 59 27
and 0 59 27
law 0 59 27
enforcement 0 59 27
personnel” 0 59 27
can 0 59 27
petition 0 59 27
courts 0 59 27
to 0 59 27
confiscate 0 59 27
firearms 0 59 27
from 0 59 27
people 0 59 27
“when 0 59 27
there 0 59 27
is 0 59 27
a 0 59 27

or 0 59 27
imminent 0 59 27
risk 0 59 27
for 0 59 27
violence.” 0 59 27

They 0 59 28
want 0 59 28
to 0 59 28
do 0 59 28
what 0 59 28
President 0 59 28
Donald 0 59 28
Trump 0 59 28
suggested 0 59 28
and 0 59 28
"take 0 59 28
the 0 59 28

first" 0 59 28
and 0 59 28
forget 0 59 28
due 0 59 28
process. 0 59 28

See? 0 59 29

This 0 59 30
is 0 59 30
why 0 59 30
they 0 59 30
should 0 59 30
be 0 59 30
honest 0 59 30
about 0 59 30
who 0 59 30
they 0 59 30
are 0 59 30
and 0 59 30
name 0 59 30
themselves 0 59 30
the 0 59 30
Non-American 1 59 30
Medical 0 59 30
Association. 0 59 30

I'm 0 59 31
all 0 59 31
for 0 59 31
situations 0 59 31
like 0 59 31
Nikolas 0 59 31
Cruz 0 59 31
who 0 59 31
assaulted 0 59 31
teachers 0 59 31
and 0 59 31
students 0 59 31
being 0 59 31
arrested 0 59 31
and 0 59 31
tried 0 59 31
and 0 59 31
dealt 0 59 31
with 0 59 31
lawfully, 0 59 31
but 0 59 31
to 0 59 31
go 0 59 31
seizing 0 59 31
people's 0 59 31
property 0 59 31
and 0 59 31
denying 0 59 31
them 0 59 31
their 0 59 31
liberty 0 59 31
base 0 59 31
on 0 59 31
the 0 59 31
hearsay 0 59 31
of 0 59 31
another 0 59 31
person 0 59 31
is 0 59 31
anti-constitutional 0 59 31
and 0 59 31
anti-American. 1 59 31

Who 0 59 32
knows 0 59 32
exactly 0 59 32
what 0 59 32
they 0 59 32
mean 0 59 32
by 0 59 32
high-capacity 0 59 32
magazines. 0 59 32

I 0 59 33
mean, 0 59 33
for 0 59 33
the 0 59 33
most 0 59 33
part, 0 59 33
you 0 59 33
can 0 59 33
obtain 0 59 33
20 0 59 33
or 0 59 33
30 0 59 33
round 0 59 33
magazines 0 59 33
for 0 59 33
both 0 59 33
handguns 0 59 33
and 0 59 33
rifles. 0 59 33

In 0 59 34
some 0 59 34
cases, 0 59 34
you 0 59 34
can 0 59 34
purchase 0 59 34
drums 0 59 34
which 0 59 34
hold 0 59 34
50-100 0 59 34
rounds, 0 59 34
but 0 59 34
if 0 59 34
you 0 59 34
are 0 59 34
in 0 59 34
New 0 59 34
York, 0 59 34
the 0 59 34
NY 0 59 34
SAFE 0 59 34
Act 0 59 34
defines 0 59 34
your 0 59 34

anything 0 59 34
more 0 59 34
than 0 59 34
7 0 59 34
rounds. 0 59 34

As 0 59 35
for 0 59 35
the 0 59 35
nonsensical 1 59 35
call 0 59 35
to 0 59 35

Newly 0 59 45
adopted 0 59 45
policy 0 59 45
also 0 59 45

the 0 59 45

concealed 0 59 48
carry 0 59 48
reciprocity, 0 59 48
which 0 59 48
I 0 59 48
do 0 59 48
as 0 59 48
well, 0 59 48
but 0 59 48
based 0 59 48
on 0 59 48
the 0 59 48
principle 0 59 48
that 0 59 48
the 0 59 48
Second 0 59 48
Amendment's 0 59 48
protections 0 59 48
extend 0 59 48
to 0 59 48
the 0 59 48
various 0 59 48
states 0 59 48
as 0 59 48
well, 0 59 48
since 0 59 48
it 0 59 48
recognizes 0 59 48
a 1 59 48
right, 1 59 48
not 1 59 48
a 1 59 48
permission, 1 59 48
to 1 59 48
keep 1 59 48
and 1 59 48
bear 1 59 48
arms. 1 59 48

I 0 59 49
also 0 59 49
oppose 0 59 49
it 0 59 49
because 0 59 49
it's 0 59 49
just 0 59 49
another 0 59 49
step 0 59 49
for 0 59 49
the 0 59 49
federal 0 59 49
government 0 59 49
to 0 59 49
say 0 59 49
they 0 59 49
need 0 59 49
a 0 59 49
database 0 59 49
so 0 59 49
states 0 59 49
can 0 59 49
check, 0 59 49
thus 0 59 49
identifying 0 59 49
gun 0 59 49
owners 0 59 49
and 0 59 49
possibly 0 59 49
their 0 59 49
