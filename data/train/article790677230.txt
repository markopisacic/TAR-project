Kavanaugh's 0
Nomination 0
Saved? 0

Supreme 0
Court 0
nominee 0
Brett 0
Kavanaugh’s 0
outstanding 0
performance 0
at 0
yesterday’s 0
evidentiary 0
hearing 0
featuring 0
attempted 0
rape 0
accuser 0
Christine 0
Blasey 0
Ford 0
may 0
have 0
revived 0
his 0
embattled 0
nomination 0
for 0
the 0
highest 0
court 0
in 0
America. 0

The 0
meeting 0
of 0
the 0
Senate 0
Judiciary 0
Committee 0
showed 0
the 0
underhanded 0
tactics 0
employed 0
by 0
the 0
Left 0
against 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh. 0

The 0
nominee 0
and 0
Republican 0
senators 0
used 0
the 0
opportunity 0
to 0
attack 0
desperate 0
Democrats 0
for 0
their 0
efforts 0
at 0
character 1
assassination. 1

President 0
Trump 0
was 0
delighted. 0

“Judge 0
Kavanaugh 0
showed 0
America 0
exactly 0
why 0
I 0
nominated 0
him[,]” 0
President 0
Trump 0
tweeted 0
at 0
6:46 0
p.m. 0
after 0
the 0
hearing 0
wrapped 0
up. 0

“His 0
testimony 0
was 0
powerful, 0
honest, 0
and 0
riveting. 0

Democrats’ 0
search 1
and 1
destroy 1
strategy 1
is 0
disgraceful 0
and 0
this 0
process 0
has 0
been 0
a 0
total 1
sham 1
and 0
effort 0
to 0
delay, 0
obstruct, 0
and 0
resist. 0

The 1
Senate 1
must 1
vote!” 1

Ford, 0
who 0
claims 0
Kavanaugh 0
tried 0
to 0
rape 0
her 0
decades 0
ago 0
when 0
he 0
was 0
a 0
high 0
school 0
student, 0
appeared 0
before 0
the 0
Senate 0
Judiciary 0
Committee 0
for 0
several 0
hours 0
Thursday. 0

Kavanaugh 0
testified 0
separately 0
after 0
Ford’s 0
testimony 0
concluded. 0

Kavanaugh 1
stole 1
the 1
show. 1

The 0
judge 0
forcefully 0
stood 0
up 0
for 0
himself 0
as 0
his 0
voice 0
trembled 1
with 1
righteous 1
indignation, 1
calling 0
out 0
Democratic 0
senators 0
for 0
plotting 0
against 0
him. 0

The 0
behavior 0
of 0
several 0
of 0
the 0
Democratic 0
members 0
of 0
this 0
committee 0
at 0
my 0
hearing 0
a 0
few 0
weeks 0
ago 0
was 0
an 0
embarrassment. 0

But 0
at 0
least 0
it 0
was 0
just 0
a 0
good 0
old-fashioned 0
attempt 0
at 0
Borking. 0

Those 0
efforts 0
didn't 0
work. 0

When 0
I 0
did 0
at 0
least 0
okay 0
enough 0
at 0
the 0
hearings 0
that 0
it 0
looked 0
like 0
I 0
might 0
actually 0
get 0
confirmed, 0
a 0
new 0
tactic 0
was 0
needed. 0

Some 0
of 0
you 0
were 0
lying 0
in 0
wait 0
and 0
had 0
it 0
ready. 0

This 0
first 0
allegation 0
was 0
held 0
in 0
secret 0
for 0
weeks 0
by 0
a 0
Democratic 0
member 0
of 0
this 0
committee, 0
and 0
by 0
staff. 0

It 0
would 0
be 0
needed 0
only 0
if 0
you 0
couldn't 0
take 0
me 0
out 0
on 0
the 0
merits. 0

When 0
it 0
was 0
needed, 0
this 0
allegation 0
was 0
unleashed 0
and 0
publicly 0
deployed 0
over 0
Dr. 0
Ford's 0
wishes. 0

And 0
then, 0
and 1
then 1
as 0
no 0
doubt 0
was 0
expected, 0
if 0
not 0
planned, 0
came 0
a 0
long 0
series 0
of 0
false 0
last-minute 1
smears 1
designed 0
to 0
scare 0
me 0
and 0
drive 0
me 0
out 0
of 0
the 0
process 0
before 0
any 0
hearing 0
occurred. 0

Afraid 1
of 1
their 1
own 1
shadows, 1
committee 0
Republicans 0
didn’t 0
relish 0
the 0
prospect 0
of 0
their 0
all-male 1
team 1
of 0
11 0
senators 0
questioning 0
a 0
woman 0
so 0
they 0
hired 0
sex-crimes 0
prosecutor 0
Rachel 0
Mitchell 0
of 0
Maricopa 0
County, 0
Arizona, 0
to 0
examine 0
Ford. 0

Opinions 0
differ 0
widely 0
on 0
how 0
Mitchell 0
performed. 0

She 0
tiptoed 0
around 0
the 0
alleged 0
sexual 0
assault 0
itself, 0
instead 0
focusing 0
on 0
process-related 0
questions, 0
presumably 0
in 0
an 0
effort 0
to 0
show 0
undecided 0
senators 0
how 0
Ford 0
and 0
her 0
handlers 0
have 0
been 0
unfairly 0
manipulating 0
the 0
process. 0

In 0
much 0
of 0
her 0
testimony, 0
Ford 0
came 0
across 0
as 0
presentable 0
and 0
seemingly 0
credible, 0
though 0
vague 0
and 0
sometimes 0
evasive, 0
her 0
ridiculous 1
overall 1
story 1
notwithstanding. 0

Ford 0
did 0
well 0
enough 0
that 0
during 0
the 0
break 0
between 0
her 0
testimony 0
and 0
Kavanaugh’s, 0
commentators 0
on 0
Fox 0
News 0
such 0
as 0
Brit 0
Hume 0
and 0
Andrew 0
Napolitano 0
were 0
openly 0
musing 0
about 0
the 0
nominee 0
withdrawing, 0
opinions 0
that 0
were 0
sharply 0
reversed 0
after 0
the 0
nominee 0
completed 0
his 0
testimony 0
hours 0
later. 0

It’s 0
not 0
that 0
Mitchell 0
did 0
a 0
bad 0
job 0
creating 0
an 0
inventory 0
of 0
the 0
irregularities 0
in 0
the 0
process 0
and 0
of 0
the 0
odd 0
behavior 0
of 0
Ford 0
and 0
her 0
lawyers. 0

She 0
could 0
do 0
little 0
else. 0

She 0
had 0
many 0
restrictions 0
placed 0
upon 0
her 0
and 0
was 0
only 0
allowed 0
to 0
question 0
Ford 0
for 0
minutes 0
at 0
a 0
time 0
before 0
surrendering 0
the 0
floor 0
to 0
the 0
next 0
committee 0
Democrat. 0

As 0
commentator 0
Sean 0
Davis 0
tweeted: 0

“Hard 1
to 1
do 1
much 1
else 1
when 1
the 1
witness 1
conveniently 1
has 1
no 1
corroborating 1
evidence, 1
no 1
memory 1
of 1
any 1
verifiable 1
facts 1
of 1
what 1
happened, 1
and 1
everyone 1
she 1
says 1
was 1
present 1
at 1
the 1
alleged 1
incident--even 1
her 1
best 1
friend--has 1
denied 1
it.” 1

Nonetheless, 0
Mitchell’s 0
questioning 0
came 0
across 0
at 0
times 0
as 0
perfunctory, 0
leading 0
many 0
observers 0
to 0
conclude 0
that 0
Republicans 0
threw 0
away 0
a 0
valuable 0
opportunity 0
by 0
using 0
her 0
as 0
a 0
stand-in. 0

She 0
failed 0
to 0
lay 0
a 0
glove 0
on 0
a 0
witness 0
whose 0
implausible, 0
internally 0
contradictory 0
story 0
cried 1
out 1
for 1
vigorous 1
cross-examination. 1

In 0
the 0
end 0
the 0
too-deferential, 0
easygoing 0
Mitchell 0
failed 0
to 0
provide 0
much, 0
if 0
anything, 0
in 0
the 0
way 0
of 0
evidence 0
against 0
Ford 0
or 0
in 0
favor 0
of 0
Kavanaugh. 0

Whether 0
her 0
work 0
will 0
bring 0
over 0
fence-sitting 0
senators 0
to 0
Kavanaugh’s 0
side 0
remains 0
to 0
be 0
seen. 0

Like 0
other 0
Democrats, 0
Sen. 0
Mazie 0
Hirono 0
of 0
Hawaii 0
tried 0
to 0
help 0
Ford, 0
lobbing 1
her 1
softballs. 1

After 0
saying 0
she 0
thought 0
she 0
knew 0
what 0
Mitchell 0
was 0
trying 0
to 0
get 0
at 0
in 0
her 0
questions, 0
the 0
senator 0
said, 0
“so 0
I'll 0
just 0
ask 0
you 0
very 0
plainly, 0
Dr. 0
Ford, 0
is 1
there 1
a 1
political 1
motivation 1
for 1
your 1
coming 1
forward 1
with 1
your 1
account 1
of 1
the 1
assault 1
by 1
Brett 1
Kavanaugh?” 1

“No, 0
and 0
I'd 0
like 0
to 0
reiterate 0
that 0
again, 0
I 0
was 0
trying 0
to 0
get 0
the 0
information 0
to 0
you 0
while 0
there 0
was 0
still 0
a 0
list 0
of 0
other 0
what 0
looked 0
like 0
equally-qualified 0
candidates,” 0
Ford 0
replied. 0

When 0
Sen. 0
Dick 0
Durbin 0
(D-Ill.) 0
asked 0
Ford 0
“with 0
what 0
degree 0
of 0
certainty 0
do 0
you 0
believe 0
Brett 0
Kavanaugh 0
assaulted 0
you?” 0
Ford 0
replied, 0
“one 0
hundred 0
percent.” 0

Strangely, 0
Ford 1
has 1
a 1
bad 1
long-term 1
memory 1
and 1
a 1
bad 1
short-term 1
memory. 1

She 0
doesn’t 0
know 0
when 0
or 0
where 0
the 0
alleged 0
incident 0
took 0
place, 0
yet 0
she 0
is 0
“one 0
hundred 0
percent” 0
certain 0
it 0
was 0
Kavanaugh 0
who 0
attacked 0
her. 0

At 0
the 0
outset 0
of 0
the 0
hearing, 0
Grassley 0
provided 0
an 0
overview 0
of 0
what 0
Kavanaugh 0
had 0
gone 0
through 0
–including 0
the 0
Democrats’ 0
sordid 0
behavior— 0
since 0
President 0
Trump 0
announced 0
the 0
judge’s 0
nomination 0
on 0
July 0
9. 0

As 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
confirmation 0
process, 0
Kavanaugh 0
endured 0
his 0
sixth 0
background 0
investigation 0
since 0
1993. 0

“Nowhere 0
in 0
any 0
of 0
these 0
six 0
FBI 0
reports, 0
which 0
committee 0
investigators 0
have 0
reviewed 0
on 0
a 0
bipartisan 0
basis, 0
was 0
there 0
a 0
whiff 0
of 0
any 0
issue 0
– 0
any 1
issue 1
at 0
all 0
related 0
in 0
any 0
way 0
to 0
inappropriate 0
sexual 0
behavior,” 0
Grassley 0
said. 0

Ford 0
shared 0
her 0
allegations 0
in 0
a 0
letter 0
to 0
the 0
committee’s 0
ranking 0
member, 0
Dianne 0
Feinstein 0
(D-Calif.), 0
in 0
the 0
summer. 0

The 0
letter 0
remained 0
secret 0
from 0
July 0
30 0
through 0
until 0
September 0
13 0
when 0
he 0
first 0
learned 0
about 0
it, 0
the 0
chairman 0
said. 0

Instead 0
of 0
sharing 0
the 0
letter 0
with 0
the 0
committee, 0
Feinstein 0
did 0
nothing. 0

Before 0
the 0
hearing, 0
Kavanaugh 0
met 0
privately 0
with 0
65 0
senators, 0
including 0
Feinstein, 0
who 0
didn’t 0
ask 0
him 0
about 0
the 0
allegations 0
when 0
she 0
met 0
with 0
him 0
in 0
August. 0

The 0
committee 0
held 0
a 0
four-day 0
public 0
hearing 0
from 0
September 0
4 0
to 0
September 0
7 0
during 0
which 0
Kavanaugh 0
testified 0
for 0
more 0
than 0
32 0
hours 0
in 0
public. 0

Feinstein 0
didn’t 0
attend 0
it, 0
Grassley 0
said. 0

Kavanaugh 0
answered 0
almost 0
1,300 0
written 0
questions 0
senators 0
submitted 0
after 0
the 0
hearing. 0

That 0
is 0
“more 0
than 0
all 0
prior 0
Supreme 0
Court 0
nominees,” 0
he 0
said. 0

“Throughout 0
this 0
period, 0
we 0
did 0
not 0
know 0
about 0
the 0
ranking 0
member's 0
secret 0
evidence. 0

Then, 0
only 0
at 0
an 0
11th 0
hour, 0
on 0
the 0
eve 0
of 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh's 0
confirmation 0
vote, 0
did 0
the 0
ranking 0
member 0
refer 0
the 0
allegations 0
to 0
the 0
FBI. 0

And 0
then, 0
sadly, 0
the 0
allegations 0
were 0
leaked 0
to 0
the 0
press.” 0

“Every 0
step 0
of 0
the 0
way 0
the 0
Democratic 0
side 0
refused 0
to 0
participate 0
in 0
what 0
should 0
have 0
been 0
a 0
bipartisan 0
investigation,” 0
Grassley 0
said. 0

After 0
Ford’s 0
identity 0
became 0
public, 0
Grassley’s 0
staff 0
“contacted 0
all 0
the 0
individuals 0
she 0
said 0
attended 0
the 0
1982 0
party 0
described 0
in 0
the 0
Washington 0
Post 0
article,” 0
he 0
said. 0

Kavanaugh 0
“immediately 0
submitted 0
to 0
an 0
interview 0
under 0
penalty 0
of 0
felony 0
for 0
any 0
knowingly 0
false 0
statements. 0

He 0
denied 0
the 0
allegations 0
categorically.” 0

“Democratic 0
staff 0
was 0
invited 0
to 0
participate 0
and 0
could 0
have 0
asked 0
any 0
questions 0
they 0
wanted 0
to, 0
but 0
they 0
declined. 0

Which 0
leads 0
me 0
then 0
to 0
wonder: 0
If 1
they're 1
really 1
concerned 1
with 1
going 1
to 1
the 1
truth, 1
why 1
wouldn't 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
talk 1
to 1
the 1
accused?” 1

Grassley 0
said 0
his 0
staff 0
contacted 0
the 0
other 0
individuals 0
who 0
allegedly 0
attended 0
the 0
party 0
at 0
which 0
the 0
conduct 0
Ford 0
complained 0
of 0
allegedly 0
took 0
place: 0
Mark 0
Judge, 0
Patrick 0
Smyth, 0
and 0
Leland 0
Keyser. 0

“All 0
three 0
submitted 0
statements 0
to 0
the 0
Senate 0
under 0
– 0
under 0
penalty 0
of 0
felony, 0
denying 0
any 0
knowledge 0
of 0
the 0
events 0
described 0
by 0
Dr. 0
Ford. 0

Dr. 0
Ford's 0
lifelong 0
friend, 0
Dr. 0
– 0
Miss 0
Keyser, 0
stated 0
she 0
doesn't 0
know 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh 0
and 0
doesn't 0
recall 0
ever 0
attending 0
a 0
party 0
with 0
him.” 0

Grassley 0
said 0
his 0
staff 0
repeatedly 0
sought 0
to 0
interview 0
Ford 0
over 0
the 0
past 0
11 0
days, 0
“even 0
volunteering 0
to 0
fly 0
to 0
California 0
to 0
take 0
her 0
testimony, 0
but 0
her 0
attorneys 0
refused 0
to 0
prevent 0
– 0
present 0
her 0
allegations 0
to 0
Congress.” 0

“Consistent 0
with 0
their 0
stated 0
desires 0
to 0
obstruct 0
Kavanaugh's 0
nomination” 0
by 0
any 0
means 0
possible, 0
“pushed 0
for 0
FBI 0
investigations 0
into 0
the 0
allegations.” 0

“We've 0
been 0
trying 0
to 0
investigate 0
other 0
allegations,” 0
Grassley 0
said. 0

“At 0
this 0
time, 0
we 0
have 0
not 0
had 0
cooperation 0
from 0
attorneys 0
representing 0
other 0
clients, 0
and 0
they 0
have 0
made 0
no 0
attempt 0
to 0
substantiate 0
their 0
claims.” 0

Attorneys 0
for 0
new 0
Kavanaugh 0
accusers 0
Deborah 0
Ramirez 0
and 0
Julie 0
Swetnick 0
have 0
been 0
approached 0
by 0
committee 0
staff 0
on 0
eight 0
and 0
six 0
occasions, 0
respectively, 0
Grassley 0
said. 0

“Neither 0
attorney 0
has 0
made 0
their 0
clients 0
available 0
for 0
interview. 0

The 0
committee 0
can't 0
do 0
an 0
investigation 0
if 0
attorneys 0
are 0
stonewalling.” 1

With 0
his 0
performance 0
at 0
the 0
hearing, 0
Sen. 0
Lindsey 0
Graham 0
(R-S.C.), 0
who 0
is 0
frequently 0
a 0
target 0
of 0
conservatives 0
for 0
going 1
rogue 1
on 0
important 0
issues, 0
partly 0
redeemed 0
himself 0
in 0
the 0
eyes 0
of 0
many 0
conservatives. 0

While 0
questioning 0
Kavanaugh, 0
Graham 0
lambasted 0
the 0
confirmation 0
process 0
the 0
judge 0
has 0
been 0
put 0
through, 0
calling 0
it 0
“the 1
most 1
unethical 1
sham 1
since 1
I've 1
been 1
in 1
politics.” 1

Lashing 0
out 0
at 0
Democrats, 0
Graham 0
said, 0
“If 0
you 0
wanted 0
an 0
FBI 0
investigation, 0
you 0
could 0
have 0
come 0
to 0
us. 0

What 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
do 1
is 1
destroy 1
this 1
guy's 1
life, 1
hold 1
this 1
seat 1
open 1
and 1
hope 1
you 1
win 1
in 1
2020.” 1

“Boy, 1
you 1
all 1
want 1
power,” 1
he 0
shouted. 0

“God, 0
I 0
hope 0
you 0
never 0
get 0
it. 0

I 1
hope 1
the 1
American 1
people 1
can 1
see 1
through 1
this 1
sham.” 1

Graham 0
warned 0
fellow 0
GOPers 0
about 0
voting 0
against 0
the 0
nomination. 0

“To 0
my 0
Republican 0
colleagues, 0
if 1
you 1
vote 1
no, 1
you're 1
legitimizing 1
the 1
most 1
despicable 1
thing 1
I 1
have 1
seen 1
in 1
my 1
time 1
in 1
politics. 1

You 0
