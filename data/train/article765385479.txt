The 1 337 1
persecution 1 337 1
of 1 337 1
Julian 1 337 1
Assange 1 337 1
must 1 337 1
end. 1 337 1

Or 1 337 2
it 1 337 2
will 1 337 2
end 1 337 2
in 1 337 2
tragedy. 1 337 2

The 0 337 3
Australian 0 337 3

and 0 337 3
prime 0 337 3
minister 0 337 3
Malcolm 0 337 3

have 0 337 3
an 0 337 3
historic 0 337 3
opportunity 0 337 3
to 0 337 3
decide 0 337 3
which 0 337 3
it 0 337 3
will 0 337 3
be. 0 337 3

They 1 337 4
can 1 337 4
remain 1 337 4
silent, 1 337 4
for 1 337 4
which 1 337 4
history 1 337 4
will 1 337 4
be 1 337 4
unforgiving. 1 337 4

Or 1 337 5
they 1 337 5
can 1 337 5
act 1 337 5
in 1 337 5
the 1 337 5
interests 1 337 5
of 1 337 5
justice 1 337 5

Assange 0 337 6
does 0 337 6
not 0 337 6
ask 0 337 6
for 0 337 6
special 0 337 6

The 0 337 7

clear 0 337 7
diplomatic 0 337 7

gross 1 337 7
injustice: 1 337 7
in 0 337 7
Julian’s 0 337 7
case, 0 337 7
from 0 337 7
a 0 337 7
gross 1 337 7
miscarriage 1 337 7
of 1 337 7
justice 1 337 7
and 1 337 7
the 1 337 7
extreme 1 337 7
danger 1 337 7
that 1 337 7
await 1 337 7
him 1 337 7

from 0 337 8

know 0 337 9
Julian 0 337 9

well; 0 337 9
I 0 337 9

him 0 337 9
as 0 337 9
a 0 337 9

a 1 337 9

of 1 337 9
extraordinary 1 337 9
resilience 1 337 9
and 1 337 9
courage. 1 337 9

I 0 337 10
have 0 337 10
watched 0 337 10
a 1 337 10
tsunami 1 337 10
of 1 337 10

him, 1 337 10
endlessly, 1 337 10
vindictively, 1 337 10
perfidiously; 1 337 10
and 0 337 10
I 0 337 10
know 0 337 10
why 0 337 10
they 0 337 10

him. 0 337 10

In 0 337 11
2008, 0 337 11
a 0 337 11

This 0 337 15
would 0 337 15

they 0 337 15
wrote, 0 337 15

of 0 337 15
“exposure 0 337 15

a 1 337 15
unrelenting 1 337 15
assault 1 337 15
on 0 337 15
reputation. 0 337 15

The 0 337 16
aim 0 337 16
was 0 337 16
to 0 337 16

main 0 337 19
weapon 0 337 19
would 0 337 19

personal 1 337 19

Their 1 337 20

would 0 337 20
be 0 337 20
enlisted 0 337 20
in 0 337 20

what 0 337 21

do. 0 337 21

I 0 337 22
call 0 337 22
them 0 337 22
Vichy 1 337 22
journalists 1 337 22
— 0 337 22
after 1 337 22
the 1 337 22
Vichy 1 337 22
government 1 337 22
that 1 337 22
served 1 337 22
and 1 337 22
enabled 1 337 22
the 1 337 22
German 1 337 22
occupation 1 337 22
of 1 337 22
wartime 1 337 22
France. 1 337 22

Last 0 337 23
October, 0 337 23
the 0 337 23
Australian 0 337 23
Broadcasting 0 337 23
Corporation 0 337 23
journalist 0 337 23
Sarah 0 337 23
Ferguson 0 337 23
interviewed 0 337 23
Hillary 0 337 23
Clinton, 0 337 23
over 1 337 23
whom 1 337 23
she 1 337 23
fawned 1 337 23
as 0 337 23
“the 1 337 23
icon 1 337 23
for 1 337 23
your 1 337 23
generation”. 1 337 23

This 0 337 24
was 0 337 24
the 0 337 24
same 0 337 24
Clinton 0 337 24
who 0 337 24
threatened 0 337 24
to 0 337 24
“obliterate 1 337 24
totally” 1 337 24
Iran 0 337 24
and, 0 337 24
who, 0 337 24
as 0 337 24
U.S. 0 337 24
secretary 0 337 24
of 0 337 24
State 0 337 24
in 0 337 24
2011, 0 337 24
was 0 337 24
one 1 337 24
of 1 337 24
the 1 337 24
instigators 1 337 24
of 1 337 24
the 1 337 24
invasion 1 337 24
and 1 337 24
destruction 1 337 24
of 1 337 24
Libya 1 337 24
as 1 337 24
a 1 337 24
modern 1 337 24
state, 1 337 24
with 0 337 24
the 0 337 24
loss 0 337 24
of 0 337 24
40,000 0 337 24
lives. 0 337 24

Like 1 337 25
the 1 337 25
invasion 1 337 25
of 1 337 25
Iraq, 1 337 25
it 1 337 25
was 1 337 25
based 1 337 25
on 1 337 25
lies. 1 337 25

When 0 337 26
the 0 337 26
Libyan 0 337 26
President 0 337 26
was 0 337 26
murdered 1 337 26
publicly 1 337 26
and 1 337 26
gruesomely 1 337 26
with 0 337 26
a 0 337 26
knife, 0 337 26
Clinton 0 337 26
was 0 337 26
filmed 0 337 26
whooping 1 337 26
and 1 337 26
cheering. 1 337 26

Thanks 1 337 27
largely 1 337 27
to 1 337 27
her, 1 337 27
Libya 1 337 27
became 1 337 27
a 1 337 27
breeding 1 337 27
ground 1 337 27
for 1 337 27
ISIS 1 337 27
and 1 337 27
other 1 337 27
jihadists. 1 337 27

Thanks 1 337 28
largely 1 337 28
to 1 337 28
her, 1 337 28
tens 1 337 28
of 1 337 28
thousands 1 337 28

Today, 0 337 32
Saudi 0 337 32

Sarah 0 337 33
Ferguson, 0 337 33
a 1 337 33
highly 1 337 33
paid 1 337 33

raised 0 337 33
not 0 337 33
a 0 337 33

of 0 337 33
this 0 337 33

sitting 0 337 33
in 0 337 33
front 0 337 33
of 0 337 33
her. 0 337 33

Instead, 0 337 34
she 0 337 34
invited 0 337 34
Clinton 0 337 34
to 0 337 34
describe 0 337 34
the 0 337 34

In 0 337 35
response, 0 337 35
Clinton 1 337 35
defamed 1 337 35
Assange, 1 337 35
an 1 337 35
Australian 1 337 35

as 0 337 35
“very 0 337 35

and 0 337 35
“a 0 337 35

In 0 337 73
its 0 337 73
revelations 0 337 73
of 0 337 73
fraudulent 1 337 73
wars 1 337 73
(Afghanistan, 0 337 73
Iraq) 0 337 73
and 0 337 73
the 0 337 73
bald-faced 1 337 73
lies 1 337 73
of 1 337 73
governments 1 337 73
(the 0 337 73
Chagos 0 337 73
Islands), 0 337 73
WikiLeaks 0 337 73
has 0 337 73
allowed 0 337 73
us 0 337 73
to 0 337 73
glimpse 0 337 73
how 0 337 73
the 0 337 73
imperial 0 337 73
game 0 337 73
is 0 337 73
played 0 337 73
in 0 337 73
the 0 337 73
21st 0 337 73
century. 0 337 73

That 0 337 74
is 0 337 74
why 0 337 74
Assange 1 337 74
is 1 337 74
in 1 337 74
mortal 1 337 74
danger. 1 337 74

Seven 0 337 75
years 0 337 75
ago, 0 337 75
in 0 337 75
Sydney, 0 337 75
I 0 337 75
arranged 0 337 75
to 0 337 75
meet 0 337 75
a 0 337 75
prominent 0 337 75
Liberal 0 337 75
Member 0 337 75
of 0 337 75
the 0 337 75
Federal 0 337 75
Parliament, 0 337 75
Malcolm 0 337 75
Turnbull. 0 337 75

I 0 337 76
wanted 0 337 76
to 0 337 76
ask 0 337 76
him 0 337 76
to 0 337 76
deliver 0 337 76
a 0 337 76
letter 0 337 76
from 0 337 76
Gareth 0 337 76
Peirce, 0 337 76
Assange’s 0 337 76
lawyer, 0 337 76
to 0 337 76
the 0 337 76
government. 0 337 76

We 0 337 77
talked 0 337 77
about 0 337 77
his 0 337 77
famous 0 337 77
victory 0 337 77
— 0 337 77
in 0 337 77
the 0 337 77
1980s 0 337 77
when, 0 337 77
as 0 337 77
a 0 337 77
young 0 337 77
barrister, 0 337 77
he 0 337 77
had 0 337 77
fought 0 337 77
the 0 337 77
British 0 337 77
Government’s 0 337 77
attempts 0 337 77
to 0 337 77
suppress 0 337 77
free 0 337 77
speech 0 337 77
and 0 337 77
prevent 0 337 77
the 0 337 77
publication 0 337 77
of 0 337 77
the 0 337 77
book 0 337 77
Spycatcher 0 337 77
— 0 337 77
in 0 337 77
its 0 337 77
way, 0 337 77
a 0 337 77
WikiLeaks 0 337 77
of 0 337 77
the 0 337 77
time, 0 337 77
for 0 337 77
it 0 337 77
revealed 0 337 77
the 0 337 77
crimes 0 337 77
of 0 337 77
state 0 337 77
power. 0 337 77

The 0 337 78
prime 0 337 78
minister 0 337 78
of 0 337 78
Australia 0 337 78
was 0 337 78
then 0 337 78
Julia 0 337 78
Gillard, 0 337 78
a 0 337 78
Labor 0 337 78
Party 0 337 78
politician 0 337 78
who 0 337 78
had 0 337 78
declared 0 337 78
WikiLeaks 0 337 78
“illegal” 0 337 78
and 0 337 78
wanted 0 337 78
to 0 337 78
cancel 0 337 78
Assange’s 0 337 78
passport 0 337 78
— 0 337 78
until 1 337 78
she 1 337 78
was 1 337 78
told 1 337 78
she 1 337 78
could 1 337 78
not 1 337 78
do 1 337 78
this: 1 337 78
that 1 337 78
Assange 1 337 78
had 1 337 78
committed 1 337 78
no 1 337 78
crime: 1 337 78
that 1 337 78
WikiLeaks 1 337 78
was 1 337 78
a 1 337 78
publisher, 1 337 78
whose 1 337 78
work 1 337 78
was 1 337 78
protected 1 337 78
under 1 337 78
Article 1 337 78
19 1 337 78
of 1 337 78
the 1 337 78
Universal 1 337 78
Declaration 1 337 78
of 1 337 78
Human 1 337 78
Rights, 1 337 78
to 1 337 78
which 1 337 78
Australia 1 337 78
was 1 337 78
one 1 337 78
of 1 337 78
the 1 337 78
original 1 337 78
signatories. 1 337 78

In 0 337 79
abandoning 0 337 79
Assange, 0 337 79
an 1 337 79
Australian 1 337 79
citizen, 1 337 79
and 0 337 79
colluding 0 337 79
in 0 337 79
his 0 337 79
persecution, 0 337 79
Prime 0 337 79
Minister 0 337 79
Gillard’s 0 337 79
outrageous 1 337 79
behaviour 1 337 79
forced 0 337 79
the 0 337 79
issue 0 337 79
of 0 337 79
his 0 337 79
recognition, 0 337 79
under 0 337 79
international 0 337 79
law, 0 337 79
as 0 337 79
a 0 337 79
political 0 337 79
refugee 0 337 79
whose 0 337 79
life 0 337 79
was 0 337 79
at 0 337 79
risk. 0 337 79

Ecuador 0 337 80
invoked 0 337 80
the 0 337 80
1951 0 337 80
Convention 0 337 80
and 0 337 80
granted 0 337 80
Assange 0 337 80
refuge 0 337 80
in 0 337 80
its 0 337 80
embassy 0 337 80
in 0 337 80
London. 0 337 80

Gillard 0 337 81
has 0 337 81
recently 0 337 81
been 0 337 81
appearing 0 337 81
in 0 337 81
a 0 337 81
gig 0 337 81
with 0 337 81
Hillary 0 337 81
Clinton; 0 337 81
they 0 337 81
are 0 337 81
billed 0 337 81
as 0 337 81
pioneering 1 337 81
feminists. 1 337 81

If 0 337 82
there 0 337 82
is 0 337 82
anything 0 337 82
to 0 337 82
remember 0 337 82
Gillard 0 337 82
by, 0 337 82
it 0 337 82
a 0 337 82
warmongering, 1 337 82
sycophantic, 1 337 82
embarrassing 1 337 82
speech 1 337 82
she 0 337 82
made 0 337 82
to 0 337 82
the 0 337 82
US 0 337 82
Congress 0 337 82
soon 0 337 82
after 0 337 82
she 0 337 82
demanded 0 337 82
the 0 337 82
illegal 0 337 82
cancellation 0 337 82
of 0 337 82
Julian’s 0 337 82
passport. 0 337 82

Malcolm 0 337 83
Turnbull 0 337 83
is 0 337 83
now 0 337 83
the 0 337 83
Prime 0 337 83
Minister 0 337 83
of 0 337 83
Australia. 0 337 83

Julian 0 337 84
Assange’s 0 337 84
father 0 337 84
has 0 337 84
written 0 337 84
to 0 337 84
Turnbull. 0 337 84

It 0 337 85
is 0 337 85
a 0 337 85
moving 0 337 85
letter, 0 337 85
in 0 337 85
which 0 337 85
he 0 337 85
has 0 337 85
appealed 0 337 85
to 0 337 85
the 0 337 85
prime 0 337 85
minister 0 337 85
to 0 337 85
bring 0 337 85
his 0 337 85
son 0 337 85
home. 0 337 85

He 0 337 86
refers 0 337 86
to 0 337 86
the 0 337 86
real 0 337 86
possibility 0 337 86
of 0 337 86
a 0 337 86
tragedy. 0 337 86

I 0 337 87
have 0 337 87
watched 0 337 87
Assange’s 0 337 87
health 0 337 87
deteriorate 0 337 87
in 0 337 87
his 0 337 87
years 0 337 87
of 0 337 87
confinement 0 337 87
without 0 337 87
sunlight. 0 337 87

He 0 337 88
has 0 337 88
had 0 337 88
a 0 337 88
relentless 0 337 88
cough, 0 337 88
but 0 337 88
is 0 337 88
not 0 337 88
even 0 337 88
allowed 0 337 88
safe 0 337 88
passage 0 337 88
to 0 337 88
and 0 337 88
from 0 337 88
a 0 337 88
hospital 0 337 88
for 0 337 88
an 0 337 88
X-ray. 0 337 88

Malcolm 1 337 89
Turnbull 1 337 89
can 1 337 89
remain 1 337 89
silent. 1 337 89

Or 1 337 90
he 1 337 90
can 1 337 90
seize 1 337 90
this 1 337 90
opportunity 1 337 90
and 1 337 90
use 1 337 90
his 1 337 90
government’s 1 337 90
diplomatic 1 337 90
influence 1 337 90
to 1 337 90
defend 1 337 90
the 1 337 90
life 1 337 90
of 1 337 90
an 1 337 90
Australian 1 337 90
citizen, 1 337 90
whose 1 337 90
courageous 1 337 90
public 1 337 90
service 1 337 90
is 1 337 90
recognised 1 337 90
by 1 337 90
countless 1 337 90
people 1 337 90
across 1 337 90
the 1 337 90
world. 1 337 90

He 0 337 91
can 0 337 91
bring 0 337 91
Julian 0 337 91
Assange 0 337 91
home. 0 337 91
