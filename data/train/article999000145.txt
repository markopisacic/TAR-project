for 0 34 17

the 0 34 17
words 0 34 17
"Speaker 1 34 17

off 0 34 17
our 0 34 17
lips, 0 34 17
Trump 0 34 17
also 0 34 17
said 0 34 17
that 0 34 17
a 0 34 17

incumbent 0 34 17
Democrat 0 34 17
Sen. 0 34 17
Joe 0 34 17

to 0 34 17
Senator 0 34 17
Chuck 0 34 17

becoming 0 34 17
the 0 34 17
Senate 0 34 17
Majority 0 34 17

The 0 34 18
president 0 34 18
also 0 34 18
pointed 0 34 18
out 0 34 18
that 0 34 18
Donnelly 0 34 18
had 0 34 18
opposed 0 34 18
tax 0 34 18
cuts 0 34 18

fellow 0 34 18

"The 0 34 19
people 0 34 19
of 0 34 19
Indiana 0 34 19
do 0 34 19
not 0 34 19
have 0 34 19
a 0 34 19
one-week 0 34 19
memory,” 0 34 19
said 0 34 19
Trump. 0 34 19

“That 0 34 20
was 0 34 20
a 0 34 20
disgrace 0 34 20
what 0 34 20
we 0 34 20
watched 0 34 20
up 0 34 20
there." 0 34 20

Additionally, 0 34 21
Trump 0 34 21
said 0 34 21
that 0 34 21
Donnelly 0 34 21
voted 0 34 21
to 0 34 21
provide 0 34 21
free 0 34 21
health 0 34 21
care 0 34 21
to 0 34 21
illegal 0 34 21
aliens 0 34 21
and 0 34 21
sponsored 0 34 21
Senator 0 34 21

Feinstein's 0 34 21
(D-CA) 0 34 21
"Open 0 34 21

Bill." 0 34 21

While 0 34 22
some 0 34 22
don't 0 34 22
believe 0 34 22
that 0 34 22
Trump's 1 34 22
base 1 34 22
is 1 34 22
all 1 34 22
that 1 34 22
energized, 1 34 22
it 1 34 22
seems 1 34 22
pretty 1 34 22
energetic 1 34 22
to 1 34 22
me 1 34 22
and 0 34 22
attacks 0 34 22
on 0 34 22
conservatives 0 34 22
on 0 34 22
social 0 34 22
media 0 34 22
and 0 34 22
in 0 34 22
search 0 34 22
engine 0 34 22
results 0 34 22
have 1 34 22
only 1 34 22
furthered 1 34 22
their 1 34 22
outrage 1 34 22
at 1 34 22
the 1 34 22
establishment, 1 34 22
both 0 34 22
Democrat 0 34 22
and 0 34 22
Republican. 0 34 22

We're 0 34 23
just 0 34 23
days 0 34 23
away 0 34 23
from 0 34 23
seeing 0 34 23
how 0 34 23
things 0 34 23
turn 0 34 23
out. 0 34 23

There's 0 34 24
a 0 34 24
part 0 34 24
of 0 34 24
me 0 34 24
that 0 34 24
thinks 0 34 24
this 0 34 24
may 0 34 24
actually 0 34 24
turn 0 34 24
out 0 34 24
to 0 34 24
be 0 34 24
one 0 34 24
of 0 34 24
the 0 34 24
biggest 0 34 24
turnouts 0 34 24
for 0 34 24
a 0 34 24
mid-term 0 34 24
election 0 34 24
that 0 34 24
we've 0 34 24
ever 0 34 24
seen, 0 34 24
but 0 34 24
that's 1 34 24
just 1 34 24
my 1 34 24
gut 1 34 24
feeling. 1 34 24

On 0 34 25
Tuesday, 0 34 25
we'll 0 34 25
know 0 34 25
for 0 34 25
sure. 0 34 25

I 0 34 26
don't 0 34 26
know 0 34 26
about 0 34 26
you, 0 34 26
but 0 34 26
I 0 34 26
didn't 0 34 26
actually 0 34 26
like 0 34 26
hearing 0 34 26
the 0 34 26
words 0 34 26
"Speaker 0 34 26
Paul 0 34 26
Ryan." 0 34 26

I 0 34 27
certainly 0 34 27
don't 0 34 27
want 0 34 27
to 0 34 27
hear 0 34 27
"Speaker 0 34 27
Pelosi," 0 34 27
again. 0 34 27
