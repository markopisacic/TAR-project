Victims 1 375 0

The 0 375 1
media 0 375 1
very 1 375 1
deliberately 1 375 1
misreported 0 375 1
the 0 375 1
Bundy 0 375 1
standoff, 0 375 1
ridiculing 1 375 1
the 0 375 1
men 0 375 1
involved 0 375 1
and 0 375 1
shrugging 1 375 1
at 1 375 1
the 1 375 1
murder 1 375 1
of 0 375 1
LaVoy 0 375 1
Finicum. 0 375 1

When 0 375 2
the 0 375 2
court 0 375 2
case 0 375 2
completely 1 375 2
collapsed, 1 375 2
the 0 375 2
media 0 375 2
buried 0 375 2
the 0 375 2
story. 0 375 2

Just 0 375 3
as 0 375 3
it 0 375 3
failed 0 375 3
to 0 375 3
provide 0 375 3
any 0 375 3
meaningful 0 375 3
information 0 375 3
about 0 375 3
the 0 375 3
background 0 375 3
of 0 375 3
the 0 375 3
case. 0 375 3

That 0 375 4
was 0 375 4
in 0 375 4
part 0 375 4
because 1 375 4
it 1 375 4
would 1 375 4
have 1 375 4
been 1 375 4
damaging 1 375 4
to 1 375 4
Obama. 1 375 4

And 0 375 5
because 0 375 5
they 0 375 5
didn't 0 375 5
care. 0 375 5

But 0 375 6
President 0 375 6
Trump 0 375 6
listened 0 375 6
to 0 375 6
the 0 375 6
voices 0 375 6
asking 0 375 6
him 0 375 6
for 0 375 6
justice. 0 375 6

The 0 375 9
evidence 0 375 9
at 0 375 9
trial 0 375 9
regarding 0 375 9
the 0 375 9
Hammonds’ 0 375 9
responsibility 0 375 9
for 0 375 9
the 0 375 9
fire 0 375 9
was 0 375 9
conflicting, 0 375 9
and 0 375 9
the 0 375 9
jury 0 375 9
acquitted 0 375 9
them 0 375 9
on 0 375 9
most 0 375 9
of 0 375 9
the 0 375 9
charges. 0 375 9

At 0 375 10
the 0 375 10
Hammonds’ 0 375 10
original 0 375 10
sentencing, 0 375 10
the 0 375 10
judge 0 375 10
noted 0 375 10
that 0 375 10
they 0 375 10
are 0 375 10
respected 0 375 10
in 0 375 10
the 0 375 10
community 0 375 10
and 0 375 10
that 0 375 10
imposing 0 375 10
the 0 375 10
mandatory 0 375 10
minimum, 0 375 10
5-year 0 375 10
prison 0 375 10
sentence 0 375 10
would 0 375 10
“shock 1 375 10
the 1 375 10
conscience” 1 375 10
and 0 375 10
be 0 375 10
“grossly 1 375 10
disproportionate 1 375 10
to 1 375 10
the 1 375 10
severity” 1 375 10
of 0 375 10
their 0 375 10
conduct. 0 375 10

As 0 375 11
a 0 375 11
result, 0 375 11
the 0 375 11
judge 0 375 11
imposed 0 375 11
significantly 0 375 11
lesser 0 375 11
sentences. 0 375 11

The 0 375 12
previous 0 375 12
administration, 0 375 12
however, 0 375 12
filed 0 375 12
an 0 375 12
overzealous 1 375 12
appeal 0 375 12
that 0 375 12
resulted 0 375 12
in 0 375 12
the 0 375 12
Hammonds 0 375 12
being 0 375 12
sentenced 0 375 12
to 0 375 12
five 0 375 12
years 0 375 12
in 0 375 12
prison. 0 375 12

This 0 375 13
was 0 375 13
unjust. 1 375 13

now 0 375 14

approximately 0 375 14
three 0 375 14
years 0 375 14
in 0 375 14
prison 0 375 14

The 0 375 15
same 0 375 15

that 0 375 15
was 0 375 15
against 0 375 15

minimums 0 375 15
for 0 375 15

drug 0 375 15

Antiterrorism 0 375 15

Act. 0 375 15

While 1 375 16
Obama 1 375 16
pardoned 1 375 16
drug 1 375 16
dealers 1 375 16
and 1 375 16
locked 1 375 16

pardons 1 375 16

Both 0 375 17

are 0 375 17
currently 0 375 17
in 0 375 17
prison 0 375 17
on 0 375 17
five-year 0 375 17
sentences, 0 375 17
thanks 0 375 17
in 0 375 17
part 0 375 17
to 0 375 17
a 0 375 17
1996 0 375 17
antiterrorism 0 375 17
law 0 375 17
that 0 375 17

on 0 375 17
certain 0 375 17
crimes 0 375 17
on 0 375 17
federal 0 375 17
land. 0 375 17

The 0 375 18
length 0 375 18
of 0 375 18
their 0 375 18
prison 0 375 18
terms, 0 375 18
in 0 375 18
part, 0 375 18
fueled 1 375 18
outrage 1 375 18
at 0 375 18
their 0 375 18
convictions. 0 375 18

Federal 0 375 19
Judge 0 375 19
Michael 0 375 19
Robert 0 375 19
Hogan 0 375 19
originally 0 375 19
gave 0 375 19
the 0 375 19

reduced 0 375 19
sentences 0 375 19
in 0 375 19
2012, 0 375 19
arguing 0 375 19
that 0 375 19
the 0 375 19
mandatory 0 375 19
minimums 0 375 19
were 0 375 19
unjust. 1 375 19

But 0 375 20
the 0 375 20

appealed, 0 375 20
and 0 375 20

Ann 0 375 20
Aiken 0 375 20

the 0 375 20
full 0 375 20
five-year 0 375 20
sentences. 0 375 20

Hogan 0 375 21

appointee 0 375 21
who 0 375 21
respected 0 375 21

Aiken 0 375 22
was 0 375 22
a 0 375 22
Dem 1 375 22
fundraiser, 1 375 22
her 0 375 22

Aiken 0 375 23
was 0 375 23
unqualified 1 375 23
for 0 375 23
her 0 375 23
role, 0 375 23
except 0 375 23
in 0 375 23
the 0 375 23
ways 0 375 23
that 0 375 23

their 0 375 23
