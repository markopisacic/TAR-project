Senator 0 199 1
Rand 0 199 1
Paul 0 199 1
(R-KY) 0 199 1
has 0 199 1
expressed 0 199 1
some 0 199 1
of 0 199 1
my 0 199 1
thoughts 0 199 1
when 0 199 1
it 0 199 1
comes 0 199 1
to 0 199 1
the 0 199 1
newly 0 199 1
nominated 0 199 1
Secretary 0 199 1
of 0 199 1

Paul 0 199 2
told 0 199 2
CNN’s 0 199 2
“State 0 199 2
of 0 199 2
the 0 199 2
Union” 0 199 2
and 0 199 2
CBS 0 199 2
News’ 0 199 2
“Face 0 199 2
the 0 199 2
Nation” 0 199 2
on 0 199 2
Sunday 0 199 2
that 0 199 2
he 0 199 2
would 0 199 2
do 0 199 2
"whatever 0 199 2
it 0 199 2
takes," 0 199 2
including 0 199 2
a 0 199 2
filibuster, 0 199 2
to 0 199 2
block 0 199 2
the 0 199 2
confirmations 0 199 2
of 0 199 2
Mike 0 199 2
Pompeo 0 199 2
to 0 199 2
head 0 199 2
the 0 199 2
State 0 199 2
Department 0 199 2
and 0 199 2
Gina 0 199 2
Haspel 0 199 2
to 0 199 2
run 0 199 2
the 0 199 2
CIA. 0 199 2

“You 1 199 3
really 1 199 3
want 1 199 3
a 1 199 3
diplomat 1 199 3
to 1 199 3
be 1 199 3
in 1 199 3
charge 1 199 3
of 1 199 3
the 1 199 3
State 1 199 3
Department, 1 199 3
not 1 199 3
someone 1 199 3
who 1 199 3
is 1 199 3
advocating 1 199 3
for 1 199 3
war,” 1 199 3
he 0 199 3
told 0 199 3
“Face 0 199 3
the 0 199 3
Nation.” 0 199 3

“I 0 199 4
frankly 0 199 4
think 0 199 4
that 0 199 4
Pompeo’s 0 199 4
positions 0 199 4
are 0 199 4
too 0 199 4
much 0 199 4
of 0 199 4
an 0 199 4
advocate 0 199 4
for 0 199 4
regime 0 199 4
change, 0 199 4
really 0 199 4
everywhere,” 0 199 4
he 0 199 4
added. 0 199 4

"I 0 199 5
don't 0 199 5
think 0 199 5
our 0 199 5
policy 0 199 5
ought 0 199 5
to 0 199 5
be 0 199 5
for 0 199 5
regime 0 199 5
change, 0 199 5
so 0 199 5
I 0 199 5
think 0 199 5
Pompeo 1 199 5
really 1 199 5
isn't 1 199 5
a 1 199 5
good 1 199 5
fit 1 199 5
to 1 199 5
be 1 199 5
a 1 199 5
diplomat." 1 199 5

He's 0 199 6
right, 0 199 6
too. 0 199 6

Pompeo 0 199 7
has 0 199 7
advocated 0 199 7
for 0 199 7
regime 0 199 7
change 0 199 7
in 0 199 7
North 0 199 7
Korea. 0 199 7

We've 0 199 8
seen 0 199 8
exactly 0 199 8
what 0 199 8
happens 0 199 8
when 0 199 8
the 0 199 8
US 0 199 8
gets 0 199 8
involved 0 199 8
in 0 199 8
such 0 199 8
types 0 199 8
of 0 199 8
regime 0 199 8
changes, 0 199 8
and 0 199 8
the 0 199 8
truth 0 199 8
is 0 199 8
that 0 199 8
they 0 199 8
really 0 199 8
don't 0 199 8
work 0 199 8
out 0 199 8
too 0 199 8
well. 0 199 8

As 0 199 9
for 0 199 9
Haspel, 0 199 9
Paul 0 199 9
told 0 199 9
"Face 0 199 9
The 0 199 9
Nation," 0 199 9
"She 0 199 9
oversaw 0 199 9
an 0 199 9
illegal 0 199 9
black 0 199 9
ops 0 199 9
operation 0 199 9
in 0 199 9
Thailand 0 199 9
that 0 199 9
included 0 199 9
torture. 0 199 9

I 1 199 10
don't 1 199 10
think 1 199 10
torture 1 199 10
is 1 199 10
what 1 199 10
America 1 199 10
is 1 199 10
about." 1 199 10

On 0 199 11
"State 0 199 11
of 0 199 11
the 0 199 11
Union," 0 199 11
Paul 0 199 11
added, 0 199 11
"I'll 0 199 11
do 0 199 11
whatever 0 199 11
it 0 199 11
takes, 0 199 11
and 0 199 11
that 0 199 11
includes 0 199 11
filibuster" 0 199 11
to 0 199 11
block 0 199 11
their 0 199 11
confirmation. 0 199 11

"I 0 199 12
don't 0 199 12
have 0 199 12
the 0 199 12
power 0 199 12
to 0 199 12
stop 0 199 12
her 0 199 12
nomination," 0 199 12
he 0 199 12
said 0 199 12
of 0 199 12
Haspel. 0 199 12

"There's 0 199 13
enough 0 199 13
votes 0 199 13
she'll 0 199 13
eventually 0 199 13
win. 0 199 13

Few 1 199 14
things 1 199 14
in 1 199 14
life 1 199 14
. 1 199 14

. 1 199 15

. 1 199 16

[are] 1 199 17
worth 1 199 17
standing 1 199 17
up 1 199 17
saying 0 199 17
'enough 1 199 17
is 1 199 17
enough.'" 1 199 17

"We 1 199 18
are 1 199 18
not 1 199 18
a 1 199 18
people 1 199 18
that 1 199 18
should 1 199 18
be 1 199 18
so 1 199 18
fearful 1 199 18
or 1 199 18
vengeful 1 199 18
that 1 199 18
we 1 199 18
think 1 199 18
that 1 199 18
torture 1 199 18
is 1 199 18
somehow 1 199 18
acceptable," 1 199 18
he 0 199 18
added. 0 199 18

"On 0 199 19
what 0 199 19
level 0 199 19
could 0 199 19
torture 0 199 19
ever 0 199 19
be 0 199 19
acceptable? 0 199 19

We 1 199 20
should 1 199 20
make 1 199 20
a 1 199 20
stand 1 199 20
on 1 199 20
this. 1 199 20

She 1 199 21
should 1 199 21
never 1 199 21
lead 1 199 21
the 1 199 21
CIA." 1 199 21

Both 0 199 22
nominations 0 199 22
may 0 199 22
face 0 199 22
tough 0 199 22
confirmation 0 199 22
hearings, 0 199 22
but 0 199 22
it 0 199 22
seems 0 199 22
that 0 199 22
many 1 199 22
Americans 1 199 22
are 1 199 22
just 1 199 22
fine 1 199 22
with 1 199 22
these 1 199 22
types 1 199 22
of 1 199 22
people 1 199 22
being 1 199 22
in 1 199 22
these 1 199 22
types 1 199 22
of 1 199 22
offices. 1 199 22

The 0 199 23
only 0 199 23
thing 0 199 23
I 0 199 23
can 0 199 23
think 0 199 23
for 0 199 23
that 0 199 23
kind 0 199 23
of 0 199 23
reasoning 0 199 23
is 0 199 23
that 0 199 23
people 1 199 23
do 1 199 23
not 1 199 23
know 1 199 23
their 1 199 23
Constitution 1 199 23
and 1 199 23
understand 1 199 23
exactly 1 199 23
what 1 199 23
Senator 1 199 23
Paul 1 199 23
is 1 199 23
trying 1 199 23
to 1 199 23
warn 1 199 23
America 1 199 23
about. 1 199 23

Instead, 0 199 24
people 0 199 24
are 0 199 24
acting 0 199 24
out 0 199 24
of 0 199 24
emotion 0 199 24
and 0 199 24
fear. 0 199 24

Do 0 199 25
I 0 199 25
believe 0 199 25
we 0 199 25
should 0 199 25
be 0 199 25
concerned 0 199 25
about 0 199 25
North 0 199 25
Korea? 0 199 25

Sure, 0 199 26
but 0 199 26
I'm 0 199 26
hardly 0 199 26
worried 0 199 26
that 0 199 26
they 0 199 26
will 0 199 26
actually 0 199 26
attack 0 199 26
us. 0 199 26

Am 0 199 27
I 0 199 27
concerned 0 199 27
about 0 199 27
jihadis? 0 199 27

Yep, 0 199 28
but 0 199 28
I'm 0 199 28
not 0 199 28
sure 0 199 28
I've 0 199 28
seen 0 199 28
any 0 199 28
real 0 199 28
hard 0 199 28
evidence 0 199 28
that 0 199 28
torturing 0 199 28
them 0 199 28
has 0 199 28
produced 0 199 28
any 0 199 28
information 0 199 28
that 0 199 28
has 0 199 28
led 0 199 28
to 0 199 28
stopping 0 199 28
terror 0 199 28
attacks. 0 199 28

And 0 199 29
before 0 199 29
you 0 199 29
tell 0 199 29
me 0 199 29
about 0 199 29
the 0 199 29
media 0 199 29
reports 0 199 29
and 0 199 29
CIA 0 199 29
involvement, 0 199 29
just 0 199 29
keep 0 199 29
in 0 199 29
mind 0 199 29
that 0 199 29
a 1 199 29
former 1 199 29
journalist, 1 199 29
who 1 199 29
is 1 199 29
now 1 199 29
dead, 1 199 29
told 1 199 29
the 1 199 29
world 1 199 29
that 1 199 29
the 1 199 29
media 1 199 29
lies 1 199 29
for 1 199 29
the 1 199 29
CIA. 1 199 29

So, 1 199 30
I'm 1 199 30
wary 1 199 30
of 1 199 30
media 1 199 30
reports 1 199 30
that 1 199 30
claim 1 199 30
there 1 199 30
have 1 199 30
been 1 199 30
results 1 199 30
from 1 199 30
the 1 199 30
tactics 1 199 30
used. 1 199 30

Trump 1 199 31
has 1 199 31
obviously 1 199 31
had 1 199 31
praise 1 199 31
for 1 199 31
both 1 199 31
Pompeo 1 199 31
and 1 199 31
Haspel, 1 199 31
but 1 199 31
then 1 199 31
again, 1 199 31
his 1 199 31
administration 1 199 31
has 1 199 31
quite 1 199 31
a 1 199 31
bit 1 199 31
of 1 199 31
turn 1 199 31
over 1 199 31
too. 1 199 31

Mike 0 199 32
Pompeo, 0 199 32
Director 0 199 32
of 0 199 32
the 0 199 32
CIA, 0 199 32
will 0 199 32
become 0 199 32
our 0 199 32
new 0 199 32
Secretary 0 199 32
of 0 199 32
State. 0 199 32

He 1 199 33
will 1 199 33
do 1 199 33
a 1 199 33
fantastic 1 199 33
job! 1 199 33

Thank 0 199 34
you 0 199 34
to 0 199 34
Rex 0 199 34
Tillerson 0 199 34
for 0 199 34
his 0 199 34
service! 0 199 34

Gina 0 199 35
Haspel 0 199 35
will 0 199 35
become 0 199 35
the 0 199 35
new 0 199 35
Director 0 199 35
of 0 199 35
the 0 199 35

and 0 199 35
the 0 199 35
first 0 199 35

chosen. 0 199 35
