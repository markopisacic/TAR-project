Rand 0
Paul: 0
I'll 0
Do 0
"Whatever 0
It 0
Takes" 0
To 0
Block 0
Haspel 0
& 0
Pompeo 0

Senator 0
Rand 0
Paul 0
(R-KY) 0
has 0
expressed 0
some 0
of 0
my 0
thoughts 0
when 0
it 0
comes 0
to 0
the 0
newly 0
nominated 0
Secretary 0
of 0
State 0
and 0
director 0
of 0
the 0
Central 0
Intelligence 0
Agency. 0

Paul 0
told 0
CNN’s 0
“State 0
of 0
the 0
Union” 0
and 0
CBS 0
News’ 0
“Face 0
the 0
Nation” 0
on 0
Sunday 0
that 0
he 0
would 0
do 0
"whatever 0
it 0
takes," 0
including 0
a 0
filibuster, 0
to 0
block 0
the 0
confirmations 0
of 0
Mike 0
Pompeo 0
to 0
head 0
the 0
State 0
Department 0
and 0
Gina 0
Haspel 0
to 0
run 0
the 0
CIA. 0

“You 1
really 1
want 1
a 1
diplomat 1
to 1
be 1
in 1
charge 1
of 1
the 1
State 1
Department, 1
not 1
someone 1
who 1
is 1
advocating 1
for 1
war,” 1
he 0
told 0
“Face 0
the 0
Nation.” 0

“I 0
frankly 0
think 0
that 0
Pompeo’s 0
positions 0
are 0
too 0
much 0
of 0
an 0
advocate 0
for 0
regime 0
change, 0
really 0
everywhere,” 0
he 0
added. 0

"I 0
don't 0
think 0
our 0
policy 0
ought 0
to 0
be 0
for 0
regime 0
change, 0
so 0
I 0
think 0
Pompeo 1
really 1
isn't 1
a 1
good 1
fit 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
diplomat." 1

He's 0
right, 0
too. 0

Pompeo 0
has 0
advocated 0
for 0
regime 0
change 0
in 0
North 0
Korea. 0

We've 0
seen 0
exactly 0
what 0
happens 0
when 0
the 0
US 0
gets 0
involved 0
in 0
such 0
types 0
of 0
regime 0
changes, 0
and 0
the 0
truth 0
is 0
that 0
they 0
really 0
don't 0
work 0
out 0
too 0
well. 0

As 0
for 0
Haspel, 0
Paul 0
told 0
"Face 0
The 0
Nation," 0
"She 0
oversaw 0
an 0
illegal 0
black 0
ops 0
operation 0
in 0
Thailand 0
that 0
included 0
torture. 0

I 1
don't 1
think 1
torture 1
is 1
what 1
America 1
is 1
about." 1

On 0
"State 0
of 0
the 0
Union," 0
Paul 0
added, 0
"I'll 0
do 0
whatever 0
it 0
takes, 0
and 0
that 0
includes 0
filibuster" 0
to 0
block 0
their 0
confirmation. 0

"I 0
don't 0
have 0
the 0
power 0
to 0
stop 0
her 0
nomination," 0
he 0
said 0
of 0
Haspel. 0

"There's 0
enough 0
votes 0
she'll 0
eventually 0
win. 0

Few 1
things 1
in 1
life 1
. 1

. 1

. 1

[are] 1
worth 1
standing 1
up 1
saying 0
'enough 1
is 1
enough.'" 1

"We 1
are 1
not 1
a 1
people 1
that 1
should 1
be 1
so 1
fearful 1
or 1
vengeful 1
that 1
we 1
think 1
that 1
torture 1
is 1
somehow 1
acceptable," 1
he 0
added. 0

"On 0
what 0
level 0
could 0
torture 0
ever 0
be 0
acceptable? 0

We 1
should 1
make 1
a 1
stand 1
on 1
this. 1

She 1
should 1
never 1
lead 1
the 1
CIA." 1

Both 0
nominations 0
may 0
face 0
tough 0
confirmation 0
hearings, 0
but 0
it 0
seems 0
that 0
many 1
Americans 1
are 1
just 1
fine 1
with 1
these 1
types 1
of 1
people 1
being 1
in 1
these 1
types 1
of 1
offices. 1

The 0
only 0
thing 0
I 0
can 0
think 0
for 0
that 0
kind 0
of 0
reasoning 0
is 0
that 0
people 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
their 1
Constitution 1
and 1
understand 1
exactly 1
what 1
Senator 1
Paul 1
is 1
trying 1
to 1
warn 1
America 1
about. 1

Instead, 0
people 0
are 0
acting 0
out 0
of 0
emotion 0
and 0
fear. 0

Do 0
I 0
believe 0
we 0
should 0
be 0
concerned 0
about 0
North 0
Korea? 0

Sure, 0
but 0
I'm 0
hardly 0
worried 0
that 0
they 0
will 0
actually 0
attack 0
us. 0

Am 0
I 0
concerned 0
about 0
jihadis? 0

Yep, 0
but 0
I'm 0
not 0
sure 0
I've 0
seen 0
any 0
real 0
hard 0
evidence 0
that 0
torturing 0
them 0
has 0
produced 0
any 0
information 0
that 0
has 0
led 0
to 0
stopping 0
terror 0
attacks. 0

And 0
before 0
you 0
tell 0
me 0
about 0
the 0
media 0
reports 0
and 0
CIA 0
involvement, 0
just 0
keep 0
in 0
mind 0
that 0
a 1
former 1
journalist, 1
who 1
is 1
now 1
dead, 1
told 1
the 1
world 1
that 1
the 1
media 1
lies 1
for 1
the 1
CIA. 1

So, 1
I'm 1
wary 1
of 1
media 1
reports 1
that 1
claim 1
there 1
have 1
been 1
results 1
from 1
the 1
tactics 1
used. 1

Trump 1
has 1
obviously 1
had 1
praise 1
for 1
both 1
Pompeo 1
and 1
Haspel, 1
but 1
then 1
again, 1
his 1
administration 1
has 1
quite 1
a 1
bit 1
of 1
turn 1
over 1
too. 1

Mike 0
Pompeo, 0
Director 0
of 0
the 0
CIA, 0
will 0
become 0
our 0
new 0
Secretary 0
of 0
State. 0

He 1
will 1
do 1
a 1
fantastic 1
job! 1

Thank 0
you 0
to 0
Rex 0
Tillerson 0
for 0
his 0
service! 0

Gina 0
Haspel 0
will 0
become 0
the 0
new 0
Director 0
of 0
the 0
CIA, 0
and 0
the 0
first 0
woman 0
so 0
chosen. 0

Congratulations 0
to 0
all! 0

We'll 0
see 0
how 0
things 0
turn 0
out 0
and 0
I'm 0
sure 0
Senator 0
Paul 0
is 0
not 0
issuing 0
an 0
empty 0
threat 0
in 0
the 0
matter. 0
