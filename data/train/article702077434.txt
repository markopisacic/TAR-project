Khweis 0 48 3

reasons. 0 48 3

His 0 48 7
life 0 48 7

to 0 48 10
join 0 48 10

him 0 48 12
to 0 48 12
travel 0 48 12
to 0 48 12

the 0 48 14
worst 0 48 14
decision 0 48 14
I 0 48 14
ever 0 48 14
made,” 0 48 14
Khweis 0 48 14

to 0 48 14
the 0 48 14
judge 0 48 14
in 0 48 14
a 0 48 14
letter. 0 48 14

“I 0 48 15
ruined 1 48 15
my 1 48 15
life 1 48 15
and 1 48 15
my 1 48 15
