Kate 0 2 1
Steinle 0 2 1
set 0 2 1
off 0 2 1
a 0 2 1
firestorm 1 2 1
of 1 2 1
outrage 1 2 1
Thursday 0 2 1
night, 0 2 1
as 0 2 1
top 0 2 1
conservatives 0 2 1
and 0 2 1
critics 0 2 1
of 0 2 1
so-called 0 2 1
"sanctuary 0 2 1
cities" 0 2 1
pinned 1 2 1
blame 1 2 1
for 1 2 1
Steinle's 1 2 1
death 1 2 1
on 1 2 1
illegal 1 2 1
immigration 1 2 1
and 1 2 1
insufficiently 1 2 1
aggressive 1 2 1

policies. 1 2 1

Garcia 0 2 2
Zarate, 0 2 2
a 0 2 2
45-year-old 0 2 2
Mexican 0 2 2
national 0 2 2
who 0 2 2
was 0 2 2
homeless 0 2 2
and 0 2 2
living 0 2 2
in 0 2 2
the 0 2 2
US 0 2 2
illegally 0 2 2
when 0 2 2
he 0 2 2
fired 0 2 2
the 0 2 2
shot 0 2 2
that 0 2 2
killed 0 2 2
Steinle, 0 2 2
was 0 2 2
acquitted 0 2 2
by 0 2 2
a 0 2 2
jury 0 2 2
on 0 2 2
murder 0 2 2
and 0 2 2
manslaughter 0 2 2
charges. 0 2 2

The 0 2 3
jury 0 2 3
convicted 0 2 3
him 0 2 3
of 0 2 3
the 0 2 3
lesser 0 2 3
charge 0 2 3
of 0 2 3
being 0 2 3
a 0 2 3
felon 0 2 3
in 0 2 3
possession 0 2 3
of 0 2 3
a 0 2 3
gun, 0 2 3
which 0 2 3
carries 0 2 3
a 0 2 3
maximum 0 2 3
sentence 0 2 3
of 0 2 3
three 0 2 3
years 0 2 3
in 0 2 3
state 0 2 3
prison. 0 2 3

Steinle, 0 2 4
32, 0 2 4
was 0 2 4
fatally 0 2 4
shot 0 2 4
while 0 2 4
she 0 2 4
walked 0 2 4
along 0 2 4
Pier 0 2 4
14 0 2 4
of 0 2 4
the 0 2 4
San 0 2 4
Francisco 0 2 4
Bay 0 2 4
with 0 2 4
her 0 2 4
father 0 2 4
in 0 2 4
July 0 2 4
2015. 0 2 4

The 0 2 5
bullet 0 2 5
that 0 2 5
pierced 0 2 5
her 0 2 5
back 0 2 5
had 0 2 5
ricocheted 0 2 5
off 0 2 5
the 0 2 5
concrete 0 2 5
ground 0 2 5
after 0 2 5
it 0 2 5
was 0 2 5
fired 0 2 5
by 0 2 5
Garcia 0 2 5
Zarate 0 2 5
from 0 2 5
a 0 2 5
handgun 0 2 5
belonging 0 2 5
to 0 2 5
a 0 2 5
federal 0 2 5
ranger 0 2 5
that 0 2 5
had 0 2 5
been 0 2 5
stolen 0 2 5
four 0 2 5
days 0 2 5
earlier. 0 2 5

Garcia 0 2 6
Zarate's 0 2 6
defense 0 2 6
attorneys 0 2 6
argued 0 2 6
that 0 2 6
the 0 2 6
shooting 0 2 6
was 0 2 6
an 0 2 6
accident 0 2 6
— 0 2 6
they 0 2 6
said 0 2 6
he 0 2 6
found 0 2 6
the 0 2 6
gun 0 2 6
wrapped 0 2 6
in 0 2 6
a 0 2 6
T-shirt 0 2 6
or 0 2 6
cloth 0 2 6
under 0 2 6
a 0 2 6
pier 0 2 6
bench 0 2 6
and 0 2 6
unintentionally 0 2 6
discharged 0 2 6

it. 0 2 7
Lead 0 2 7
attorney 0 2 7
Matt 0 2 7
Gonzalez 0 2 7
has 0 2 7
argued 0 2 7
that 0 2 7
the 0 2 7
weapon 0 2 7
was 0 2 7
a 0 2 7
SIG 0 2 7
Sauer 0 2 7
with 0 2 7
a 0 2 7
"hair 1 2 7
trigger 1 2 7
in 1 2 7
single-action 1 2 7
mode" 1 2 7
— 0 2 7
a 0 2 7
model 0 2 7
well-known 0 2 7
for 0 2 7
accidental 0 2 7
discharges 0 2 7
even 0 2 7
among 0 2 7
experienced 0 2 7
shooters. 0 2 7

Gonzalez 0 2 8
told 0 2 8
the 0 2 8
jury, 0 2 8
according 0 2 8
to 0 2 8
the 0 2 8
San 0 2 8
Francisco 0 2 8
Chronicle, 0 2 8
that 0 2 8
Garcia 0 2 8
Zarate 0 2 8
had 0 2 8
never 0 2 8
handled 0 2 8
a 0 2 8
firearm 0 2 8
before, 0 2 8
was 0 2 8
frightened 0 2 8
by 0 2 8
the 0 2 8
noise 0 2 8
of 0 2 8
the 0 2 8
gunshot, 0 2 8
then 0 2 8
flung 0 2 8
the 0 2 8
weapon 0 2 8
into 0 2 8
the 0 2 8
bay 0 2 8
where 0 2 8
it 0 2 8
was 0 2 8
later 0 2 8
found 0 2 8
by 0 2 8
a 0 2 8
diver. 0 2 8

Prosecutors, 0 2 9
however, 0 2 9
alleged 0 2 9
that 0 2 9
Garcia 0 2 9
Zarate 0 2 9
brought 0 2 9
the 0 2 9
weapon 0 2 9
to 0 2 9
the 0 2 9
pier 0 2 9
deliberately 0 2 9
to 0 2 9
do 0 2 9
harm, 0 2 9
and 0 2 9
intentionally 0 2 9
aimed 0 2 9
and 0 2 9
shot 0 2 9
Steinle 0 2 9
after 0 2 9
firmly 0 2 9
pulling 0 2 9
the 0 2 9
trigger. 0 2 9

They 0 2 10
said 0 2 10
Garcia 0 2 10
Zarate 0 2 10
then 0 2 10
threw 0 2 10
the 0 2 10
weapon 0 2 10
into 0 2 10
the 0 2 10
bay 0 2 10
and 0 2 10
fled 0 2 10
the 0 2 10
scene. 0 2 10

Beyond 0 2 11
the 0 2 11
shooting 0 2 11
itself, 0 2 11
perhaps 0 2 11
the 0 2 11
most 0 2 11
controversial 0 2 11
aspect 0 2 11
of 0 2 11
Garcia 0 2 11
Zarate's 0 2 11
case 0 2 11
involves 0 2 11
his 0 2 11
previous 0 2 11
criminal 0 2 11
activity 0 2 11
and 0 2 11
history 0 2 11
of 0 2 11
deportations, 0 2 11
and 0 2 11
how 0 2 11
San 0 2 11
Francisco 0 2 11
and 0 2 11
federal 0 2 11
authorities 0 2 11
handled 0 2 11
his 0 2 11
custody 0 2 11
before 0 2 11
he 0 2 11
ever 0 2 11
picked 0 2 11
up 0 2 11
the 0 2 11
gun 0 2 11
and 0 2 11
shot 0 2 11
Steinle. 0 2 11

At 0 2 12
the 0 2 12
time 0 2 12
of 0 2 12
Steinle's 0 2 12
death, 0 2 12
Garcia 0 2 12
Zarate 0 2 12
had 0 2 12
been 0 2 12
convicted 0 2 12
of 0 2 12
nonviolent 0 2 12
drug 0 2 12
crimes 0 2 12
and 0 2 12
deported 0 2 12
five 0 2 12
times 0 2 12
since 0 2 12
the 0 2 12
early 0 2 12
1990s. 0 2 12

He 0 2 13
faced 0 2 13
a 0 2 13
sixth 0 2 13
deportation 0 2 13
in 0 2 13
2015, 0 2 13
and 0 2 13
was 0 2 13
in 0 2 13
Justice 0 2 13
Department 0 2 13
(DOJ) 0 2 13
custody 0 2 13
that 0 2 13
March 0 2 13
after 0 2 13
serving 0 2 13
46 0 2 13
months 0 2 13
in 0 2 13
prison 0 2 13
for 0 2 13
a 0 2 13
felony 0 2 13
re-entry 0 2 13
into 0 2 13
the 0 2 13
US, 0 2 13
but 0 2 13
instead 0 2 13
of 0 2 13
transferring 0 2 13
him 0 2 13
into 0 2 13
the 0 2 13
custody 0 2 13
of 0 2 13
Immigration 0 2 13
and 0 2 13
Customs 0 2 13
Enforcement 0 2 13
(ICE) 0 2 13
for 0 2 13
deportation, 0 2 13
the 0 2 13
department 0 2 13
transferred 0 2 13
him 0 2 13
to 0 2 13
the 0 2 13
San 0 2 13
Francisco 0 2 13
County 0 2 13
Jail 0 2 13
for 0 2 13
prosecution 0 2 13
of 0 2 13
a 0 2 13
1995 0 2 13
marijuana 0 2 13
charge. 0 2 13

San 0 2 14
Francisco 0 2 14
prosecutors, 0 2 14
who 0 2 14
had 0 2 14
long 0 2 14
ago 0 2 14
deprioritized 0 2 14
marijuana 0 2 14
charges, 0 2 14
dismissed 0 2 14
the 0 2 14
decades-old 0 2 14
charge 0 2 14
and 0 2 14
released 0 2 14
Garcia 0 2 14
Zarate 0 2 14
on 0 2 14
April 0 2 14
15, 0 2 14

2015. 0 2 15
Due 0 2 15
to 0 2 15
San 0 2 15
Francisco's 0 2 15
policy 0 2 15
of 0 2 15
limiting 0 2 15
cooperation 0 2 15
with 0 2 15
federal 0 2 15
immigration 0 2 15
authorities 0 2 15
— 0 2 15
which 0 2 15
some 0 2 15
refer 0 2 15
to 0 2 15
as 0 2 15
a 0 2 15
"sanctuary" 1 2 15
policy 1 2 15
— 0 2 15
the 0 2 15
city 0 2 15
did 0 2 15
not 0 2 15
inform 0 2 15
ICE 0 2 15
when 0 2 15
they 0 2 15
released 0 2 15
Garcia 0 2 15

Zarate. 0 2 16
As 0 2 16
a 0 2 16
result 0 2 16
of 0 2 16
the 0 2 16
case, 0 2 16
both 0 2 16
the 0 2 16
DOJ 0 2 16
and 0 2 16
the 0 2 16
city 0 2 16
of 0 2 16
San 0 2 16
Francisco 0 2 16
have 0 2 16
changed 0 2 16
several 0 2 16
policies. 0 2 16

The 0 2 17
DOJ 0 2 17
announced 0 2 17
in 0 2 17
2016 0 2 17
it 0 2 17
would 0 2 17
no 0 2 17
longer 0 2 17
release 0 2 17
potentially 0 2 17
deportable 0 2 17
detainees 0 2 17
to 0 2 17
local 0 2 17
jails 0 2 17
without 0 2 17
first 0 2 17
allowing 0 2 17
ICE 0 2 17
to 0 2 17
take 0 2 17

custody. 0 2 18
San 0 2 18
Francisco, 0 2 18
meanwhile, 0 2 18
has 0 2 18
adjusted 0 2 18
its 0 2 18
policy 0 2 18
to 0 2 18
notify 0 2 18
ICE 0 2 18
if 0 2 18
they 0 2 18
are 0 2 18
releasing 0 2 18
suspected 0 2 18
undocumented 0 2 18
immigrants 0 2 18
who 0 2 18
face 0 2 18
charges 0 2 18
of 0 2 18
serious 0 2 18
or 0 2 18
violent 0 2 18
felonies. 0 2 18

"This 1 2 19
tragedy 1 2 19
could 1 2 19
have 1 2 19
been 1 2 19
prevented 1 2 19
if 1 2 19
San 1 2 19
Francisco 1 2 19
had 1 2 19
simply 1 2 19
turned 1 2 19
the 1 2 19
alien 1 2 19
over 1 2 19
to 1 2 19
ICE 1 2 19
as 1 2 19
we 1 2 19
requested, 1 2 19
instead 1 2 19
of 1 2 19
releasing 1 2 19
him 1 2 19
back 1 2 19
onto 1 2 19
the 1 2 19
streets," 1 2 19
ICE 0 2 19
Director 0 2 19
Thomas 0 2 19
Homan 0 2 19
said 0 2 19
in 0 2 19
a 0 2 19
statement 0 2 19
on 0 2 19

Thursday. 0 2 20
"It 0 2 20
is 0 2 20
unconscionable 0 2 20
that 0 2 20
politicians 1 2 20
across 1 2 20
this 1 2 20
country 1 2 20
continue 1 2 20
to 1 2 20
endanger 1 2 20
the 1 2 20
lives 1 2 20
of 1 2 20
Americans 1 2 20
with 1 2 20
sanctuary 1 2 20
policies 1 2 20
while 1 2 20
ignoring 1 2 20
the 1 2 20
harm 1 2 20
inflicted 1 2 20
on 1 2 20
their 1 2 20
constituents." 1 2 20

But 0 2 21
ICE 0 2 21
has 0 2 21
faced 0 2 21
criticism 0 2 21
of 0 2 21
its 0 2 21
own 0 2 21
over 0 2 21
not 0 2 21
seeking 0 2 21
a 0 2 21
judicial 0 2 21
warrant 0 2 21
to 0 2 21
legally 0 2 21
obtain 0 2 21
custody 0 2 21
of 0 2 21
Garcia 0 2 21
Zarate 0 2 21
when 0 2 21
it 0 2 21
discovered 0 2 21
he 0 2 21
had 0 2 21
been 0 2 21
transferred 0 2 21
into 0 2 21
San 0 2 21
Francisco's 0 2 21

custody. 0 2 22
The 0 2 22
agency 0 2 22
has 0 2 22
argued 0 2 22
that 0 2 22
obtaining 0 2 22
judicial 0 2 22
warrants 0 2 22
are 0 2 22
unnecessary 0 2 22
and 0 2 22
would 0 2 22
place 0 2 22
too 0 2 22
much 0 2 22
burden 0 2 22
on 0 2 22
ICE 0 2 22
officials 0 2 22
and 0 2 22
federal 0 2 22

courts. 0 2 23
Though 0 2 23
the 0 2 23
agency 0 2 23
did 0 2 23
issue 0 2 23
a 0 2 23
request 0 2 23
to 0 2 23
the 0 2 23
city 0 2 23
to 0 2 23
detain 0 2 23
Garcia 0 2 23
Zarate 0 2 23
until 0 2 23
ICE 0 2 23
officials 0 2 23
could 0 2 23
pick 0 2 23
him 0 2 23
up, 0 2 23
their 0 2 23
detainer 0 2 23
requests 0 2 23
are 0 2 23
not 0 2 23
signed 0 2 23
by 0 2 23
a 0 2 23
judge 0 2 23
and 0 2 23
are 0 2 23
therefore 0 2 23
not 0 2 23
legally 0 2 23

binding. 0 2 24
San 0 2 24
Francisco's 0 2 24
policy 0 2 24
is 0 2 24
to 0 2 24
ignore 0 2 24
such 0 2 24
requests 0 2 24
if 0 2 24
they 0 2 24
are 0 2 24
not 0 2 24
accompanied 0 2 24
by 0 2 24
judge-signed 0 2 24
warrants, 0 2 24
and 0 2 24
the 0 2 24
city 0 2 24
has 0 2 24
cited 0 2 24
federal 0 2 24
court 0 2 24
cases 0 2 24
concluding 0 2 24
that 0 2 24
such 0 2 24
detentions 0 2 24
violate 0 2 24
inmates' 0 2 24
Fourth 0 2 24
Amendment 0 2 24

rights. 0 2 25
Garcia 0 2 25
Zarate's 0 2 25
deportation 0 2 25
and 0 2 25
criminal 0 2 25
history 0 2 25
made 0 2 25
him 0 2 25
an 0 2 25
effective 0 2 25
target 0 2 25
for 0 2 25
immigration 0 2 25
hardliners, 0 2 25
who 0 2 25
argued 0 2 25
that 0 2 25
Steinle 1 2 25
would 1 2 25
still 1 2 25
be 1 2 25
alive 1 2 25
were 1 2 25
it 1 2 25
not 1 2 25
for 1 2 25
an 1 2 25
insecure 1 2 25
border 1 2 25
and 1 2 25
lenient 1 2 25
treatment 1 2 25
toward 1 2 25
suspected 1 2 25
undocumented 1 2 25
immigrants 1 2 25
in 1 2 25

local 1 2 26
jails. 1 2 26
President 0 2 26
Donald 0 2 26
Trump 0 2 26
immediately 0 2 26
seized 0 2 26
on 0 2 26
the 0 2 26
verdict 0 2 26
on 0 2 26
Thursday 0 2 26
as 0 2 26
evidence 0 2 26
of 0 2 26
the 0 2 26
perils 0 2 26
of 0 2 26
"Illegal 0 2 26
Immigration." 0 2 26

Trump 0 2 27
