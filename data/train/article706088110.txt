to 0 301 1
the 0 301 1
United 0 301 1
States 0 301 1
and 0 301 1
submitted 0 301 1
asylum 0 301 1
applications. 0 301 1

Those 0 301 2
asylum 0 301 2

were 0 301 2
reviewed 0 301 2
by 0 301 2

The 0 301 3
claims 0 301 3
were 0 301 3
rejected 0 301 3
as 0 301 3
unsubstantiated 0 301 3
and 0 301 3
the 0 301 3
illegal 0 301 3

ordered 0 301 3

However, 0 301 4

Department 0 301 4
of 0 301 4

called 0 301 4

During 0 301 5
the 0 301 5
10 0 301 5
or 0 301 5
so 0 301 5
years 0 301 5
that 0 301 5
the 0 301 5
cases 0 301 5
involving 0 301 5
Indonesian 0 301 5

to 0 301 5
remain 0 301 5
in 0 301 5
the 0 301 5
United 0 301 5
States, 0 301 5
those 0 301 5
illegal 0 301 5

did 0 301 5
not 0 301 5
make 0 301 5

to 0 301 5
appeal 0 301 5
their 0 301 5
outstanding 0 301 5
orders. 0 301 5

Then 0 301 6
the 0 301 6
United 0 301 6
States 0 301 6
had 0 301 6
an 0 301 6
election, 0 301 6
and 0 301 6
the 0 301 6

Then 0 301 7
suddenly, 0 301 7
those 0 301 7

First, 0 301 15
let's 0 301 15
deal 0 301 15
with 0 301 15
the 0 301 15
misleading 0 301 15
reporting. 0 301 15

Rombot 0 301 16
was 0 301 16
not 0 301 16
taken 0 301 16
into 0 301 16
custody 0 301 16
based 0 301 16
on 0 301 16
any 0 301 16

of 0 301 16

all 0 301 16

Rombot 0 301 17
was 0 301 17
taken 0 301 17
into 0 301 17
custody 0 301 17
because 0 301 17
he 0 301 17
had 0 301 17
an 0 301 17
outstanding 0 301 17
Final 0 301 17
Order 0 301 17
Of 0 301 17
Removal; 0 301 17
that's 1 301 17
a 1 301 17
big 1 301 17
difference 1 301 17
and 1 301 17
symptomatic 1 301 17
of 1 301 17
the 1 301 17
lies 1 301 17
from 1 301 17
reporters 1 301 17
like 1 301 17
Raymond. 1 301 17

Saris 0 301 18
previously 0 301 18
ordered 0 301 18
a 0 301 18
stay 0 301 18
to 0 301 18
the 0 301 18
deportations. 0 301 18

She 0 301 19
is 0 301 19
currently 0 301 19
weighing 0 301 19
whether 0 301 19
she 0 301 19
can 0 301 19
order 0 301 19
a 0 301 19
longer 0 301 19
delay 0 301 19
to 0 301 19
give 0 301 19
the 0 301 19
affected 0 301 19
people 0 301 19
time 0 301 19
to 0 301 19
renew 0 301 19
their 0 301 19
efforts 0 301 19
to 0 301 19
gain 0 301 19
legal 0 301 19
status. 0 301 19

Now, 0 301 20
with 0 301 20
regard 0 301 20
to 0 301 20
Saris, 0 301 20
she 0 301 20
has 0 301 20
no 0 301 20
authority 0 301 20
to 0 301 20
interfere 0 301 20
with 0 301 20
the 0 301 20
pre-deportation 0 301 20
custody 0 301 20
of 0 301 20
an 0 301 20
illegal 1 301 20
alien 1 301 20
with 0 301 20
a 0 301 20
Final 0 301 20
Order 0 301 20
Of 0 301 20
Removal. 0 301 20

Rombot 0 301 21
was 0 301 21
taken 0 301 21
into 0 301 21
custody 0 301 21
because 0 301 21
he 0 301 21
was 0 301 21
soon 0 301 21
to 0 301 21
be 0 301 21
deported. 0 301 21

There 0 301 22
was 0 301 22
no 0 301 22
issue 0 301 22
of 0 301 22
Indonesia 0 301 22
not 0 301 22
accepting 0 301 22
him 0 301 22
nor 0 301 22
of 0 301 22
Indonesia 0 301 22
not 0 301 22
providing 0 301 22
a 0 301 22
travel 0 301 22
document, 0 301 22
so 0 301 22
there 0 301 22
was 0 301 22
no 0 301 22
question 0 301 22
of 0 301 22
him 0 301 22
being 0 301 22
held 0 301 22
in 0 301 22
custody 0 301 22
longer 0 301 22
than 0 301 22
allowed 0 301 22
in 0 301 22
the 0 301 22
St. 0 301 22
Cyr 0 301 22
decision 0 301 22
that 0 301 22
restricted 0 301 22
custody 0 301 22
of 0 301 22
illegal 1 301 22
aliens 1 301 22
with 0 301 22
Final 0 301 22
Orders 0 301 22
Of 0 301 22

who 0 301 22
for 0 301 22
whatever 0 301 22
reason 0 301 22
were 0 301 22
unlikely 0 301 22
to 0 301 22
be 0 301 22
successfully 0 301 22
deported. 0 301 22

She 0 301 23
still 0 301 23
thinks 0 301 23
that 0 301 23
she 0 301 23
can 0 301 23
review 0 301 23
the 0 301 23

more 0 301 23

aided 0 301 23

to 0 301 23
escape 0 301 23

when 0 301 23
she 0 301 23
let 0 301 23

alien 1 301 23
leave 0 301 23

through 0 301 23
the 0 301 23
