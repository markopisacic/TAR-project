Years 0
ago 0
numerous 0
Indonesian 0
Christians 0
came 0
illegally 0
to 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
and 0
submitted 0
asylum 0
applications. 0

Those 0
asylum 0
applications 0
were 0
reviewed 0
by 0
the 0
Executive 0
Office 0
for 0
Immigration 0
Review 0
(EOIR), 0
the 0
immigration 0
courts. 0

The 0
claims 0
were 0
rejected 0
as 0
unsubstantiated 0
and 0
the 0
illegal 0
aliens 0
ordered 0
deported. 0

However, 0
the 0
Department 0
of 0
Homeland 0
Security 0
(DHS) 0
declined 0
to 0
enforce 0
those 0
deportation 0
orders, 0
called 0
Final 0
Order 0
Of 0
Removal 0

During 0
the 0
10 0
or 0
so 0
years 0
that 0
the 0
cases 0
involving 0
Indonesian 0
Christians 0
were 0
free 0
to 0
remain 0
in 0
the 0
United 0
States, 0
those 0
illegal 0
aliens 0
did 0
not 0
make 0
any 0
effort 0
to 0
appeal 0
their 0
outstanding 0
orders. 0

Then 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
had 0
an 0
election, 0
and 0
the 0
policy 0
of 0
not 0
enforcing 0
those 0
and 0
many 0
other 0
Final 0
Orders 0
of 0
Removal 0
was 0
ended. 0

Then 0
suddenly, 0
those 0
illegal 1
aliens 1
claimed 0
they 0
were 0
being 0
denied 0
an 0
opportunity 0
to 0
file 0
for 0
asylum 0
or 0
were 0
not 0
receiving 0
due 0
process. 0

They 0
filed 0
a 0
case 0
in 0
the 0
Federal 0
courts 0
and 0
were 0
assigned 0
to 0
a 0
Kritarch, 0
Patti 0
Saris, 0
who 1
apparently 1
thinks 1
she 1
runs 1
immigration 1
policy, 1
even 0
after 0
aliens 1
have 0
had 0
their 0
day 0
in 0
court. 0

Saris 1
thinks 1
she 1
can 1
usurp 1
the 1
Constitution 1
of 1
the 1
United 1
States 1
based 1
on 1
her 1
whims 1
regarding 1
immigration 1
policy. 1

Patti 0
Saris 0

In 0
her 0
latest 0
excursion 0
into 0
immigration 0
enforcement 0
policy, 0
she 0
decided 0
that 0
illegal 1
aliens 1
can't 0
be 0
held 0
in 0
custody 0
for 0
their 0
return 0

BOSTON 0
(Reuters) 0
- 0
A 0
U.S. 0
judge 0
on 0
Wednesday 0
ordered 0
the 0
release 0
of 0
an 0
illegal 0
immigrant 0
who 0
is 0
among 0
47 0
Indonesians 0
in 0
New 0
Hampshire 0
challenging 0
the 0
Trump 0
administrationâ€™s 0
order 0
to 0
deport 0
them. 0

The 0
man, 0
Terry 0
Rombot, 0
had 0
been 0
allowed 0
to 0
remain 0
under 0
the 0
terms 0
of 0
a 0
2010 0
deal 0
with 0
U.S. 0
Immigration 0
and 0
Customs 0
Enforcement 0
until 0
this 0
year, 0
when 0
President 0
Donald 0
Trump 0
instructed 0
ICE 0
that 0
all 0
people 0
living 0
in 0
the 0
United 0

illegally 0
were 0
subject 0
to 0

Held 0

2017] 0

First, 0
let's 0
deal 0
with 0
the 0
misleading 0
reporting. 0

Rombot 0
was 0
not 0
taken 0
into 0
custody 0
based 0
on 0
any 0
ICE 0
policy 0
of 0
deporting 0
all 0
illegal 1
aliens. 1

Rombot 0
was 0
taken 0
into 0
custody 0
because 0
he 0
had 0
an 0
outstanding 0
Final 0
Order 0
Of 0
Removal; 0
that's 1
a 1
big 1
difference 1
and 1
symptomatic 1
of 1
the 1
lies 1
from 1
reporters 1
like 1
Raymond. 1

Saris 0
previously 0
ordered 0
a 0
stay 0
to 0
the 0
deportations. 0

She 0
is 0
currently 0
weighing 0
whether 0
she 0
can 0
order 0
a 0
longer 0
delay 0
to 0
give 0
the 0
affected 0
people 0
time 0
to 0
renew 0
their 0
efforts 0
to 0
gain 0
legal 0
status. 0

Now, 0
with 0
regard 0
to 0
Saris, 0
she 0
has 0
no 0
authority 0
to 0
interfere 0
with 0
the 0
pre-deportation 0
custody 0
of 0
an 0
illegal 1
alien 1
with 0
a 0
Final 0
Order 0
Of 0
Removal. 0

Rombot 0
was 0
taken 0
into 0
custody 0
because 0
he 0
was 0
soon 0
to 0
be 0
deported. 0

There 0
was 0
no 0
issue 0
of 0
Indonesia 0
not 0
accepting 0
him 0
nor 0
of 0
Indonesia 0
not 0
providing 0
a 0
travel 0
document, 0
so 0
there 0
was 0
no 0
question 0
of 0
him 0
being 0
held 0
in 0
custody 0
longer 0
than 0
allowed 0
in 0
the 0
St. 0
Cyr 0
decision 0
that 0
restricted 0
custody 0
of 0
illegal 1
aliens 1
with 0
Final 0
Orders 0
Of 0
Removal 0
who 0
for 0
whatever 0
reason 0
were 0
unlikely 0
to 0
be 0
successfully 0
deported. 0

She 0
still 0
thinks 0
that 0
she 0
can 0
review 0
the 0
underlying 0
decision 0
of 0
the 0
immigration 0
court 0
as 0
well.In 0
fact, 0
Saris' 0
actions 0
appear 0
to 0
more 0
akin 0
to 0
that 0
of 0
the 0
Mexican 0
kritarch 0
Monica 0
Herranz 0
who 0
aided 0
an 0
illegal 1
alien 1
to 0
escape 0
arrest 0
by 0
ICE 0
when 0
she 0
let 0
that 0
illegal 1
alien 1
leave 0
her 0
courtroom 0
through 0
the 0
exit 0
to 0
her 0
judicial 0
chambers. 0

Saris 0
is 0
clearly 0
scheming 0
to 0
help 0
Rombot 0
escape 0
deportation 0
by 0
disappearing 0
into 0
the 0
almost 0
1 0
million 0
illegal 1
aliens 1
absconding 0
from 0
Final 0
Orders 0
of 0
Removal 0

Time 1
for 1
Congress 1
to 1
impeach 1
Saris 1
and 1
to 1
remove 1
authority 1
from 1
lesser 1
courts 1
to 0
review 0
immigration 0
law 0
enforcement, 0
detention, 0
and 0
deportation 0
decisions. 0
