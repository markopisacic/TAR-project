Pope 0
Francis 0
vs 0
Contemplative 0
Orders 0

The 0
Francis 0
Vatican’s 0
approach 0
to 0
the 0
contemplative 0
life 0
is 0
probably 0
the 0
most 0
illustrative 0
of 0
our 0
entire 0
crisis. 0

Contemplative 0
life 0
is 0
aimed 0
only 0
at 0
a 0
purely 0
supernatural 0
end. 0

It 0
has 0
no 0
“use” 0
in 0
the 0
sense 0
that 0
either 0
the 0
Bergoglians 0
– 0
in 0
terms 0
of 0
their 0
political 0
machinations 0
– 0
or 0
the 0
world 0
can 0
understand. 0

There 0
is 0
probably 0
no 0
other 0
place 0
where 0
the 0
differences 0
between 0
the 0
two 0
programmes 0
- 0
the 0
Catholic 0
programme 0
of 0
Christ 0
and 0
the 0
Bergoglian/Kasperian 0
programme 0
- 0
are 0
more 0
sharply 0
contrasted. 0

One 0
aspect 0
of 0
Pope 0
Francis’ 0
character 0
that 0
seems 0
little-explored 0
by 0
the 0
Catholic 0
and 0
secular 0
media 0
alike 0
is 0
his 0
apparent 0
disdain 0
for 0
contemplative 0
religious 0
life 0
– 0
a 0
facet 0
of 0
Catholic 0
life 0
that 0
could 0
be 0
described 0
as 0
the 0
most 0
purely 0
religious 0
of 0
all 0
the 0
Church’s 0
undertakings. 0

The 0
world 0
does 0
not 0
understand 0
it 0
or 0
want 0
it. 0

Therefore, 0
it 0
is 0
something 0
of 0
a 0
thorn 0
in 0
the 0
Bergoglian 0
side, 0
and 0
he 0
has 0
repeatedly 0
expressed 0
his 0
contempt 0
for 0
it. 0

So 0
when, 0
in 0
2016 0
he 0
issued 0
a 0
document 0
on 0
contemplative 0
nuns, 0
the 0
faithful 0
braced 0
for 0
impact 0
. 0

In 0
his 0
recent 0
document, 0
ostensibly 0
on 0
holiness, 0
“Gaudete 0
et 0
Exultate,” 0
the 0
pope 0
attacked 1
the 0
religious 0
desire 0
for 0
silence 0
and 0
solitude, 0
to 0
be 0
alone 0
with 0
God 0
in 0
prayer, 0
seeking 0
unity 0
with 0
Him, 0
saying 0
in 0
essence 0
that 0
the 0
Christian 0
life 0
is 0
inherently 0
about 0
social 0
activism, 0
about 0
material, 0
worldly 0
ends. 0

To 0
these 0
foundations 0
of 0
the 0
contemplative 0
life 0
– 0
indeed 0
of 0
any 0
form 0
of 0
religious 0
life 0
in 0
the 0
Church 0
– 0
Francis 0
set 0
up 0
another 0
of 0
his 0
false 1
dichotomies, 0
contemplation 0
in 0
opposition 0
to 0
serving 0
others, 0
giving 0
a 0
Jesuit 0
maxim 0
as 0
an 0
imperative 0
for 0
all 0
Catholics: 0
“We 0
are 0
called 0
to 0
be 0
contemplatives 0
even 0
in 0
the 0
midst 0
of 0
action, 0
and 0
to 0
grow 0
in 0
holiness 0
by 0
responsibly 0
and 0
generously 0
carrying 0
out 0
our 0
proper 0
mission.” 0

Italian 0
Vaticanist 0
Marco 0
Tosatti 0
commented 0
dryly, 0
“Rejoice 0
and 0
be 0
glad… 0
but 0
not 0
if 0
you’re 0
a 0
cloistered 0
contemplative.” 0

In 0
2016, 0
I 0
wrote 0
that 0
Francis’ 0
Apostolic 0
Constitution, 0
“Vultum 0
dei 0
quaerere” 0
was 0
in 0
some 0
respects 0
the 1
most 1
damaging 1
object 0
of 0
the 0
wrecking-ball 1
pontificate 0
to 0
date. 0

Unfortunately, 0
it 0
was 0
about 0
a 0
subject 0
that 0
the 0
world, 0
and 0
therefore 0
the 0
modern 0
Church, 0
cares 0
so 0
little 0
about 0
that 0
hardly 0
anyone 0
noticed. 0

Aimed 0
specifically 0
at 0
female 0
contemplative 0
religious, 0
the 0
document 0
threatened 0
that 0
in 0
a 0
year 0
or 0
so 0
another 0
would 0
be 0
forthcoming 0
laying 0
out 0
precisely 0
what 0
would 0
now 0
be 0
required 0
of 0
nuns 0
to 0
continue 0
in 0
their 0
vocations. 0

The 0
new 0
document 0
issued 0
last 0
week, 0
“Cor 0
orans,” 0
is 0
juridical, 0
that 0
is, 0
it 0
is 0
not 0
much 0
more 0
than 0
a 0
list 0
of 0
specific 0
norms, 0
or 0
rules 0
– 0
289 0
of 0
them! 0

– 0
that 0
all 0
communities 0
of 0
contemplative 0
nuns 0
must 0
now 0
follow. 0

One 0
odd 0
remark 0
in 0
article 0
19 0
is 0
maybe 0
the 0
most 0
succinct 0
description 0
of 0
the 0
direction 0
planned 0
for 0
contemplatives: 0

“A 0
monastery 0
of 0
nuns, 0
as 0
every 0
religious 0
house, 0
is 0
erected 0
while 0
keeping 0
in 0
mind 0
its 0
usefulness 0
for 0
the 0
Church 0
and 0
for 0
the 0
Institute.” 0
(emphasis 0
added) 0

Wait… 0
its 0
“usefulness”? 0

I 0
think 0
a 0
fair 0
question 0
for 0
the 0
Faithful 0
to 0
ask 0
this 0
Vatican 0
department 0
might 0
be, 0
“According 0
to 0
what 0
specific 0
criteria 0
is 0
a 0
monastery’s 0
‘usefulness’ 0
actually 0
determined?” 0

One 0
can’t 0
help 0
but 0
hearken 0
back 0
to 0
the 0
criteria 0
for 0
monasteries 0
that 0
were 0
allowed 0
to 0
survive 0
the 0
revolutionary 0
purges 0
in 0
18th 0
and 0
19th 0
century 0
Europe. 0

A 0
house 0
that 0
could 0
prove 0
to 0
the 0
secularists 0
that 0
it 0
was 0
“useful” 0
– 0
that 0
it 0
could 0
care 0
for 0
the 0
indigent 0
elderly, 0
teach 0
children 0
or 0
nurse 0
the 0
sick 0
– 0
would 0
be 0
allowed 0
to 0
continue. 0

Those 0
which 0
were 0
purely 0
contemplative 0
– 0
a 0
single-minded 0
devotion 0
to 0
the 0
adoration 0
of 0
God 0
– 0
were 0
closed. 0

It 0
is 0
not 0
an 0
insignificant 0
quirk 0
of 0
modern 0
history, 0
and 0
one 0
that 0
tells 0
us 0
much 0
about 0
the 0
nature 0
of 0
the 0
current 0
pontificate, 0
that 0
houses 0
of 0
contemplatives 0
are 0
always 0
attacked 0
by 0
secularist 0
regimes, 0
from 1
Henry 1
VIII 1
to 1
the 1
Soviet 1
Union. 1

Rupture? 0

What 0
rupture? 0

The 0
first 0
thing 0
Cor 0
orans 0
does 0
is 0
claim 0
continuity 0
with 0
both 0
pre 0
and 0
post-Vatican 0
II 0
theology. 0

In 0
the 0
Introduction, 0
it 0
seems 0
anxious 0
to 0
establish 0
a 0
“hermeneutic 0
of 0
continuity” 0
with 0
Pius 0
XII 0
and 0
his 0
document 0
Sponsa 0
Christi 0
Ecclesia 0
of 0
1950. 0

The 0
authors 0
insist 0
there 0
is 0
no 0
contradiction 0
between 0
the 0
two 0
– 0
except, 0
of 0
course, 0
where 0
there 0
are 0
contradictions 0
– 0
and 0
that 0
both 0
Pius 0
XII 0
and 0
Francis 0
are 0
keen 0
to 0
see 0
nuns 0
reaching 0
the 0
“aim 0
of 0
their 0
specific 0
vocation.” 0
It 0
describes 0
Francis 0
as 0
promulgating 0
this 0
document 0
“in 0
the 0
wake” 0
of 0
Pius 0
XII[1]. 0

In 0
fact, 0
Pope 0
Francis, 0
by 0
promulgating 0
the 0
Apostolic 0
Constitution 0
Vultum 0
Dei 0
quaerere, 0
on 0
June 0
29, 0
2016, 0
to 0
help 0
the 0
contemplatives 0
reach 0
the 0
aim 0
of 0
their 0
specific 0
vocation, 0
invited 0
reflection 0
and 0
discernment 0
on 0
the 0
precise 0
content 0
tied 0
to 0
consecrated 0
life 0
in 0
general 0
and 0
to 0
the 0
monastic 0
tradition 0
in 0
particular, 0
but 0
he 0
did 0
not 0
intend 0
to 0
abrogate 0
Sponsa 0
Christi 0
Ecclesia 0
that 0
was 0
derogated 0
only 0
in 0
some 0
points. 0

As 0
a 0
consequence, 0
the 0
two 0
pontifical 0
documents 0
are 0
to 0
be 0
held 0
as 0
normative 0
in 0
force 0
for 0
monasteries 0
of 0
nuns 0
and 0
must 0
be 0
read 0
in 0
a 0
unitary 0
vision. 0

But 0
of 0
course, 0
the 0
entire 0
game 0
is 0
given 0
away 0
in 0
the 0
next 0
paragraph: 0

Pope 0
Francis, 0
in 0
the 0
wake 0
of 0
the 0
teaching 0
of 0
Pope 0
Pius 0
XII 0
and 0
reaffirmed 0
by 0
Ecumenical 0
Vatican 0
Council 0
II, 0
intended 0
to 0
present 0
in 0
Vultum 0
Dei 0
quaerere 0
the 0
intense 0
and 0
fruitful 1
path 0
taken 0
by 0
the 0
Church 0
in 0
the 0
last 0
decades, 0
in 0
the 0
light 0
of 0
the 0
teachings 0
of 0
the 0
same 0
Council 0
and 0
considering 0
the 0
changed 0
socio-cultural 0
conditions. 0

Yes, 0
that’s 0
what 0
it 0
said. 0

Here’s 0
my 1
translation: 1

“The 0
Church’s 0
‘path’ 0
of 0
the 0
last 0
50 0
years 0
has 0
been 0
‘fruitful’. 1

How 0
do 0
you 0
know? 0

Because 0
we’re 0
telling 0
you 0
it 0
has.” 0

In 0
other 0
words, 0
there 0
have 0
been 0
absolutely 1
no 1
problems 1
whatever 1
with 0
the 0
direction 0
taken 0
either 0
by 0
the 0
Church 0
or 0
by 0
the 0
religious 0
life 0
since 0
Vatican 0
II. 0

Everything 0
that 0
has 0
happened 0
has 0
been 0
in 0
complete 1
and 1
perfect 1
continuity 0
between 0
the 0
Before 0
Church 0
and 0
the 0
After 0
Church; 0
there 0
has 0
been 0
no 0
rupture 0
or 0
break 0
with 0
the 0
past. 0

All 0
changes 0
undertaken 0
by 0
religious 0
houses 0
were 0
perfectly 1
legitimate 0
and 0
good 0
- 0
“fruitful” 1
if, 0
perhaps, 0
a 0
bit 0
“intense” 0
– 0
and 0
have 0
been 0
made 0
in 0
“light 0
of 0
the 0
teachings” 0
of 0
Vatican 0
II 0
and 0
“changed 0
socio-cultural 0
conditions.” 0
There 0
is, 0
therefore, 0
no 0
legitimate 0
reason 0
whatever 0
for 0
any 0
religious 0
house 0
to 0
attempt 0
to 0
“turn 0
back 0
the 0
clock” 0
to 0
the 0
pre-Vatican 0
II 0
norms 0
or 0
styles 0
of 0
religious 0
life. 0

Anyone 1
attempting 1
to 1
do 1
this 1
are 1
Bad 1
Nuns 1
[insert 0
string 0
of 0
incomprehensible 0
papal 0
insults 0
here.] 0

This 0
is 0
what 0
might 0
be 0
considered 0
the 0
guiding 0
principle 0
of 0
the 0
document; 0
“Nothing 0
to 0
see 0
here. 0

And 0
if 0
you 0
say 0
there 0
is, 0
you’re 0
the 0
problem.” 0

Of 0
course, 0
this 0
kind 0
of 0
bold 0
proclamation 0
is 0
very 0
much 0
in 0
keeping 0
with 0
the 0
habit 0
of 0
this 0
pontificate 0
to 0
simply 0
claim 0
there 0
are 0
no 0
problems 0
and 0
become 0
gravely 1
offended 1
and 1
outraged 1
when 0
the 0
contrary 0
is 0
pointed 0
out. 0

It’s 0
your 0
fault 0
if 0
you 0
find 0
contradictions, 0
not 0
theirs; 0
they’ve 0
said 0
there 0
are 0
no 0
contradictions, 0
therefore 0
there 0
aren’t 0
any. 0

After 0
all, 0
this 0
is 0
the 0
papacy 0
where 0
2 0
+ 0
2 0
= 0
5 0
if 0
the 0
pope 0
says 0
it 0
does. 0

The 0
irony, 0
of 0
course, 0
is 0
built 0
in, 0
since 0
this 0
document 0
is 0
intended 0
as 0
a 0
legal 0
chopping 0
block 0
for 0
the 0
dissolution 0
of 0
any 0
house 0
of 0
contemplative 0
nuns 0
that 0
is 0
judged 0
to 0
be 0
hovering 0
on 0
the 0
edge 0
of 0
extinction 1
or 0
is 0
for 0
some 0
other 0
reason 0
in 0
need 0
of 0
the 0
chop. 0

Why 0
would 0
the 0
Vatican 0
need 0
a 0
document 0
giving 0
extensive 0
norms 0
for 0
the 0
closure 0
of 0
monasteries 0
that 0
have 0
too 0
few 0
nuns 0
or 0
do 0
not 0
follow 0
their 0
originally 0
intended 0
charisms 0
if 0
everything 0
about 0
the 0
religious 0
life 0
since 0
Vatican 0
II 0
has 0
been 0
hunky 0
dory? 0

Let’s 0
remember 0
that 0
this 0
comes 0
from 0
the 0
Congregation 0
for 0
Religious 0
of 0
Braz 0
de’Aviz 0
and 0
Jose 0
Rodriguez 0
Carballo. 0

This 0
is 0
the 0
Cardinal 0
Braz 0
de’Aviz[2] 0
who 0
wasted 0
no 0
time 0
in 0
orienting 0
himself 0
in 0
the 0
New 0
Paradigm 0
when, 0
close 0
on 0
the 0
heels 0
of 0
the 0
Conclave 0
he 0
slammed 0
the 0
attempt 0
by 0
his 0
predecessor 0
– 0
and 0
by 0
extension 0
Pope 0
Benedict 0
– 0
to 0
reign 0
in 0
the 0
notorious 0
Leadership 0
Conference 0
of 0
Women 0
Religious 0
in 0
the 0
US. 0

He 0
complained 0
that 0
he 0
had 0
been 0
shut 0
out 0
of 0
the 0
process 0
under 0
Cardinal 0
Rode, 0
and 0
later 0
made 0
a 0
large 0
and 0
public 0
point 0
of 0
appeasing 0
and 0
mollifying 0
the 1
most 1
outspokenly 1
heretical 1
and 1
politicised 1
organisation 1
of 1
female 1
religious 1
in 1
the 1
world. 1

Apparently 0
the 0
total 0
statistical 0
collapse 0
of 0
the 0
religious 0
life 0
following 0
Vatican 0
II[3] 0
had 0
nothing 0
to 0
do 0
with 0
the 0
massive 0
systemic 0
changes 0
to 0
the 0
forms 0
of 0
that 0
life 0
– 0
always 0
claimed 0
to 0
be 0
“mandated” 0
by 0
“the 0
Council”. 0

And 0
of 0
course 0
we 0
are 0
talking 0
about 0
the 0
priorities 0
of 0
a 0
pope 0
who 0
has 0
said 0
that 0
seeing 0
a 0
“restorationist” 0
community 0
enjoying 0
a 0
large 0
number 0
of 0
vocations 0
makes 0
him 0
“worry.” 0
Apparently 0
this 0
worry 0
was 0
serious 0
enough 0
to 0
move 0
him 0
to 0
torpedo 1
one 0
of 0
the 1
most 1
flourishing 1
communities 0
in 0
the 0
modern 0
Church; 0
the 0
gaunt 1
spectre 0
of 0
the 0
Franciscan 0
Friars 0
and 0
Sisters 0
of 0
the 0
Immaculate 0
haunts 0
this 0
document. 0

Autonomy 1
vs. 0

Independence 0

One 0
of 0
the 0
talking 0
points 0
the 0
media 0
have 0
latched 0
onto 0
is 0
the 0
whole 0
business 0
of 0
“autonomy” 1
of 0
monasteries. 0

Many 0
of 0
the 0
headlines 0
crowed: 0
“Vatican 0
confirms 0
nuns’ 0
autonomy,” 1
or 0
similar. 0

But 0
that 0
word 0
does 0
not 0
mean 0
what 0
they 0
think 0
it 0
means. 0

In 0
fact, 0
the 0
word 0
“autonomy” 1
is 0
the 0
key 0
to 0
understanding 0
this 0
whole 0
thing. 0

It 0
appears 0
in 0
the 0
document 0
16 0
times 0
and 0
“autonomous” 1
30 0
times. 0

In 0
fact, 0
“autonomy” 1
is 0
held 0
up 0
as 0
the 0
single 0
most 0
important 0
criterion 0
for 0
determining 0
a 0
monastery’s 0
viability. 0

This 0
emphasis 0
is 0
repeated 0
so 0
often 0
one 0
might 0
almost 0
think 0
there 0
is 0
a 0
concern 0
in 0
Rome 0
that 0
the 0
“fruitful” 1
post-conciliar 0
monastic 0
life 0
is 0
in 0
danger 0
of 0
fizzling 0
out… 0
for… 0
some 0
reason… 0

Monastery 0
sui 0
juris 0
refers 0
to 0
the 0
religious 0
house 0
of 0
a 0
female 0
monastic 0
community 0
that, 0
having 0
the 0

In 0
order 0
to 0
obtain 0
juridical 0
autonomy 1
for 0
a 0
monastery 0
of 0

it 0
must 0
presuppose 0
a 0

the 0

in 0
all 0
its 0

(vocational, 0

In 0
this 0

Autonomy 1
of 0
life, 0
a 0
constant 0
prerequisite 0
for 0
maintaining 0
juridical 0
autonomy, 1
must 0
be 0
constantly 0
verified 0
by 0
the 0
Federal 0
President 0
who, 0
when 0
in 0
her 0
judgment 0
a 0
monastery 0
lacks 0
autonomy 1
of 0

must 0
inform 0
the 0

If 0
the 0

of 0

is 0

the 0
solution, 0
as 0
painful 0
as 0
it 0
is 0
necessary, 0
is 0
the 0

of 0
the 0
monastery. 0

no 0
longer 0

of 0
the 0
Federation 0

to 0
report 0
the 0
matter 0
to 0
the 0
Holy 0

When 0
an 0
autonomous 0
monastery 0
, 0
it 0
is 0
the 0
responsibility 0
ofto 0
the 0
Holy 0
See. 0

At 0
the 0
same 0
time, 0
this 0
document 0
is 0
redefining 0
the 0
term 0
“autonomous” 1
to 0
exclude 0
independence. 0

What 0
got 0
no 0
mention 0
in 0
the 0
brief 0
press 0
interest 0
was 0
the 0
document’s 0
insistence 0
that 0
all 0
monasteries 0
of 0
nuns 0
must 0
belong 0
to 0
a 0
federation 0
and 0
while 0
monasteries 0
must 0
demonstrate 0
“autonomy” 1
they 0
will 0
be 0
granted 0
little 0
in 0
the 0
way 0
of 0
powers 0
of 0
self-governance. 0

As 0
we 0
will 0
see, 0
the 0
federations 0
are 0
now 0
a 0
multilayered 0
system 0
of 0
internal 0
surveillance 0
and 0
centralised 0
control 0
that 0
leaves 0
Orwell 0
in 0
the 0
dust: 0

overcome 0
isolation 0
and 0
promote 0
regular 0
observance 0
and 0
contemplative 0
life. 0

Federation 0
of 0
monasteries 0
means 0
a 0
structure 0
of 0
communion 0
among 0
some 0
autonomous 0
monasteries 0
of 0
the 0
same 0
Institute 0
[4] 0
, 0
erected 0
by 0
the 0
Holy 0
See 0
that 0
approves 0
the 0
Statutes, 0
so 0
that 0
in 0
sharing 0
the 0
same 0
charism, 0
the 0
federated 0
monasteriesand 0
promote 0
regular 0
observance 0
and 0
contemplative 0
life. 0

Note 0
the 0
change: 0
“independent” 0
is 0
replaced 0
with 0
“isolated[5].” 0
It 0
reminds 0
me 0
of 0
a 0
conversation 0
I 0
had 0
with 0
a 0
superior 0
of 0
a 0
Benedictine 0
house 0
in 0
the 0
UK. 0

She 0
said 0
she 0
thought 0
that 0
the 0
psychiatric 0
testing, 0
that 0
in 0
2008 0
was 0
still 0
all 0
the 0
rage 0
among 0
the 0
houses 0
of 0
her 0
monastery’s 0
federation, 0
was 0
excessive 0
and 0
not 0
helpful. 0

She 0
didn’t 0
trust 0
the 0
heavily 0
secularised 0
field 0
of 0
psychology 0
to 0
help 0
in 0
determining 0
a 0
candidate’s 0
suitability 0
for 0
religious 0
life, 0
so 0
she 0
didn’t 0
require 0
these 0
tests 0
of 0
her 0
monastery’s 0
postulants. 0

She 0
also 0
said 0
that 0
she 0
was 0
under 0
constant 0
pressure, 0
both 0
the 0
subtle 0
pressure 0
of 0
general 0
peer 0
disapproval 0
and 0
overt 0
requests 0
to 0
conform 0
by 0
the 0
federation’s 0
leadership. 0

Was 0
that 0
monastery 0
“isolated”? 0

Or 0
just 0
exercising 0
lawful 0
self-governance? 0

And 0
given 0
that 0
autonomy 1
is 0
being 0
held 0
up 0
as 0
the 0
sole 0
criterion 0
for 0
viability 0
of 0
a 0
monastery, 0
it 0
seems 0
the 0
Holy 0
See 0
is 0
not 0
interested 0
in 0
asking 0
whether 0
it 0
is 0
actually 0
faithful 0
to 0
the 0
charism, 0
or 0
even 0
to 0
the 0
Catholic 0
Faith, 0
a 0
question 0
that 0
has 0
burned 0
brightly 0
for 0
serious 0
Catholics 0
for 0
some 0
time. 0

The 0
word 0
“fidelity” 0
appears 0
in 0
the 0
document 0
four 0
times, 0
which 0
may 0
give 0
an 0
idea 0
of 0
how 0
much 0
interest 0
the 0
Vatican 0
has 0
in 0
this 0
issue. 0

Funny 0
you 0
should 0
mention 0
autonomy: 1
Bioethics 0
and 0
the 0
dissolution 0
of 0
“unviable” 0
monasteries 0

It’s 0
funny 0
that 0
the 0
buzzword 0
of 0
the 0
day 0
in 0
Rome 0
should 0
be 0
“autonomy”. 1

As 0
we 0
shall 0
see, 0
the 0
document 0
is 0
what 0
I’ve 0
called 0
above 0
a 0
“chopping 0
block”. 0

Vultum 0
dei 0
quaerere 0
made 0
it 0
clear 0
that 0
this 0
juridical 0
document 0
would 0
provide 0
a 0
set 0
of 0
legal 0
criteria 0
by 0
which 0
a 0
monastery 0
can 0
be 0
considered 0
viable, 0
religious 0
life 0
worthy 0
of 0
life, 0
so 0
to 0
speak, 0
and 0
that 0
those 0
considered 0
to 0
have 0
failed 0
the 0
test 0
would 0
be 0
closed. 0

Note 0
the 0
language 0
used 0
here: 0

If 0
the 0
situation 0
of 0
incapacity 0
is 0
irreversible, 0
the 0
solution, 0
as 0
painful 0
as 0
it 0
is 0
necessary, 0
is 0
the 0
suppression 0
of 0
the 0
monastery. 0

It 0
jogged 0
a 0
memory 0
for 0
me. 0

“Incapacity”… 0
Where 0
had 0
I 0
heard 0
that 0
language 0
used 0
before? 0

Most 0
pro-life 0
observers 0
in 0
Britain 0
will 0
tell 0
you 0
that 0
it 0
was 0
the 0
“Mental 0
Capacity 0
Act” 0
of 0
2005 0
that 0
established 0
in 0
British 0
law 0
the 0
concept 0
that 0
a 0
person 0
with 0
permanently 0
“reduced 0
capacity” 0
could 0
be 0
legally 0
starved 0
and/or 0
dehydrated 0
to 0
death 0
by 0
doctors. 0

This 0
is 0
the 0
world, 0
the 0
language, 0
of 0
Bioethics, 0
applied 0
utilitarianism, 0
also 0
called 0
“Principlism” 0
after 0
its 0
three 0
bioethical 0
criteria 0
of 0
“justice, 0
beneficence[6] 0
and 0
autonomy” 1
– 0
it 0
is 0
a 0
patient’s 0
ability 0
to 0
demonstrate 0
his 0
“autonomy” 1
or 0
“quality 0
of 0
life,[7]” 0
either 0
currently 0
or 0
potentially, 0
that 0
decides 0
his 0
fate. 0

This 0
set 0
of 0
criteria 0
is 0
being 0
applied 0
in 0
medical 0
institutions 0
across 0
the 0
western 0
world 0
now, 0
a 0
“new 0
paradigm” 0
of 0
ethics 0
replacing 0
traditional 0
“Hippocratic” 0
or 0
“Natural 0
Law” 0
medical 0
ethics. 0

Under 0
this 0
system 0
the 0
onus, 0
effectively, 0
is 0
on 0
the 0
patient 0
to 0
prove 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
new 0
criteria 0
that 0
he 0
is 0
worthy 0
of 0
receiving 0
medical 0
treatment 0
– 0
of 0
continuing 0
to 0
live. 0

Medical 0
treatment 0
(which 0
legally 0
includes 0
food 0
and 0
water) 0
can 0
be 0
withdrawn 0
from 0
patients 0
who 0
fail 0
to 0
demonstrate 0
that 0
they 0
will 0
recover 0
sufficiently 0
to 0
return 0
to 0
an 0
autonomous 1
lifestyle. 0

Health 0
care 0
systems 0
like 0
that 0
of 0
the 0
UK 0
have 0
government 0
regulatory 0
boards 0
giving 0
out 0
“guidelines” 0
to 0
determine 0
in 0
a 0
uniform 0
way 0
how 0
health 0
care 0
resources 0
are 0
allocated. 0

These 0
guidelines 0
are 0
collated 0
by 0
professional 0
Bioethicists 0
applying 0
their 0
utilitarian 0
criteria. 0

If 0
the 0
equation 0
doesn’t 0
come 0
out 0
in 0
the 0
patient’s 0
favour, 0
the 0
“treatment” 0
recommended 0
for 0
the 0
patient’s 0
“best 0
interests” 0
will 0
include 0
his 0
demise, 0
often 0
procured 0
by 0
withdrawing 0
nutrition 0
and 0
hydration 0
and/or 0
administering 0
slowly 0
lethal 0
doses 0
of 0
sedatives. 0

The 0
NHS 0
in 0
the 0
UK 0
has 0
actually 0
gone 0
to 0
court, 0
and 0
won, 0
declaring 0
that 0
they 0
must 0
retain 0
the 0
right 0
to 0
kill 0
patients 0
who 0
fail 0
the 0
Bioethics 0
test. 0

The 0
result 0
has 0
been 0
a 0
quiet 0
reign 1
of 1
terror 1
in 0
which 0
elderly 0
and 0
disabled 0
people 0
have 0
started 0
carrying 0
cards 0
stating 0
in 0
legalese 0
that 0
they 0
do 0
not 0
want 0
to 0
be 0
killed 0
by 0
their 0
doctors. 0

In 0
one 0
case 0
a 0
man 0
with 0
ALS 0
took 0
the 0
NHS 0
to 0
court 0
in 0
an 0
ultimately 0
unsuccessful 0
attempt 0
to 0
preemptively 0
preclude 0
his 0
medical 0
murder 0
when 0
his 0
illness 0
left 0
him 0
incapacitated. 0

The 0
system, 0
in 0
other 0
words, 0
is 0
stacked 0
against 0
the 0
patient, 0
in 0
favour 0
of 0
the 0
government 0
that 0
holds 0
all 0
the 0
cards. 0

Keep 0
these 0
facts 0
in 0
mind 0
as 0
we 0
read 0
through 0
the 0
rest 0
of 0
the 0
document. 0

I 0
think 0
we 0
can 0
find 0
an 0
almost 0
perfect 0
analogy 0
by 0
replacing 0
the 0
term 0
“patient” 0
with 0
“monastery.” 0
Think 0
about 0
how 0
one 0
would 0
apply 0
concepts 0
like 0
“autonomy,” 1
“viability,” 0
“incapacity,” 0
“quality 0
of 0
life” 0
and 0
“equitable 0
distribution 0
of 0
scarce 0
resources” 0
to 0
this 0
context. 0

When 0
the 0
language 0
of 0
utilitarianism 0
appears 0
in 0
Vatican 0
documents 0
as 0
guiding 0
criteria 0
for 0
the 0
contemplative 0
religious 0
life, 0
one 0
has 0
to 0
wonder 0
at 0
what 0
point 0
has 0
the 0
entire 0
project 0
gone 0
so 0
disastrously 1
off 0
the 0
rails. 0

Federations 0
as 0
Vatican 0
watchdogs 0

Under 0
this 0
law, 0
all 0
monasteries 0
of 0
contemplative 0
nuns 0
must 0
belong 0
to 0
a 0
federation. 0

Previously 0
only 0
voluntary 0
and 0
consultative, 0
federations 0
will 0
now 0
have 0
the 0
power 0
to 0
supervise 0
and 0
guide 0
the 0
formation 0
of 0
candidates, 0
nuns 0
and 0
of 0
their 0
formators, 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
possess 0
broad 0
powers 0
over 0
temporal 0
goods 0
of 0
individual 0
monasteries 0
and 0
powers 0
of 0
suppression. 0

The 0
document 0
makes 0
it 0
inarguable 0
that 0
the 0
federation’s 0
main 0
role 0
will 0
be 0
to 0
establish 0
and 0
monitor 0
for 0
conformity 0
to 0
a 0
particular 0
programme 0
– 0
the 0
“intense 0
and 0
fruitful 1
path” 0
of 0
the 0
Church 0
since 0
1965 0
– 0
both 0
within 0
the 0
various 0
orders 0
and 0
between 0
them: 0

The 0
Federal 0
Assembly: 0

deals 0
with 0
issues 0
of 0
major 0
importance; 0
makes 0
decisions 0
and 0
issues 0
norms 0
that 0
all 0
nuns 0
are 0
required 0
to 0
observe, 0
after 0
the 0
definitive 0
approval 0
of 0
the 0
Holy 0
See; 0

More 0
than 0
just 0
federations; 0
a 0
multi-tier 0
system 0
of 0
control 0

Conference 0
of 0
monasteries 0
means 0
a 0
structure 0
of 0
communion 0
among 0
autonomous 1
monasteries, 0
belonging 0
to 0
diverse 0
Institutes 0
and 0
present 0
in 0
the 0
same 0
region... 0
in 0
particular 0
geographical 0
or 0
linguistic 0
contexts. 0

In 0
other 0
words, 0
Benedictine 0
federations 0
of 0
a 0
given 0
area 0
will 0
form 0
a 0
“Conference” 0
with 0
Carmelite 0
federations 0
and 0
Dominican 0
federations 0
and 0
Poor 0
Clare 0
federations, 0
etc. 0

This 0
will 0
be 0
of 0
interest 0
to 0
Carmelite 0
houses 0
especially, 0
since 0
they 0
tend 0
to 0
be 0
generally 0
more 0
on 0
the 0
“conservative” 0
end 0
of 0
things. 0

Imagine 0
a 0
house 0
of 0
traditional 0
Carmelites 0
attending 0
regional 0
Conference 0
meetings 0
– 0
and 0
attempting 0
to 0
keep 0
up 0
their 0
Office 0
schedule 0
– 0
with 0
the 0
balloons-and-guitars, 0
break 0
dancing 0
Franciscans…What 0
fun! 0

And 0
finally, 0
just 0
in 0
case 0
one 0
entire 0
federation 0
decides 0
to 0
turn 0
back 0
the 0
clock, 0
there 0
will 0
be 0
an 0
umbrella 0
for 0
the 0
umbrellas; 0
there 0
will 0
be 0
watchers 0

Federations 0
will 0
now 0
have 0
extremely 0
broad 0
powers 0
both 0
over 0
money 0
and 0
property 0
and, 0
crucially, 0
over 0
formation 0
of 0

It 0
is 0
the 0
Federation 0
that 0
now 0
has 0
the 0
power 0
to 0
monitor 0
for 0
compliance 0
with 0
the 0
rules, 0
to 0
report 0
non-compliance 0
to 0
the 0
Holy 0
See, 0
to 0
make 0
new 0
foundations 0
and, 0
apparently, 0
to 0
“encourage” 0
individual 0
monasteries 0
to 0
“communicate” 0
their 0
goods. 0

The 0
legitimately 0
established 0
Federation 0
is 0
a 0
public 0
juridic 0
person 0
in 0
the 0

and 0
is 0
therefore 0
able 0
to 0
acquire, 0
possess, 0
administer, 0
and 0
alienate 0
temporal, 0
movable 0

goods, 0
which 0
are 0

in 0

needs 0
of 0
the 0
Federation. 0

The 0
Federation 0
considers 0
the 0
assets 0
in 0
its 0
possession 0
as 0
necessary 0
and 0
useful 0
means 0
to 0
achieve 0
its 0
goals. 0

Financial 0
incentives 0

Given 0
that 0
we 0
shall 0
see 0
below 0
that 0
the 0
provisions 0
for 0
suppression 0
of 0
monasteries 0
include 0
vague 0
and 0
indefinable 0
qualities 0
like 0
“vitality 0
in 0
living 0
and 0
transmitting 0
the 0
charism” 0
and 0
“dynamic 0
fidelity” 0
to 0
the 0
order’s 0
charism, 0
and 0
that 0
the 0
goods 0
of 0
extinct 0
monasteries 0
will 0
be 0
assumed 0
by 0
the 0
federation, 0
one 0
might 0
be 0
forgiven 0
for 0
asking 0
if 0
this 0
creates 0
an 0
incentive 0
to 0
see 0
to 0
it 0
that 0
certain 0
houses 0
go 0
extinct[8]. 0

Since 0
the 0
document 0
provides 0
several 0
mechanisms 0
by 0
which 0
a 0
federation 0
can 0
move 0
nuns 0
out 0
of 0
a 0
monastery, 0
this 0
could 0
be 0
one 0
of 0
those 0
indelicate 0
questions 0
some 0
superiors 0
might 0
want 0
to 0
keep 0
in 0
mind. 0

Article 0
94 0
requires 0
that 0
once 0
it 0
is 0
canonically 0
erected 0
the 0
federation 0
is 0
to 0
seek 0
“legal 0
recognition 0
also 0
in 0
the 0
civil 0
sphere.” 0
This, 0
presumably, 0
will 0
bear 0
upon 0
legal 0
disputes 0
in 0
civil 0
courts 0
over 0
the 0
property 0
of 0

extinct: 0

In 0
the 0
event 0
of 0
the 0
suppression 0
of 0
a 0
totally 0
extinct 0
monastery, 0
when 0
there 0
are 0

assets, 0
in 0
compliance 0
with 0

go 0
to 0
the 0
respective 0

juridical 0
person, 0
that 0
is, 0
to 0
the 0
Federation 0
of 0

or 0
to 0
another 0
structure 0
of 0

by 0

by 0
the 0
donations 0
of 0

and 0
by 0

deriving 0
from 0
the 0
alienation 0

Federations 0
in 0

The 0
Federation 0
President, 0
in 0
particular, 0
watches 0
over 0
initial 0
and 0
ongoing 0
formation 0
in 0
the 0
monasteries 0
to 0
see 0
if 0
it 0
is 0
in 0
conformity 0
with 0
the 0
charism 0
proper 0
to 0
the 0
Institute, 0
so 0
that 0
every 0
community 0
may 0
be 0
a 0
beacon 0
that 0
illumines 0
the 0
journey 0
of 0
the 0
men 0
and 0
women 0
of 0
our 0
time. 0

At 0
the 0
end 0
of 0
the 0
visit, 0
she 0
will 0
inform 0
the 0
Holy 0
See 0
about 0
the 0
real 0
possibilities 0
that 0
the 0
monastery 0
has 0
or 0
does 0
not 0
have 0
of 0
guaranteeing 0
initial 0
formation. 0

The 0
formation 0
of 0
the 0
formators 0
and 0
their 0
collaborators 0
is 0
entrusted 0
in 0
part 0
to 0
the 0
monasteries 0
and 0
in 0
part 0
to 0
the 0
Federation, 0
therefore, 0
the 0
President 0
of 0
the 0
Federation 0
is 0
called 0
to 0
strengthen 0
formation 0
at 0
the 0
federal 0
level 0
and 0
to 0
require 0
the 0
participation 0
of 0
those 0
who 0
exercise 0
the 0
service 0
of 0
formation; 0
if 0
this 0
does 0
not 0
happen, 0
she 0
will 0
refer 0
the 0
matter 0
to 0
the 0
Holy 0
See. 0

The 0
President 0
of 0
the 0
Federation, 0
having 0
heard 0
the 0
opinion 0
of 0
the 0
Federal 0
Council, 0
chooses 0
the 0
most 0
appropriate 0
places 0
to 0
hold 0
the 0
specific 0
formative 0
courses 0
for 0
the 0
formators 0
and 0
their 0
collaborators, 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
those 0
who 0
are 0
called 0
to 0
exercise 0
the 0
service 0
of 0
authority, 0
establishing 0
the 0
duration 0
of 0
these 0
courses 0
in 0
such 0
a 0
way 0
that 0
they 0
are 0
not 0
detrimental 0
to 0
the 0
needs 0
of 0
the 0
contemplative 0
life 0
and 0
of 0
the 0
community. 0

Who 0
makes 0
new 0
foundations 0
and 0
why? 0

Throughout 0
the 0
history 0
of 0
the 0
Church, 0
it 0
has 0
been 0
the 0
prerogative 0
of 0
bishops 0
to 0
establish 0
houses 0
of 0
contemplatives 0
in 0
their 0
own 0
dioceses. 0

Now, 0
with 0
the 0
pope 0
having 0
forbidden 0
bishops 0
to 0
exercise 0
this 0
ancient 0
right, 0
according 0
to 0
this 0
document, 0
the 0
federations 0
themselves 0
can 0
make 0
foundations. 0

through 0
the 0
action 0
of 0
the 0
Federation, 0
as 0

The 0
foundation 0
of 0
a 0
monastery 0
of 0
nuns, 0
keeping 0
in 0
mind 0
what 0
is 0
established 0
in 0
no. 0

39 0
of 0
the 0
present 0
Instruction, 0
can 0
take 0
place 0
either 0
by 0
a 0
single 0
monastery 0
or, 0
as 0
established 0
by 0
the 0
Federal 0
Assembly 0
[9] 0

A 0
single 0
monastic 0
community 0
that 0
decides 0
to 0
make 0
a 0
foundation, 0
moreover, 0
must 0
be 0
“helped” 0
and 0
guided 0
by 0
the 0
federation: 0

In 0
discerning 0
the 0
foundation 0
of 0
a 0
new 0
monastery 0
on 0
the 0

and 0
the 0
religious 0
Assistant 0

the 0
Superior 0
of 0

The 0
discernment 0
on 0
the 0
foundation 0
of 0
a 0
new 0
monastery 0
by 0
the 0
Federation 0
is 0
made 0
within 0
the 0
framework 0
of 0
the 0
Federal 0
Assembly. 0

Article 0
39 0
tells 0
us 0
some 0
criteria 0
for 0
making 0
foundations 0
that 0
“must 0
be 0
considered 0
in 0
their 0
entirety 0
and 0
from 0
an 0
overall 0
perspective.” 0

the 0
necessary 0
vitality 0
in 0
living 0
and 0
transmitting 0
the 0
charism,” 0
composed 0
of 0
at 0
least 0
eight 0
nuns 0
of 0
solemn 0
vows, 0
“as 0
long 0
as 0
most 0
are 0
not 0
of 0
advanced 0
age”. 0

a) 0
A 0
community 0
that 0
has 0
given 0
good 0
testimony 0
of 0
fraternal 0
life 0
in 0
common 0
with 0
“” 0
composed 0
of 0
at 0
least 0
eight 0
nuns 0
of 0
solemn 0
vows, 0
“as 0
long 0
as 0
most 0
are 0
not 0
of 0
advanced 0
age”. 0

b) 0
Besides 0
the 0
number, 0
special 0
skills 0
are 0
required 0
of 0
some 0
nuns 0
of 0
the 0
community 0
who 0
must 0
be 0
able 0
to 0
assume: 0
as 0
Superior, 0
the 0
service 0
of 0
authority; 0
as 0
formator, 0
the 0
initial 0
formation 0
of 0
candidates; 0
as 0
financial 0
administrator, 0
the 0
administration 0
of 0
the 0
goods 0
of 0
the 0
monastery. 0

c) 0
Rooms 0
adapted 0
to 0
the 0
lifestyle 0
of 0
the 0
community, 0
to 0
ensure 0
that 0
the 0
nuns 0
can 0
regularly 0
lead 0
the 0
contemplative 0
life 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
nature 0
and 0
spirit 0
of 0
their 0
Institute. 0

d) 0
Economic 0
conditions 0
that 0
guarantee 0
the 0
community 0
itself 0
can 0
provide 0
for 0
the 0
needs 0
of 0
daily 0
life. 0

One 0
of 0
these 0
things 0
is 0
not 0
like 0
the 0
others. 0

Did 0
you 0
notice? 0

One 0
criterion 0
stands 0
out 0
as 0
indeterminate, 0
vague, 0
compared 0
with 0
the 0
other 0
concrete 0
and 0
measurable 0
standards. 0

One 0
aspect 0
of 0
legislative 0
analysis 0
that 0
I 0
learned 0
early 0
was 0
that 0
the 0
terms 0
used 0
are 0
of 0
utmost 0
importance. 0

If 0
a 0
term 0
is 0
vague 0
or 0
is 0
defined 0
incorrectly 0
that 0
is 0
a 0
“loophole”. 0

Or 0
it 0
could 0
perhaps 0
be 0
described 0
as 0
a 0
handle; 0
a 0
place 0
where 0
a 0
person 0
who 0
wants 0
to 0
effect 0
a 0
particular 0
outcome 0
can 0
grasp 0
a 0
piece 0
of 0
legislation 0
to 0
use 0
it 0
like 0
an 0
axe. 0

So, 0
how, 0
exactly, 0
is 0
it 0
to 0
be 0
determined 0
– 0
and 0
by 0
whom 0
– 0
that 0
a 0
group 0
of 0
nuns 0
possess 0
“the 0
necessary 0
vitality 0
in 0
living 0
and 0
transmitting 0
the 0
charism”? 0

What, 0
precisely, 0
does 0
the 0
term 0
“vitality” 0
mean 0
and 0
exactly 0
how 0
is 0
one 0
to 0
measure 0
out 0
how 0
much 0
is 0
required? 0

Is 0
this 0
one 0
of 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
little 0
personal, 0
secret 0
expressions 0
of 0
which 0
only 0
he 0
knows 0
the 0
meaning? 0

Like 0
the 0
secret 0
to 0
how 0
nuns 0
are 0
to 0
smile 0
properly? 0

Does 0
the 0
inclusion 0
of 0
completely 0
subjective 0
criteria 0
belong 0
in 0
a 0
juridical 0
document? 0

Or 0
is 0
it 0
in 0
there 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
provide 0
cover 0
for 0
prelates? 0

The 0
next 0
article 0
tells 0
us, 0
“It 0
is 0
the 0
responsibility 0
of 0
the 0
Holy 0
See 0
to 0
evaluate 0
the 0
presence 0
of 0
these 0
requisites.” 0
Do 0
they 0
have 0
an 0
electronic 0
meter 0
in 0
a 0
cupboard 0
in 0
the 0
Congregation 0
for 0
Religious 0
that 0
measures 0
“charism 0
vitality”? 0

It 0
seems 0
important 0
to 0
ask 0
because 0
article 0
70, 0
on 0
how 0
to 0
suppress 0
a 0
monastery, 0
includes 0
it: 0

Among 0
the 0
criteria 0
that 0
can 0
contribute 0
to 0
determine 0
a 0
judgment 0
concerning 0
the 0
suppression 0
of 0
a 0
monastery, 0
after 0
having 0
examined 0
all 0
the 0
circumstances, 0
the 0
following 0
points 0
should 0
be 0
considered 0
as 0
a 0
whole: 0
the 0
number 0
of 0
nuns, 0
the 0
advanced 0
age 0
of 0
the 0
majority 0
of 0
the 0
members, 0
the 0
real 0
capacity 0
for 0
government 0
and 0
formation, 0
lack 0
of 0
candidates 0
for 0
a 0
number 0
of 0
years, 0
lack 0
of 0
the 0
necessary 0
vitality 0
in 0
living 0
and 0
transmitting 0
the 0
charism 0
in 0
dynamic 0
fidelity[10]. 0

You 0
will 0
be 0
affiliated; 0
resistance 0
is 0
futile… 0

It 0
seems 0
there 0
are 0
two 0
themes 0
running 0
through 0
the 0
document: 0
to 0
establish 0
a 0
certain 0
value 0
of 0
“autonomy” 1
as 0
the 0
indispensable 0
criterion 0
for 0
viability, 0
while 0
at 0
the 0
same 0
time 0
asserting 0
top-down 0
oversight 0
and 0
control 0
over 0
who 0
gets 0
to 0
make 0
this 0
determination. 0

In 0
short, 0
a 0
monastery 0
must 0
be 0
autonomous, 1
but 0
heaven 0
help 0
the 0
community 0
that 0
asserts 0
its 0
independence. 0

Articles 0
54-64 0
offer 0
an 0
interim 0
measure 0
in 0
the 0
case 0
of 0
“incapacity” 0
that 0
is 0
really 0
just 0
more 0
of 0
the 0
second 0
thing. 0

Once 0
a 0
lack 0
of 0
autonomy 1
has 0
been 0
established… 0

54 0
Affiliation 0
is 0
a 0
particular 0
form 0
of 0
help 0
that 0
the 0
Holy 0
See 0
establishes 0
in 0
particular 0
situations 0
in 0
favor 0
of 0
the 0
community 0
of 0
a 0
monastery 0
sui 0
juris 0
which 0
has 0
only 0
an 0
asserted 0
autonomy, 0
but 0
in 0
reality, 0
very 0
precarious 0
or, 0
in 0
fact, 0
non-existent. 0

55 0
Affiliation 0
is 0
configured 0
as 0
a 0
juridical 0
support 0
that 0
must 0
assess 0
whether 0
the 0
inability 0
to 0
manage 0
the 0
life 0
of 0
the 0
autonomous 1
monastery 0
in 0
all 0
its 0
dimensions 0
is 0
only 0
temporary 0
or 0
is 0
irreversible, 0
helping 0
the 0
community 0
of 0
the 0
affiliated 0
monastery 0
to 0
overcome 0
difficulties 0
or 0
to 0
put 0
in 0
place 0
what 0
is 0
necessary 0
to 0
bring 0
about 0
the 0
suppression 0
of 0
this 0
monastery. 0

How 0
does 0
affiliation 0
work? 0

Well, 0
the 0
federation 0
and 0
the 0
Holy 0
See 0
between 0
them 0
work 0
it 0
out: 0

In 0
these 0
cases, 0
it 0
is 0
up 0
to 0
the 0
Holy 0
See 0
to 0
evaluate 0
the 0
opportunity 0
of 0
setting 0
up 0
an 0
ad 0
hoc 0
commission 0
formed 0
by 0
the 0
Ordinary, 0
the 0
Federation 0
President, 0
the 0
Federal 0
Assistant, 0
and 0
the 0
Major 0
Superior 0
of 0
the 0
monastery 0

It’s 0
starting 0
to 0
be 0
clear 0
that 0
the 0
federation 0
is 0
going 0
to 0
be 0
little 0
more 0
than 0
the 0
Big 1
Brother 1
hit-squad 0
of 0
the 0
Congregation 0
for 0
Religious. 0

It’s 0
worth 0
remembering 0
what 0
happened 0
in 0
the 0
case 0
of 0
a 0
German 0
men’s 0
monastery 0
in 0
which 0
the 0
superior 0
tried 0
to 0
return 0
the 0
community 0
to 0
pre-Vatican 0
II 0
practices. 0

Mariawald 0
Trappist 0
monastery 0
– 0
900 0
years 0
old 0
– 0
was 0
finally 0
dissolved, 0
affiliated 0
to 0
death. 0

Its 0
superior 0
had 0
made 0
the 0
fatal 1
error 0
of 0
openly 0
declaring 0
– 0
in 0
2008, 0
after 0
the 0
publication 0
of 0
Summorum 0
Pontificum 0
– 0
that 0
the 0
monastery’s 0
problems 0
all 0
began 0
when 0
it 0
adopted 0
the 0
new 0
liturgical 0
rites 0
and 0
implemented 0
the 0
trends 0
of 0
all 0
religious 0
after 0
Vatican 0
II, 0
and 0
that 0
clearly 0
the 0
solution 0
was 0
to 0
go 0
back 0
to 0
pre-conciliar 0
ways. 0

Mariawald 0
was 0
consequently 0
affiliated, 0
in 0
the 0
manner 0
this 0
document 0
describes, 0
with 0
a 0
liberal 0
house 0
in 0
the 0
Netherlands 0
whose 0
superior, 0
unsurprisingly, 0
discovered 0
that 0
the 0
house 0
was 0
hopelessly 0
divided 0
and 0
could 0
not 0
be 0
saved. 0

What 0
would 0
make 0
forced 0
affiliation 0
a 0
truly 1
devastating 1
weapon 0
against 0
conservative 0
or 0
traditional 0
communities 0
is 0
the 0
proviso 0
that 0
an 0
affiliated 0
monastery 0
may 0
not 0
form 0
its 0
own 0
novices: 0

60 0
The 0
affiliated 0
monastery 0
can 0
accept 0
candidates, 0
but 0
the 0
novitiate 0
and 0

performed 0
in 0
the 0

in 0

Of 0
course, 0
this 0
means 0
it 0
is 0
the 0
affiliating 0
monastery’s 0
formation 0
team 0
that 0
would 0
make 0
the 0
determination 0
to 0
dismiss 0
recalcitrant, 0

This 0

_______________ 0

[1] 0
It 0
would 0
seem, 0
therefore, 0
that 0
a 0
useful 0
task 0
for 0
someone 0
writing 0
about 0
what 0
this 0
pope 0
intends 0
for 0
nuns 0
would 0
be 0
to 0
read 0
Sponsa 0
Christi 0
Ecclesia 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
Francis’ 0
Apostolic 0
Constitution 0
and 0
make 0
a 0
careful 0
comparison. 0

I’m 0
not 0
going 0
to 0
do 0
that 0
here, 0
but 0
it 0
might 0
be 0
helpful 0
to 0
examine 0
the 0
two 0
documents 0
with 0
the 0
help 0
of 0
a 0
expert 0
at 0
some 0
point. 0

[2] 0
Worth 0
remembering, 0
however, 0
is 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
it 0
was 0
Benedict 0
the 0
“conservative,” 0
not 0
Francis, 0
who 0
appointed 0
Braz 0
de’ 0
Aviz 0
in 0
the 0
office 0
to 0
replace 0
Cardinal 0
Rode 0
– 0
presumably 0
under 0
that 0
good 0
old 0
“conservative” 0
rubric 0
of 0
the 0
“big 0
umbrella” 0
– 0
under 0
whom 0
these 0
culpably 0
belated 0
attempts 0
to 0
save 0
US 0
religious 0
life 0
were 0
started. 0

[3] 0
Just 0
considering 0
the 0
numbers 0
of 0
course. 0

Leaving 0
alone 0
the 0
doctrinal 0
issues. 0

[4] 0
“The 0
same 0
Institute” 0
means 0
the 0
order 0
in 0
question, 0
whether 0
Benedictine, 0
Dominican, 0
Carmelite 0
etc. 0

[5] 0
I’d 0
love 0
to 0
hear 0
from 0
some 0
monastic 0
superior 0
who 0
had 0
the 0
nerve 0
to 0
tell 0
Rome, 0
“Actually, 0
given 0
that 0
all 0
our 0
neighbours 0
in 0
religion 0
are 0
raging 0
neo-modernist 0
heretics, 0
if 0
not 0
schismatics, 0
we 0
think 0
‘isolation’ 0
is 0
a 0
desirable 0
thing 0
– 0
like 0
quarantine 0
during 0
an 0
outbreak 0
of 0
Bubonic 0
Plague 0
– 0
and 0
would 0
therefore 0
like 0
to 0
be 0
dispensed 0
from 0
the 0
federation 0
requirement.” 0
I’d 0
pay 0
good 0
money 0
to 0
see 0
the 0
shade 0
of 0
purple 0
the 0
well-fed 1
Braz 0
de’Aviz 0
turned. 0

[6] 0
“justice 0
and 0
beneficence” 0
are 0
considered 0
on 0
behalf 0
of 0
the 0
community, 0
not 0
the 0
patient 0

[7] 0
Bioethicists 0
take 0
it 0
as 0
read 0
that 0
in 0
order 0
for 0
a 0
life 0
to 0
have 0
sufficient 0
“quality” 0
it 0
must 0
demonstrate 0
sufficient 0
autonomy. 0

Dependence 0
upon 0
the 0
care 0
of 0
others 0
is, 0
quite 1
literally, 1
a 0
capital 0
offence. 0

[8] 0
Readers 0
may 0
think 0
I’m 0
exaggerating 0
the 0
danger 0
of 0
material 0
motivations 0
for 0
suppressing 0
monasteries, 0
but 0
as 0
we 0
will 0
see, 0
the 0
distinction 0
between 0
the 0
federations 0
and 0
the 0
Holy 0
See 0
is 0
also 0
a 0
matter 0
of 0
paperwork 0
and 0
it 0
is 0
well 0
to 0
recall 0
that 0
the 0
secretary 0
for 0
the 0
Congregation 0
for 0
Religious, 0
Jose 0
Rodrigues 0
Carballo, 0
was 0
a 0
person 0
of 0
interest 0
to 0
international 0
police 0
agencies 0
for 0
the 0
loss 0
of 0
“tens 0
of 0
millions” 0
of 0
Euros 0
from 0
the 0
coffers 0
of 0
the 0
Franciscan 0
Friars 0
Minor, 0
the 0
original 0
Franciscan 0
order 0
of 0
which 0
he 0
had 0
been 0
the 0
head. 0

Shortly 0
after 0
Carballo’s 0
appointment, 0
it 0
was 0
revealed 0
that 0
the 0
Swiss 0
prosecutor’s 0
office 0
was 0
investigating 0
the 0
money 0
missing 0
from 0
the 0
Friars 0
Minor 0
in 0
connection 0
with 0
drugs, 0
money 0
laundering 0
operations 0
and 0
gun 0
running. 0

Carballo 0
was 0
Francis’ 0
very 0
first 0
appointment, 0
April 0
6, 0
2013, 0
three 0
weeks 0
after 0
the 0
Conclave 0
and 0
it 0
was 0
to 0
him 0
that 0
the 0
pope 0
gave 0
the 0
task 0
of 0
the 0
destruction 0
of 0
the 0
FFIs, 0
and 0
a 0
major 0
part 0
of 0
that 0
operation 0
was 0
to 0
separate 0
the 0
FFIs 0
from 0
real 0
assets 0
valued 0
at 0
about 0
30 0
million 0
Euros. 0

[9] 0
So 0
much 0
for 0
the 0
principle 0
of 0
subsidiarity. 0

I 0
can 0
imagine 0
what 0
a 0
monastery 0
founded 0
by 0
a 0
committee 0
would 0
be 0
like 0
to 0
live 0
in. 0

[10] 0
We’ll 0
pass 0
over 0
“dynamic 1
fidelity” 1
in 0
silence 0
for 0
now… 0
