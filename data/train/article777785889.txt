Thursday 0 62 4
afternoon 0 62 4

out 0 62 4
an 0 62 4
affidavit 0 62 4
for 0 62 4
a 0 62 4

reasonably 0 62 4
believed 0 62 4
was 0 62 4
occupied 0 62 4

the 0 62 4
child 0 62 4
that 0 62 4
was 0 62 4
abducted. 0 62 4

This 0 62 5
warrant 0 62 5
came 0 62 5
after 0 62 5
a 0 62 5
two-month 0 62 5
investigation 0 62 5
in 0 62 5
conjunction 0 62 5
with 0 62 5
Clayton 0 62 5

According 0 62 6
to 0 62 6
Sheriff 0 62 6
Hogrefe 0 62 6
the 0 62 6
FBI 0 62 6
had 0 62 6
recently 0 62 6
provided 0 62 6
information 0 62 6
and 0 62 6
surveillance 0 62 6
on 0 62 6
this 0 62 6
location, 0 62 6
but 0 62 6
they 0 62 6
(FBI) 0 62 6
didn’t 0 62 6
feel 0 62 6
there 0 62 6
was 0 62 6
enough 0 62 6
probable 0 62 6
cause 0 62 6
to 0 62 6
get 0 62 6
on 0 62 6
the 0 62 6

In 0 62 7
the 0 62 7
press 0 62 7
release 0 62 7
Sheriff 0 62 7
Hogrefe 0 62 7
said, 0 62 7
“That 0 62 7
all 0 62 7
changed 0 62 7
for 0 62 7
me 0 62 7
when 0 62 7
a 0 62 7
message 0 62 7
was 0 62 7
forwarded 0 62 7
to 0 62 7
us 0 62 7
from 0 62 7
a 0 62 7
Georgia 0 62 7
Detective 0 62 7
that 0 62 7
we 0 62 7
reasonably 0 62 7
believed 0 62 7
came 0 62 7
from 0 62 7
someone 0 62 7
at 0 62 7
the 0 62 7
compound 0 62 7
– 0 62 7
the 0 62 7
message 0 62 7
sent 0 62 7
to 0 62 7
a 0 62 7
third 0 62 7
party 0 62 7
simply 0 62 7
said 0 62 7
in 0 62 7
part 0 62 7
“we 0 62 7
are 0 62 7
starving 0 62 7
and 0 62 7
need 0 62 7
food 0 62 7
and 0 62 7
water”. 0 62 7

I 0 62 8
absolutely 0 62 8
knew 0 62 8
that 0 62 8
we 0 62 8
couldn’t 0 62 8
wait 0 62 8
on 0 62 8
another 0 62 8
agency 0 62 8
to 0 62 8
step 0 62 8
up 0 62 8
and 0 62 8
we 0 62 8
had 0 62 8
to 0 62 8
go 0 62 8
check 0 62 8
this 0 62 8
out 0 62 8
as 0 62 8
soon 0 62 8
as 0 62 8
possible, 0 62 8
so 0 62 8
I 0 62 8
began 0 62 8
working 0 62 8
on 0 62 8
a 0 62 8
search 0 62 8
warrant 0 62 8
right 0 62 8
after 0 62 8
I 0 62 8
got 0 62 8
that 0 62 8
intercepted 0 62 8
message 0 62 8
– 0 62 8
it 0 62 8
had 0 62 8
to 0 62 8
be 0 62 8
a 0 62 8
search 0 62 8
warrant 0 62 8
and 0 62 8
a 0 62 8
tactical 0 62 8
approach 0 62 8
for 0 62 8
our 0 62 8
own 0 62 8
safety 0 62 8
because 0 62 8
we 0 62 8
had 0 62 8
learned 0 62 8
the 0 62 8
occupants 0 62 8
were 0 62 8
most 0 62 8
likely 0 62 8
heavily 0 62 8
armed 0 62 8
and 0 62 8
considered 0 62 8
extremist 1 62 8
of 1 62 8
the 1 62 8
Muslim 1 62 8
belief. 1 62 8

We 0 62 9
also 0 62 9
knew 0 62 9
from 0 62 9
the 0 62 9
layout 0 62 9
of 0 62 9
the 0 62 9
compound 0 62 9
they 0 62 9
would 0 62 9
have 0 62 9
an 0 62 9
advantage 0 62 9
if 0 62 9
we 0 62 9
didn’t 0 62 9
deploy 0 62 9
tactfully 0 62 9
and 0 62 9
quickly.” 0 62 9

The 0 62 11
“all 0 62 11
day” 0 62 11
operation 0 62 11
went 0 62 11
without 0 62 11
major 0 62 11
incident 0 62 11
or 0 62 11
any 0 62 11

but 0 62 11
when 0 62 11
encountered 0 62 11
both 0 62 11
men 0 62 11
initially 0 62 11
refused 0 62 11
to 0 62 11
follow 0 62 11
verbal 0 62 11
direction 0 62 11
and 0 62 11
Wahhaj 0 62 11
who 0 62 11
was 0 62 11
held 0 62 11
up 0 62 11
inside 0 62 11
the 0 62 11
compound 0 62 11

including 0 62 11
one 0 62 11
in 0 62 11
his 0 62 11
pocket 0 62 11
when 0 62 11
he 0 62 11
was 0 62 11
taken 0 62 11
down. 0 62 11

Many 0 62 12
more 0 62 12
rounds 0 62 12
of 0 62 12
ammo 0 62 12
were 0 62 12
found 0 62 12
in 0 62 12
the 0 62 12
makeshift 0 62 12

of 0 62 12
a 0 62 12
small 0 62 12

“The 0 62 13
only 0 62 13
food 0 62 13
We 0 62 13
saw 0 62 13
were 0 62 13
a 0 62 13

Hogrefe. 0 62 13

“But 0 62 14
what 0 62 14
was 0 62 14
most 1 62 14
surprising, 1 62 14
and 1 62 14
heartbreaking 1 62 14
was 0 62 14
when 0 62 14
the 0 62 14
team 0 62 14
located 0 62 14
a 0 62 14

also 0 62 15
located, 0 62 15
however, 0 62 15
it 0 62 15
is 0 62 15
not 0 62 15
clear 0 62 15
if 0 62 15
