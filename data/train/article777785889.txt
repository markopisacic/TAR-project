afternoon 0
Sheriff 0

3-year-old 0
AG 0
Wahhaj, 0
the 0

This 0
warrant 0
came 0
after 0
a 0
two-month 0
investigation 0
in 0
conjunction 0
with 0
Clayton 0
County, 0
Georgia 0
and 0
FBI 0
investigators. 0

According 0
to 0
Sheriff 0
Hogrefe 0
the 0
FBI 0
had 0
recently 0
provided 0
information 0
and 0
surveillance 0
on 0
this 0
location, 0
but 0
they 0
(FBI) 0
didn’t 0
feel 0
there 0
was 0
enough 0
probable 0
cause 0
to 0
get 0
on 0
the 0
property. 0

In 0
the 0
press 0
release 0
Sheriff 0
Hogrefe 0
said, 0
“That 0
all 0
changed 0
for 0
me 0
when 0
a 0
message 0
was 0
forwarded 0
to 0
us 0
from 0
a 0
Georgia 0
Detective 0
that 0
we 0
reasonably 0
believed 0
came 0
from 0
someone 0
at 0
the 0
compound 0
– 0
the 0
message 0
sent 0
to 0
a 0
third 0
party 0
simply 0
said 0
in 0
part 0
“we 0
are 0
starving 0
and 0
need 0
food 0
and 0
water”. 0

I 0
absolutely 0
knew 0
that 0
we 0
couldn’t 0
wait 0
on 0
another 0
agency 0
to 0
step 0
up 0
and 0
we 0
had 0
to 0
go 0
check 0
this 0
out 0
as 0
soon 0
as 0
possible, 0
so 0
I 0
began 0
working 0
on 0
a 0
search 0
warrant 0
right 0
after 0
I 0
got 0
that 0
intercepted 0
message 0
– 0
it 0
had 0
to 0
be 0
a 0
search 0
warrant 0
and 0
a 0
tactical 0
approach 0
for 0
our 0
own 0
safety 0
because 0
we 0
had 0
learned 0
the 0
occupants 0
were 0
most 0
likely 0
heavily 0
armed 0
and 0
considered 0
extremist 1
of 1
the 1
Muslim 1
belief. 1

We 0
also 0
knew 0
from 0
the 0
layout 0
of 0
the 0
compound 0
they 0
would 0
have 0
an 0
advantage 0
if 0
we 0
didn’t 0
deploy 0
tactfully 0
and 0
quickly.” 0

eight 0

Response 0
Team 0
(SRT) 0
were 0
assisted 0
by 0
four 0
members 0
of 0
the 0
State 0
OSI 0
unit 0
when 0
they 0
executed 0
the 0
search 0
warrant. 0

The 0
“all 0
day” 0
operation 0
went 0
without 0
major 0
incident 0
or 0
any 0
injuries, 0
but 0
when 0
encountered 0
both 0
men 0
initially 0
refused 0
to 0
follow 0
verbal 0
direction 0
and 0
Wahhaj 0
who 0
was 0
held 0
up 0
inside 0
the 0
compound 0
was 0
heavily 0
armed 0
with 0
an 0
AR15 0
rifle, 0
five 0
loaded 0
30 0
round 0
magazines, 0
and 0
four 0
loaded 0

including 0
one 0
in 0
his 0
pocket 0
when 0
he 0
was 0
taken 0
down. 0

Many 0
more 0
rounds 0
of 0
ammo 0
were 0
found 0
in 0
the 0
makeshift 0
compound 0
that 0
consists 0
of 0
a 0
small 0
travel 0
trailer 0
buried 0
in 0
the 0
ground 0
covered 0
by 0
plastic 0
with 0
no 0
water, 0
plumbing, 0
or 0
electricity. 0

“The 0
only 0
food 0
We 0
saw 0
were 0
a 0
few 0
potatoes 0
and 0
a 0
box 0
of 0
rice 0
in 0
the 0
filthy 0
trailer,” 0
said 0
Hogrefe. 0

“But 0
what 0
was 0
most 1
surprising, 1
and 1
heartbreaking 1
was 0
when 0
the 0
team 0
located 0
a 0
total 0
of 0
five 1
adults 1
and 1
11 1
children 1
that 1
looked 1
like 1
third 1

country 1
refugees 1
not 0
only 0
with 0
no 0
food 0
or 0
fresh 0
water, 0
but 0
with 0
no 0
shoes, 0
personal 0
hygiene 0

basically 0
dirty 1
rags 1
for 1
clothing.” 1

The 0
body 0
of 0
a 0
yound 0
boy 0
was 0
also 0
located, 0
however, 0
it 0
is 0
not 0
clear 0
if 0
the 0
boy 0
is 0
the 0
missing 0
child 0
from 0
Georgia. 0

Both 0
males 0
were 0
arrested; 0
Morton 0
was 0
charged 0
with 0
harboring 0
a 0
fugitive 0
and 0
Wahhaj 0
was 0
booked 0
on 0
his 0
no 0
bond 0
Georgia 0
warrant 0
for 0
child 0
abduction. 0

The 0

were 0
later 0
booked 0
in 0
the 0

“We 0
all 0
gave 0
the 0
kids 0
our 0
water 0
and 0
what 0
snacks 0
we 0
had 0
– 0
it 1
was 1
the 1
saddest 1
living 1
conditions 1
and 1
poverty 1
I 1
have 1
seen.” 1

None 0

the 0

would 0
give 0
statement 0
to 0
the 0
current 0
whereabouts 0
of 0
AG 0
Wahhaj, 0

it 0
is 0
reasonably 0
believed 0
he 0
was 0
there 0
a 0
few 0
weeks 0
