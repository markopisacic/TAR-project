The 0 11 11

And 0 11 12
there 0 11 12
is 0 11 12
widespread 0 11 12

Supporters 0 11 16
are 0 11 16
adamant 0 11 16
that 0 11 16
the 0 11 16
weekly 0 11 16
class 0 11 16
is 0 11 16
an 0 11 16
elective 0 11 16
meant 0 11 16
to 0 11 16
explore 0 11 16
the 0 11 16
history 0 11 16
and 0 11 16
literature 0 11 16
of 0 11 16

not 0 11 16

religious 0 11 16
belief. 0 11 16

“My 0 11 17
experience 0 11 17
with 0 11 17
it 0 11 17
has 0 11 17
been 0 11 17
very 0 11 17
positive. 0 11 17

I’ve 0 11 18
never 0 11 18
known 0 11 18
of 0 11 18
anyone 0 11 18
who 0 11 18
has 0 11 18
been 0 11 18
pressured 0 11 18

“Any 0 11 20

and 0 11 20
is 0 11 20
a 1 11 20
good 1 11 20
thing.” 1 11 20

Trenton’s 0 11 21
parents 0 11 21
also 0 11 21
find 0 11 21
it 0 11 21
hard 0 11 21
to 0 11 21
see 0 11 21
why 0 11 21
there 0 11 21
would 0 11 21
be 0 11 21
objections. 0 11 21

“I 0 11 22
think 0 11 22
it’s 0 11 22
a 0 11 22
great 0 11 22
program 0 11 22
mainly 0 11 22
because 0 11 22
it’s 0 11 22
the 0 11 22
only 0 11 22
chance 0 11 22
for 0 11 22
some 0 11 22
of 0 11 22
these 0 11 22

to 0 11 22
even 0 11 22
see 0 11 22
the 0 11 22

“More 0 11 23

I 0 11 23
don’t 0 11 23

it 0 11 23

The 0 11 24

be 0 11 24
there.” 0 11 24

Courtney 0 11 25
Tolliver, 0 11 25
26, 0 11 25
a 0 11 25
teacher 0 11 25
in 0 11 25
the 0 11 25
district, 0 11 25
agrees. 0 11 25

“It’s 0 11 26
not 0 11 26
teaching 0 11 26
religion, 0 11 26
but 0 11 26
it 0 11 26
teaches 0 11 26
character 0 11 26
and 0 11 26
respect 0 11 26
and 0 11 26
how 0 11 26
important 0 11 26
it 0 11 26
is 0 11 26
to 0 11 26
tell 0 11 26
the 0 11 26
truth,” 0 11 26
she 0 11 26

said. 0 11 27
“The 0 11 27
kids 0 11 27
love 0 11 27
it 0 11 27

the 0 11 27
ones 0 11 27
who 0 11 27
don’t 0 11 27

made 0 11 27

out.” 0 11 28
But 0 11 28
the 0 11 28
plaintiffs 0 11 28
in 0 11 28
the 0 11 28
suit 0 11 28
and 0 11 28
their 0 11 28
backers 0 11 28
argue 0 11 28
that 0 11 28
the 0 11 28
program’s 0 11 28
popularity 0 11 28
shouldn’t 0 11 28
matter 0 11 28
in 0 11 28
the 0 11 28
face 0 11 28
of 0 11 28
Supreme 0 11 28
Court 0 11 28
rulings 0 11 28
such 0 11 28
as 0 11 28
McCollum 0 11 28
v. 0 11 28
Board 0 11 28
of 0 11 28
Education 0 11 28
in 0 11 28

that 0 11 28

sponsoring 0 11 28
religious 0 11 28
activity. 0 11 28

The 0 11 29
suit 0 11 29
alleges 0 11 29
that 0 11 29
the 0 11 29
lessons 0 11 29
in 0 11 29
the 0 11 29
Mercer 0 11 29
schools 0 11 29
are 0 11 29
similar 0 11 29
to 0 11 29
what 0 11 29
a 0 11 29
child 0 11 29
would 0 11 29
hear 0 11 29
in 0 11 29
Sunday 0 11 29
school 0 11 29
and 0 11 29
that 0 11 29
they 0 11 29
advocate 0 11 29
the 0 11 29
Ten 0 11 29
Commandments 0 11 29
and 0 11 29
treat 0 11 29
stories 0 11 29
in 0 11 29
the 0 11 29
Bible 0 11 29
as 0 11 29
historical 0 11 29

fact. 0 11 30
The 0 11 30
suit 0 11 30
quotes 0 11 30
from 0 11 30
one 0 11 30
lesson: 0 11 30
“If 0 11 30
all 0 11 30
of 0 11 30
the 0 11 30
Israelites 0 11 30
had 0 11 30
chosen 0 11 30
to 0 11 30
follow 0 11 30
the 0 11 30
Ten 0 11 30
Commandments, 0 11 30
think 0 11 30
of 0 11 30
how 0 11 30
safe 0 11 30
and 0 11 30
happy 0 11 30
they 0 11 30
would 0 11 30
have 0 11 30
been.” 0 11 30
Another 0 11 30
lesson 0 11 30
asks 0 11 30
students 0 11 30
to 0 11 30
imagine 0 11 30
that 0 11 30
humans 0 11 30
and 0 11 30
dinosaurs 0 11 30
existed 0 11 30
at 0 11 30
the 0 11 30
same 0 11 30

time. 0 11 31
It 0 11 31
says: 0 11 31
“So 0 11 31
picture 0 11 31
Adam 0 11 31
being 0 11 31
able 0 11 31
to 0 11 31
crawl 0 11 31
up 0 11 31
on 0 11 31
the 0 11 31
back 0 11 31
of 0 11 31
a 0 11 31
dinosaur! 0 11 31

He 0 11 32
and 0 11 32
Eve 0 11 32

Wouldn’t 0 11 33
that 0 11 33

wild!” 0 11 34
The 0 11 34
district 0 11 34
declined 0 11 34
a 0 11 34
request 0 11 34
to 0 11 34

of 0 11 34

Elizabeth 0 11 35

who 0 11 35
describes 0 11 35
herself 0 11 35
as 0 11 35
agnostic, 0 11 35
is 0 11 35
one 0 11 35
of 0 11 35
the 0 11 35
plaintiffs 0 11 35
in 0 11 35

the 0 11 36
case. 0 11 36
Her 0 11 36

elementary 0 11 36

in 0 11 36

Deal 0 11 36
kept 0 11 36
her 0 11 36
out 0 11 36
of 0 11 36
the 0 11 36

Even 0 11 37
though 0 11 37
the 0 11 37
class 0 11 37
was 0 11 37

opted 0 11 37

out. 0 11 38
Her 0 11 38
daughter 0 11 38
was 0 11 38

a 0 11 39
book. 0 11 39
Bypassing 1 11 39
the 1 11 39
class 1 11 39
left 1 11 39
her 1 11 39
vulnerable 1 11 39
to 1 11 39

bullying. 1 11 40
Deal 0 11 40
said 0 11 40
other 0 11 40
students 0 11 40
told 0 11 40
her 0 11 40

her, 0 11 41
according 0 11 41
to 0 11 41
the 0 11 41

“You 1 11 41
