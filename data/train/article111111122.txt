Kavanaugh 0 7 0
Nomination 0 7 0
Is 0 7 0
Exploding 1 7 0
in 1 7 0
Trump’s 1 7 0
Face 1 7 0

The 0 7 1
president 0 7 1
is 0 7 1
doubling 0 7 1
down 0 7 1
on 0 7 1
an 0 7 1
increasingly 0 7 1
risky 0 7 1
candidate. 0 7 1

Justice 0 7 2
Anthony 0 7 2
Kennedy 0 7 2
gave 0 7 2
President 0 7 2
Donald 0 7 2
Trump 0 7 2
the 1 7 2
biggest 1 7 2
political 1 7 2
gift 1 7 2
possible 1 7 2
when 0 7 2
he 0 7 2
announced 0 7 2
his 0 7 2
resignation 0 7 2
in 0 7 2
the 0 7 2
spring. 0 7 2

Even 0 7 3
though 0 7 3
not 0 7 3
everything 0 7 3
that’s 0 7 3
gone 0 7 3
wrong 0 7 3
is 0 7 3
Trump’s 0 7 3
fault, 0 7 3
he 0 7 3
has 0 7 3
managed 0 7 3
to 0 7 3
make 0 7 3
a 0 7 3
complete 1 7 3
hash 1 7 3
of 0 7 3
Brett 0 7 3
Kavanaugh’s 0 7 3
nomination 0 7 3
to 0 7 3
fill 0 7 3
the 0 7 3
empty 0 7 3
seat 0 7 3
on 0 7 3
the 0 7 3
court. 0 7 3

It’s 0 7 4
a 0 7 4
good 0 7 4
example 0 7 4
of 0 7 4
how 1 7 4
badly 1 7 4
Trump 1 7 4
does 1 7 4
his 1 7 4
job 1 7 4
more 0 7 4
than 0 7 4
a 0 7 4
year 0 7 4
and 0 7 4
a 0 7 4
half 0 7 4
into 0 7 4
his 0 7 4
administration. 0 7 4

To 0 7 5
begin 0 7 5
with, 0 7 5
Trump 0 7 5
has 0 7 5
outsourced 0 7 5
his 0 7 5
judicial 0 7 5
nominations 0 7 5
to 0 7 5
outside, 0 7 5
party-aligned 0 7 5
groups, 0 7 5
the 0 7 5
Heritage 0 7 5
Foundation 0 7 5
and 0 7 5
the 0 7 5
Federalist 0 7 5
Society. 0 7 5

That 0 7 6
included 0 7 6
an 0 7 6
unusually 0 7 6
central 0 7 6
role 0 7 6
for 0 7 6
the 0 7 6
Federalist 0 7 6
Society’s 0 7 6
Leonard 0 7 6
Leo. 0 7 6

That 0 7 7
wasn’t 0 7 7
entirely 0 7 7
a 0 7 7
Trump 0 7 7
mistake. 0 7 7

His 0 7 8
decision 0 7 8
during 0 7 8
the 0 7 8
campaign 0 7 8
to 0 7 8
release 0 7 8
a 0 7 8
list 0 7 8
of 0 7 8
potential 0 7 8
justices 0 7 8
drafted 0 7 8
by 0 7 8
Leo 0 7 8
reflected 1 7 8
the 1 7 8
reality-TV 1 7 8
star’s 1 7 8
weakness 1 7 8
as 1 7 8
a 1 7 8
presidential 1 7 8
candidate. 1 7 8

The 0 7 9
party 0 7 9
was 0 7 9
worried 0 7 9
that 0 7 9
Trump 0 7 9
might 0 7 9
turn 0 7 9
out 0 7 9
not 0 7 9
to 0 7 9
be 0 7 9
a 0 7 9
conservative; 0 7 9
to 0 7 9
reassure 0 7 9
them, 0 7 9
he 0 7 9
publicly 0 7 9
committed 0 7 9
to 0 7 9
their 0 7 9
top 0 7 9
goal. 0 7 9

In 0 7 10
some 0 7 10
ways, 0 7 10
that’s 0 7 10
successful 0 7 10
coalition-building, 0 7 10
and 0 7 10
what 0 7 10
he’s 0 7 10
done 0 7 10
in 0 7 10
office 0 7 10
is 0 7 10
just 0 7 10
keeping 0 7 10
his 0 7 10
promises 0 7 10
on 0 7 10
judges. 0 7 10

Still, 0 7 11
it’s 0 7 11
one 0 7 11
thing 0 7 11
to 0 7 11
form 0 7 11
an 0 7 11
alliance 0 7 11
with 0 7 11
conservatives; 0 7 11
it’s 0 7 11
another 0 7 11
to 0 7 11
turn 0 7 11
the 0 7 11
whole 0 7 11
process 0 7 11
over 0 7 11
to 0 7 11
them. 0 7 11

We 0 7 12
don’t 0 7 12
know 0 7 12
to 0 7 12
what 0 7 12
extent 0 7 12
Kavanaugh 0 7 12
was 0 7 12
Trump’s 0 7 12
choice 0 7 12
and 0 7 12
to 0 7 12
what 0 7 12
extent 0 7 12
he 0 7 12
was 0 7 12
manipulated 0 7 12
into 0 7 12
choosing 0 7 12
him. 0 7 12

We 0 7 13
have 0 7 13
plenty 0 7 13
of 0 7 13
evidence 0 7 13
that 0 7 13
Trump 1 7 13
is 1 7 13
easily 1 7 13
manipulated 1 7 13
by 1 7 13
those 1 7 13
around 1 7 13
him, 1 7 13
and 0 7 13
that 0 7 13
Kavanaugh 0 7 13
is 0 7 13
a 0 7 13
good 0 7 13
fit 0 7 13
for 0 7 13
Trump’s 0 7 13
biases: 0 7 13
The 0 7 13
judge 0 7 13
has 0 7 13
Ivy 0 7 13
League 0 7 13
credentials 0 7 13
and 0 7 13
he 0 7 13
passes 0 7 13
Trump’s 0 7 13
cut-of-his-jib 1 7 13
test 1 7 13
by 0 7 13
looking 0 7 13
the 0 7 13
part. 0 7 13

1 0 7 14

Either 0 7 15
way, 0 7 15
Kavanaugh 0 7 15
was 0 7 15
a 0 7 15
poor 0 7 15
choice 0 7 15
from 0 7 15
the 0 7 15
point 0 7 15
of 0 7 15
view 0 7 15
of 0 7 15
good 0 7 15
presidenting. 0 7 15

The 0 7 16
judge 0 7 16
was 0 7 16
certain 0 7 16
to 0 7 16
be 0 7 16
a 0 7 16
highly 0 7 16
controversial 0 7 16
selection 0 7 16
from 0 7 16
the 0 7 16
start. 0 7 16

After 0 7 17
all, 0 7 17
he 0 7 17
had 0 7 17
been 0 7 17
a 0 7 17
highly 0 7 17
controversial 0 7 17
selection 0 7 17
for 0 7 17
his 0 7 17
current 0 7 17
circuit 0 7 17
court 0 7 17
seat, 0 7 17
eventually 0 7 17
getting 0 7 17
confirmed 0 7 17
with 0 7 17
only 0 7 17
four 0 7 17
Democratic 0 7 17
votes 0 7 17
after 0 7 17
a 0 7 17
long 0 7 17
delay. 0 7 17

Kavanaugh 0 7 18
is 0 7 18
a 0 7 18
longtime 0 7 18
Republican 0 7 18
operative, 0 7 18
a 0 7 18
hard-liner 0 7 18
during 0 7 18
both 0 7 18
the 0 7 18
Vince 0 7 18
Foster 0 7 18
and 0 7 18
Monica 0 7 18
Lewinsky 0 7 18
investigations. 0 7 18

Nominating 0 7 19
him, 0 7 19
rather 0 7 19
than 0 7 19
a 0 7 19
conservative 0 7 19
with 0 7 19
similar 0 7 19
views 0 7 19
but 0 7 19
a 0 7 19
different 0 7 19
background, 0 7 19
was 0 7 19
bound 0 7 19
to 0 7 19
stir 0 7 19
up 0 7 19
trouble. 0 7 19

It 0 7 20
was 0 7 20
also 0 7 20
true, 0 7 20
as 0 7 20
Senate 0 7 20
Majority 0 7 20
Leader 0 7 20
Mitch 0 7 20
McConnell 0 7 20
reportedly 0 7 20
warned, 0 7 20
that 0 7 20
normal 0 7 20
disclosure 0 7 20
of 0 7 20
Kavanaugh’s 0 7 20
record, 0 7 20
especially 0 7 20
his 0 7 20
service 0 7 20
during 0 7 20
the 0 7 20
George 0 7 20
W. 0 7 20
Bush 0 7 20
administration, 0 7 20
was 0 7 20
going 0 7 20
to 0 7 20
delay 0 7 20
confirmation 0 7 20
even 0 7 20
more. 0 7 20

Senate 0 7 21
Republicans 0 7 21
dealt 0 7 21
with 0 7 21
that 0 7 21
problem 0 7 21
by 0 7 21
deciding 0 7 21
to 0 7 21
not 0 7 21
bother 0 7 21
with 0 7 21
any 0 7 21
Kavanaugh 0 7 21
documents 0 7 21
that 0 7 21
couldn’t 0 7 21
be 0 7 21
produced 0 7 21
rapidly, 0 7 21
which 0 7 21
further 0 7 21
riled 0 7 21
up 0 7 21
the 0 7 21
Democrats 0 7 21
and 0 7 21
gave 0 7 21
that 0 7 21
party 0 7 21
some 0 7 21
good 0 7 21
talking 0 7 21
points. 0 7 21

2 0 7 22

Sometimes 0 7 23
it’s 0 7 23
worth 0 7 23
taking 0 7 23

risks. 0 7 24
Presidents 0 7 24
who 0 7 24
shy 0 7 24
away 0 7 24
from 0 7 24
anything 0 7 24
that’s 0 7 24
not 0 7 24
a 0 7 24
sure 0 7 24
thing 0 7 24
can 0 7 24
fail 0 7 24
to 0 7 24
exploit 0 7 24
opportunities. 0 7 24

It’s 0 7 25
just 0 7 25
very 0 7 25
hard 0 7 25
to 0 7 25
see 0 7 25
any 0 7 25
upside 0 7 25
for 0 7 25
Trump 0 7 25
in 0 7 25
choosing 0 7 25
Kavanaugh 0 7 25
instead 0 7 25
of 0 7 25
a 0 7 25
safer, 0 7 25
but 0 7 25
still 0 7 25
very 0 7 25
conservative, 0 7 25
other 0 7 25
option. 0 7 25

3 0 7 26

When 0 7 27
serious 0 7 27
charges 0 7 27
of 0 7 27
sexual 0 7 27
misconduct 0 7 27
were 0 7 27
raised 0 7 27
against 0 7 27
Kavanaugh, 0 7 27
Trump 0 7 27
decided 0 7 27
to 0 7 27
stick 0 7 27
with 0 7 27
him 0 7 27
instead 0 7 27
of 0 7 27
moving 0 7 27
on 0 7 27
to 0 7 27
another 0 7 27
candidate. 0 7 27

It’s 0 7 28
still 0 7 28
not 0 7 28
clear 0 7 28
that 0 7 28
Kavanaugh’s 0 7 28
nomination 0 7 28
is 0 7 28
doomed, 0 7 28
but 0 7 28
it’s 0 7 28
certainly 0 7 28
in 0 7 28
severe 1 7 28
trouble. 1 7 28

Losing 0 7 29
a 0 7 29
high-profile 0 7 29
fight 0 7 29
is 0 7 29
always 0 7 29
going 0 7 29
to 0 7 29
hurt 0 7 29
a 0 7 29
president, 0 7 29
which 0 7 29
is 0 7 29
why 0 7 29
they 0 7 29
should 0 7 29
take 0 7 29
care 0 7 29
to 0 7 29
avoid 0 7 29
high-risk, 0 7 29
low-reward 0 7 29
conflicts. 0 7 29

But 0 7 30
there’s 0 7 30
an 0 7 30
art 0 7 30
to 0 7 30
minimizing 0 7 30

damage. 0 7 31
And 0 7 31
Trump 1 7 31
hasn’t 1 7 31
learned 1 7 31

it 1 7 32
yet. 1 7 32
For 0 7 32
one 0 7 32
thing, 0 7 32
the 0 7 32
president 0 7 32
has 0 7 32
made 0 7 32
this 0 7 32
an 0 7 32
extremely 1 7 32
high-profile 1 7 32
episode 1 7 32
by 0 7 32
stringing 0 7 32
out 0 7 32
the 0 7 32
process 0 7 32
as 0 7 32
the 0 7 32
accusations 0 7 32
against 0 7 32
Kavanaugh 0 7 32
gained 0 7 32
credibility 0 7 32
and 0 7 32
even 0 7 32
multiplied. 0 7 32

Whether 0 7 33
that 0 7 33
matters 0 7 33
in 0 7 33
terms 0 7 33
of 0 7 33
public 0 7 33
opinion 0 7 33
for 0 7 33
Trump 0 7 33
is 0 7 33
unclear, 0 7 33
but 0 7 33
it 0 7 33
certainly 0 7 33
isn’t 0 7 33
good 0 7 33
for 0 7 33
any 0 7 33
Republican 0 7 33
senators 0 7 33
caught 0 7 33
up 0 7 33
in 0 7 33
the 0 7 33
middle, 0 7 33
along 0 7 33
with 0 7 33
any 0 7 33
other 0 7 33
candidates 0 7 33
who 0 7 33
have 0 7 33
had 0 7 33
to 0 7 33
weigh 0 7 33
in 0 7 33
only 0 7 33
to 0 7 33
find 0 7 33
the 0 7 33
facts 0 7 33
as 0 7 33
they 0 7 33
knew 0 7 33
them 0 7 33
constantly 0 7 33
changing. 0 7 33

It’s 0 7 34
also 0 7 34
the 0 7 34
case 0 7 34
that 0 7 34
the 0 7 34
more 0 7 34
negative 0 7 34
information 0 7 34
comes 0 7 34
out, 0 7 34
the 0 7 34
more 0 7 34
it 0 7 34
appears 0 7 34
that 0 7 34
the 0 7 34
Trump 1 7 34
and 1 7 34
his 1 7 34
White 1 7 34
House 1 7 34
staff 1 7 34
failed 1 7 34
to 1 7 34
do 1 7 34
their 1 7 34
jobs 1 7 34
in 0 7 34
vetting 0 7 34
and 0 7 34
managing 0 7 34
Kavanaugh. 0 7 34

If 0 7 35
the 0 7 35
nomination 0 7 35
had 0 7 35
been 0 7 35
pulled 0 7 35
right 0 7 35
after 0 7 35
Christine 0 7 35
Blasey 0 7 35
Ford 0 7 35
made 0 7 35
her 0 7 35
initial 0 7 35
assertions 0 7 35
about 0 7 35
Kavanaugh, 0 7 35
the 0 7 35
public 0 7 35
might 0 7 35
have 0 7 35
concluded 0 7 35
that 0 7 35
it 0 7 35
wasn’t 0 7 35
Trump’s 0 7 35
fault 0 7 35
that 0 7 35
a 0 7 35
previously 0 7 35
unaired 0 7 35
accusation 0 7 35
came 0 7 35

to 0 7 36
light. 0 7 36
Meanwhile, 0 7 36
Trump’s 0 7 36
behavior 0 7 36
has 0 7 36
been 0 7 36
as 0 7 36
erratic 0 7 36

as 0 7 37
ever. 0 7 37
First 0 7 37
he 0 7 37
said 0 7 37
that 0 7 37
Brasey 0 7 37
had 0 7 37
to 0 7 37
be 0 7 37
heard; 0 7 37
then 0 7 37
he 0 7 37
attacked 0 7 37
her 0 7 37
in 0 7 37
terms 0 7 37
that 0 7 37
were 0 7 37
a 1 7 37
slur 1 7 37
on 1 7 37
all 1 7 37
women 1 7 37
who 0 7 37
have 0 7 37
been 0 7 37
assaulted 0 7 37
without 0 7 37
immediately 0 7 37
reporting 0 7 37
it 0 7 37
to 0 7 37
the 0 7 37
police, 0 7 37
and 0 7 37
he 0 7 37
also 0 7 37
blamed 0 7 37
the 0 7 37
Senate 0 7 37
for 0 7 37
not 0 7 37
voting 0 7 37
before 0 7 37
she 0 7 37
came 0 7 37

forward. 0 7 38
He 0 7 38
sometimes 0 7 38
praises 0 7 38
Kavanaugh, 0 7 38
but 0 7 38
also 0 7 38
let 0 7 38
it 0 7 38
be 0 7 38
known 0 7 38
that 0 7 38
he 0 7 38
thought 0 7 38
the 0 7 38
nominee 0 7 38
had 0 7 38
performed 0 7 38
badly 0 7 38
in 0 7 38
his 0 7 38
Fox 0 7 38
News 0 7 38

interview. 0 7 39
The 0 7 39
White 0 7 39
House 0 7 39
demanded 0 7 39
a 0 7 39
final 0 7 39
up 0 7 39
and 0 7 39
down 0 7 39
vote 0 7 39
on 0 7 39
Tuesday; 0 7 39
by 0 7 39
Wednesday, 0 7 39
he 0 7 39
was 0 7 39
saying 0 7 39
that 0 7 39
the 0 7 39
nomination 0 7 39
would 0 7 39
die 0 7 39
if 0 7 39
Kavanaugh 0 7 39
didn’t 0 7 39
do 0 7 39
well 0 7 39
before 0 7 39
the 0 7 39
Judiciary 0 7 39
Committee 0 7 39
on 0 7 39

Thursday. 0 7 40
The 0 7 40
sum 0 7 40
of 0 7 40
all 0 7 40
this 0 7 40
has 0 7 40
been, 0 7 40
as 0 7 40
in 0 7 40
many 0 7 40
other 0 7 40
episodes, 0 7 40
that 0 7 40
Trump 0 7 40
and 0 7 40
his 0 7 40
White 0 7 40
House 0 7 40
are 0 7 40
a 1 7 40
gang 1 7 40
that 1 7 40
can’t 1 7 40
shoot 1 7 40
straight 1 7 40
and 0 7 40
that 0 7 40
he’s 0 7 40
eager 0 7 40
to 0 7 40
blame 0 7 40
his 0 7 40
allies 0 7 40
and 0 7 40
lash 0 7 40
out 0 7 40
at 0 7 40
his 0 7 40
enemies 0 7 40
in 0 7 40
ugly 1 7 40
ways 1 7 40
when 0 7 40
things 0 7 40

go 0 7 41
wrong. 0 7 41
A 0 7 41
botched 0 7 41
nomination 0 7 41
matters 0 7 41
because 0 7 41
allies 0 7 41
will 0 7 41
be 0 7 41
less 0 7 41
likely 0 7 41
to 0 7 41
trust 0 7 41
Trump, 0 7 41
not 0 7 41
just 0 7 41
on 0 7 41
Supreme 0 7 41
Court 0 7 41
choices, 0 7 41
but 0 7 41
on 0 7 41
any 0 7 41

initiative. 0 7 42
And, 0 7 42
for 0 7 42
that 0 7 42
matter, 0 7 42
they’ll 0 7 42
be 0 7 42
less 0 7 42
likely 0 7 42
to 0 7 42
trust 0 7 42
him 0 7 42
when 0 7 42
he 0 7 42
asserts 0 7 42
that 0 7 42
there’s 0 7 42
nothing 0 7 42
remaining 0 7 42
for 0 7 42
Special 0 7 42
Counsel 0 7 42
Robert 0 7 42
Mueller 0 7 42

to 0 7 43
reveal. 0 7 43
Trump’s 0 7 43
professional 0 7 43
reputation 0 7 43
is 0 7 43
already 0 7 43
terrible, 0 7 43
but 0 7 43
everything 0 7 43

counts. 0 7 44
As 1 7 44
the 1 7 44
political 1 7 44
scientist 1 7 44
Richard 1 7 44
Neustadt 1 7 44
said, 1 7 44
political 1 7 44
elites 1 7 44
are 1 7 44
constantly 1 7 44
evaluating 1 7 44
and 1 7 44
re-evaluating 1 7 44
the 1 7 44

president. 1 7 45
Trump 0 7 45
is 0 7 45
hurting 0 7 45
himself 0 7 45
right 0 7 45
now, 0 7 45
and 0 7 45
will 0 7 45
have 0 7 45
hurt 0 7 45
himself 0 7 45
more 0 7 45
if 0 7 45
Kavanaugh 0 7 45
is 0 7 45
not 0 7 45

confirmed. 0 7 46
And 0 7 46
yes, 0 7 46
I 0 7 46
call 0 7 46
it 0 7 46
the 0 7 46
cut-of-his-jib 1 7 46
test 1 7 46
quite 0 7 46
deliberately. 0 7 46

It's 0 7 47
no 0 7 47
surprise 0 7 47
that 0 7 47
someone 1 7 47
who 1 7 47
hires 1 7 47
based 1 7 47
on 1 7 47
what 1 7 47
he 1 7 47
thinks 1 7 47
someone 1 7 47
doing 1 7 47
that 1 7 47
job 1 7 47
should 1 7 47
look 1 7 47
like, 1 7 47
which 0 7 47
seems 0 7 47
to 0 7 47
be 0 7 47
based 0 7 47
on 0 7 47
hazy 1 7 47
old-time 1 7 47
Hollywood 1 7 47
casting, 1 7 47
would 0 7 47
wind 0 7 47
up 0 7 47
with 0 7 47
fewer 0 7 47
women 0 7 47
in 0 7 47
his 0 7 47
administration 0 7 47
than 0 7 47
any 0 7 47
of 0 7 47
his 0 7 47
recent 0 7 47
predecessors. 0 7 47

I've 0 7 48
argued 0 7 48
that 0 7 48
too 0 7 48
much 0 7 48
disclosure 0 7 48
is 0 7 48
required, 0 7 48
and 0 7 48
that 0 7 48
Democrats 0 7 48
(and 0 7 48
any 0 7 48
wavering 0 7 48
Republicans) 0 7 48
had 0 7 48
more 0 7 48
than 0 7 48
enough 0 7 48
information 0 7 48
to 0 7 48
make 0 7 48
up 0 7 48

their 0 7 49
mind. 0 7 49
I 0 7 49
still 0 7 49
think 0 7 49

that's 0 7 50
true. 0 7 50
But 0 7 50
it 0 7 50
did 0 7 50
leave 0 7 50
Republicans 0 7 50
vulnerable 0 7 50
to 0 7 50
claims 0 7 50
about 0 7 50
transparency 0 7 50
which 0 7 50
were 0 7 50
likely 0 7 50
to 0 7 50
be 0 7 50
popular 0 7 50
-- 0 7 50
most 0 7 50
people, 0 7 50
and 0 7 50
the 0 7 50
entire 0 7 50
press 0 7 50
corps, 0 7 50
love 0 7 50
transparency 0 7 50
-- 0 7 50
and 0 7 50
vulnerable 0 7 50
to 0 7 50
bombshells 1 7 50
in 0 7 50
the 0 7 50
documentary 0 7 50
record 0 7 50
which 0 7 50
hadn't 0 7 50
been 0 7 50
initially 0 7 50

disclosed. 0 7 51
In 0 7 51
the 0 7 51
event, 0 7 51
that's 0 7 51
not 0 7 51
what's 0 7 51
causing 0 7 51
the 0 7 51
trouble, 0 7 51
but 0 7 51
still 0 7 51
it's 0 7 51
an 0 7 51
example 0 7 51
of 0 7 51
Trump 0 7 51
taking 0 7 51
needless 0 7 51

risks. 0 7 52
Some 0 7 52
have 0 7 52
speculated 0 7 52
that 0 7 52
Kavanaugh 0 7 52
would 0 7 52
be 0 7 52
especially 0 7 52
likely 0 7 52
to 0 7 52
rule 0 7 52
in 0 7 52
Trump's 0 7 52
favor 0 7 52
if 0 7 52
any 0 7 52
cases 0 7 52
stemming 0 7 52
from 0 7 52
the 0 7 52
Robert 0 7 52
Mueller 0 7 52
investigation 0 7 52
wind 0 7 52
up 0 7 52
at 0 7 52
the 0 7 52

high 0 7 53
court. 0 7 53

Perhaps. 0 7 54
There 0 7 54
are 0 7 54
plenty 0 7 54
of 0 7 54
other 0 7 54
partisan, 1 7 54
conservative 1 7 54
judges, 1 7 54
and 0 7 54
plenty 0 7 54
of 0 7 54
conservative 0 7 54
judges 0 7 54
who 0 7 54
lean 0 7 54
towards 0 7 54
an 0 7 54
expansive 0 7 54
view 0 7 54
of 0 7 54
presidential 0 7 54

powers. 0 7 55
And 0 7 55
if 0 7 55
Kavanaugh 0 7 55
is 0 7 55
really 0 7 55
an 0 7 55
outlier 0 7 55
on 0 7 55
that 0 7 55
issue, 0 7 55
then 0 7 55
he 0 7 55
won't 0 7 55
be 0 7 55
in 0 7 55
the 0 7 55
majority 0 7 55
on 0 7 55
any 0 7 55
future 0 7 55
decision 0 7 55

anyway. 0 7 55

So, 0 7 55

no, 0 7 55

I 0 7 55

don't 0 7 55

think 0 7 55

there's 0 7 55

any 0 7 55

good 0 7 55

reason 0 7 55

to 0 7 55

think 0 7 55

Kavanaugh 0 7 55

would 0 7 55

be 0 7 55

especially 0 7 55

helpful 0 7 55

to 0 7 55

Trump 0 7 55

compared 0 7 55

to 0 7 55

others 0 7 55

he 0 7 55

could 0 7 55

have 0 7 55

selected. 0 7 55
