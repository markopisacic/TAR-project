But 1 94 15
who 1 94 15

this 1 94 15

of 0 94 15

And 0 94 23
the 0 94 23

up 1 94 24
to 1 94 24
that 1 94 24

As 0 94 26
for 0 94 26
Syria's 0 94 26

casting 0 94 26
their 0 94 26
lot 0 94 26
with 0 94 26
the 0 94 26
Americans, 0 94 26
one 0 94 26
wonders: 0 94 26
Did 0 94 26
they 0 94 26
not 0 94 26
observe 0 94 26
what 0 94 26

as 0 94 26
their 0 94 26
U.S. 0 94 26

watched? 0 94 26

In 0 94 27
the 0 94 27
six-year 0 94 27
Syrian 0 94 27
civil 0 94 27
war, 0 94 27
which 0 94 27
may 0 94 27

a 0 94 27
new 0 94 27
phase, 0 94 27
America 0 94 27
faces 0 94 27
a 0 94 27
familiar 0 94 27
situation. 0 94 27

While 0 94 28
our 0 94 28
"allies" 0 94 28

adversaries 0 94 28
have 0 94 28
vital 0 94 28

not. 0 94 28

The 0 94 29
Assads 0 94 29

for 0 94 29
the 0 94 29
lifetime 0 94 29
of 0 94 29

Americans. 0 94 29

And 0 94 30
we 0 94 30
Americans 0 94 30
have 0 94 30
never 0 94 30
shown 0 94 30

there. 0 94 30

of 0 94 31

country. 0 94 31

The 0 94 32
Turks 0 94 32
have 0 94 32
a 0 94 32

in 0 94 32
keeping 0 94 32
