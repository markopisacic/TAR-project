But 0 163 7
Haig 0 163 7
says 0 163 7
he 0 163 7
had 0 163 7
no 0 163 7
idea 0 163 7

he 0 163 7
met 0 163 7
him 0 163 7
just 0 163 7
a 0 163 7
few 0 163 7
weeks 0 163 7
before 0 163 7
the 0 163 7

Haig 0 163 8
says 0 163 8
he 0 163 8
sold 0 163 8
Paddock 0 163 8
720 0 163 8
rounds 0 163 8
of 0 163 8
ammunition 0 163 8

Haig's 0 163 8

"I 0 163 9
couldn't 0 163 9
detect 0 163 9
anything 0 163 9
wrong 0 163 9
with 0 163 9
this 0 163 9
guy," 0 163 9
he 0 163 9
said. 0 163 9

"He 0 163 10
told 0 163 10
me 0 163 10
exactly 0 163 10
what 0 163 10
he 0 163 10
wanted. 0 163 10

I 0 163 11
handed 0 163 11
him 0 163 11
a 0 163 11
box 0 163 11
with 0 163 11
the 0 163 11
ammunition 0 163 11
in 0 163 11
it, 0 163 11

he 0 163 11
paid 0 163 11
me 0 163 11

he 0 163 11
left." 0 163 11

The 0 163 12
rounds 0 163 12
he 0 163 12
sold 0 163 12
are 0 163 12
called 0 163 12
"tracer 0 163 12
ammunition" 0 163 12
– 0 163 12
bullets 0 163 12
that 0 163 12
leave 0 163 12
a 0 163 12
visible 0 163 12
trail 0 163 12
when 0 163 12
fired. 0 163 12

"He 0 163 13

he 0 163 13
was 0 163 13
going 0 163 13
to 0 163 13

And 0 163 14
I 0 163 14
can't 0 163 14
remember 0 163 14
whether 0 163 14
he 0 163 14
said 0 163 14
for 0 163 14
or 0 163 14
with 0 163 14
his 0 163 14
friends, 0 163 14

that's 0 163 14
what 0 163 14
he 0 163 14
did 0 163 14
say," 0 163 14

"may 0 163 15
have 0 163 15

Haig 0 163 16
strongly 0 163 16
denies 0 163 16
that. 0 163 16

"I 0 163 17
felt 0 163 17
that 0 163 17
they 0 163 17
were 0 163 17
hoping 0 163 17
that 0 163 17
they 0 163 17
could 0 163 17
find 0 163 17
a 0 163 17
connection 0 163 17
between 0 163 17
myself 0 163 17
and 0 163 17
Paddock, 0 163 17
that 0 163 17
would 0 163 17
go 0 163 17
back 0 163 17
showing 0 163 17
that 0 163 17
I 0 163 17
supplied 0 163 17
him 0 163 17
with 0 163 17
most 0 163 17
of 0 163 17
his 0 163 17
ammunition, 0 163 17
possibly 0 163 17
even 0 163 17
some 0 163 17
firearms," 0 163 17
Haig 0 163 17
said. 0 163 17

"They're 0 163 18
not 0 163 18
gonna 0 163 18
find 0 163 18
it. 0 163 18

I 0 163 19

three 0 163 19

It's 0 163 20
unclear 0 163 20
whether 0 163 20

is 0 163 20
still 0 163 20
a 0 163 20

does 0 163 23
not 0 163 23

himself, 0 163 23

within 0 163 23
weeks 0 163 23
of 0 163 23
the 0 163 23
