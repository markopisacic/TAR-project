Reid 0
Wilson, 0
a 0
correspondent 0
for 0
the 0
Hill, 0
has 0
posted 0
to 0
Twitter 0
a 0
year 0
by 0
year 0
breakdown 0
of 0
sexual 0
harassment 0
settlements 0
and 0
awards 0
that 0
he 0
received 0
from 0
the 0
Congressional 0
Office 0
of 0
Compliance. 0

I 0
went 0
ahead 0
and 0
added 0
up 0
each 0
column, 0
and 0
what 0
I 0
discovered 0
is 0
that 0
264 0
cases 0
of 0
sexual 0
harassment 0
in 0
Congress 0
have 0
been 0
settled 0
since 0
1997, 0
and 0
the 0
total 0
amount 0
awarded 0
in 0
those 0
settlements 0
comes 0
to 0
a 0
grand 0
total 0
of 0
$17,250,854. 0

So 0
where 0
has 0
the 0
$17,250,854 0
come 0
from 0
to 0
pay 0
those 0
settlements? 0

That 1
money 1
has 1
come 1
from 1
the 1
taxpayers 1
of 1
course. 1

That 0
means 0
that 0
you 0
and 0
I 0
have 0
been 0
paying 0
to 0
cover 0
up 0
the 1
epidemic 1
of 1
sexual 1
harassment 1
that 0
has 0
been 0
taking 0
place 0
on 0
Capitol 0
Hill. 0

When 0
U.S. 0
Representative 0
Jackie 0
Speier 0
originally 0
told 0
us 0
that 0
more 0
than 0
15 0
million 0
dollars 0
had 0
been 0
paid 0
out 0
to 0
victims 0
of 0
sexual 0
harassment 0
in 0
recent 0
years, 0
I 0
was 0
envisioning 0
a 0
few 0
dozen 0
cases 0
at 0
most. 0

I 0
had 0
no 0
idea 0
that 0
the 0
total 0
number 0
of 0
cases 0
would 0
actually 0
be 0
well 0
over 0
200. 0

If 0
our 0
leaders 0
were 0
serious 0
about 0
stopping 0
this 0
from 0
happening, 0
they 0
would 0
pass 0
a 0
law 0
making 0
it 0
mandatory 0
that 0
all 0
cases 0
of 0
sexual 0
harassment 0
in 0
Congress 0
be 0
made 0
public, 0
and 0
that 0
members 0
of 0
Congress 0
would 0
be 0
personally 0
responsible 0
for 0
paying 0
out 0
any 0
settlements. 0

If 1
such 1
a 1
law 1
was 1
instituted, 1
I 1
guarantee 1
you 1
that 1
sexual 1
harassment 1
on 1
Capitol 1
Hill 1
would 1
come 1
to 1
a 1
screeching 1
halt. 1

But 0
they 0
don’t 0
want 0
it 0
to 0
stop. 0

For 1
many 1
in 1
Congress, 1
having 1
so 1
many 1
attractive 1
young 1
women 1
around 1
is 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
key 1
benefits 1
of 1
the 1
job. 1

I 0
included 0
the 0
following 0
quote 0
from 0
CNN 0
in 0
an 0
article 0
the 0
other 0
day, 0
but 0
I 0
also 0
believe 0
that 0
it 0
fits 0
just 0
perfectly 0
here… 0

In 0
an 0
environment 0
with 0
“so 0
many 0
young 0
women,” 0
said 0
one 0
ex-House 0
aide, 0
the 1
men 1
“have 1
no 1
self-control.” 1
“Amongst 0
ourselves, 0
we 0
know,” 0
a 0
former 0
Senate 0
staffer 0
said 0
of 0
the 1
lawmakers 1
with 1
the 1
worst 1
reputations. 1

And 0
sometimes, 0
the 0
sexual 0
advances 0
from 0
members 0
of 0
Congress 0
or 0
senior 0
aides 0
are 0
reciprocated 0
in 0
the 0
hopes 0
of 0
advancing 0
one’s 0
career 0
— 0
what 0
one 0
political 0
veteran 0
bluntly 0
referred 0
to 0
as 0
a 0
“sex 1
trade 1
on 1
Capitol 1
Hill.” 1

Do 0
you 0
want 0
to 0
stop 0
this 0
from 0
happening? 0

It 1
isn’t 1
going 1
to 1
stop 1
until 1
we 1
boot 1
out 1
the 1
corrupt 1
career 1
politicians 1
that 1
are 1
engaging 1
in 1
this 1
type 1
of 1
behavior. 1

So 0
I 0
am 0
asking 0
you 0
to 0
support 0
my 0
campaign 0
and 0
other 0
“grassroots 1
deplorables” 1
that 0
are 0
running 0
for 0
office 0
all 0
over 0
the 0
nation. 0

Morality 0
really 0
matters 0
when 0
it 0
comes 0
to 0
serving 0
in 0
public 0
office, 0
and 0
we 0
are 0
not 0
going 0
to 0
send 0
people 0
that 0
engage 0
in 0
sexually 0
inappropriate 0
behavior 0
to 0
Washington 0
anymore. 0

And 0
I 0
am 0
calling 0
on 0
Congress 0
to 0
immediately 0
release 0
the 0
details 0
of 0
all 0
of 0
the 0
264 0
cases 0
of 0
sexual 0
harassment 0
that 0
have 0
been 0
settled 0
since 0
1997. 0

The 1
American 1
people 1
have 1
a 1
right 1
to 1
know, 1
and 0
those 0
that 0
engaged 0
in 0
this 0
type 0
of 0
behavior 0
do 0
not 0
have 0
a 0
right 0
to 0
hide. 0

It 0
is 0
time 0
to 0
drain 0
the 0
swamp, 0
and 0
this 0
would 0
be 0
a 0
really 0
good 0
place 0
to 0
start. 0
