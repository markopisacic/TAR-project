Clark 0
County 0
Nevada 0
Coroner 0
John 0
Fudenberg 0
has 0
determined 0
to 0
defy 0
a 0
court 0
order 0
from 0
a 0
district 0
court 0
judge 0
to 0
release 0
the 0
autopsy 0
report 0
of 0
Las 0

shooter 0
Stephen 0
Paddock. 0

Though 0
the 0
order 0
was 0
issued 0
on 0
Tuesday, 0
Fudenberg 0
conferred 0
with 0
others 0
and 0
seems 0
determined 0
to 0
not 0
release 0
the 0
autopsy 0
report 0
until, 0
as 0
he 0
said, 0
it 0
is 0
"finalized," 0
The 0
Las 0
Vegas 0
Review-Journal 0
reported, 0
which 0
sued 0
for 0
the 0
autopsy 0
report. 0

Seriously, 1
it's 0
been 0
four 0
months 0
already! 0

The 0
body 0
has 0
been 0
cremated! 0

The 1
family 1
finally 1
got 1
the 1
remains 1
in 1
a 1
box 1
marked 1
"evidence" 1
over 1
three 1
months 1
after 1
the 1
shooting 1
and 1
the 1
autopsy 1
report 1
hasn't 1
been 1
finalized? 1

Wait, 1
were 1
the 1
same 1
guys 1
in 1
the 1
autopsy 1
room 1
that 1
were 1
there 1
when 1
the 1
doctors 1
and 1
coroners 1
examined 1
John 1
F 1
Kennedy 1
? 0

“I 0
don’t 0
believe 0
this 0
is 0
consistent 0
with 0
what 0
the 0
court 0
ordered,” 0
said 0
Las 0
Vegas 0
attorney 0
Maggie 0
McLetchie, 0
who 0
represents 0
the 0
Las 0
Vegas 0
Review-Journal 0
and 0
The 0
Associated 0
Press 0
in 0
their 0
November 0
action 0
demanding 0
the 0
release 0
of 0
the 0
reports. 0

“They 0
(the 0
coroner’s 0
office) 0
have 0
delayed 0
this 0
for 0
too 0
long, 0
and 0
whatever 0
stage 0
the 0
coroner’s 0
report 0
on 0
Paddock 0
is 0
in, 0
it 0
should 0
be 0
provided 0
to 0
the 0
Review-Journal 0
and 0
Associated 0
Press 0
without 0
further 0
delay. 0

No 1
more 1
games. 1

Release 0
the 0
records.” 0

“The 0
court 0
correctly 0
recognized 0
the 0
presumption 0
of 0
public 0
access 0
to 0
records, 0
even 0
when 0
a 0
mass 0
tragedy 0
occurs,” 0
McLetchie 0
added. 0

“(The 0
judge) 0
also 0
rejected 0
arguments 0
by 0
the 0
coroner’s 0
office 0
that 0
there 0
were 0
any 0
privacy 0
interests 0
with 0
regards 0
to 0
the 0
autopsy 0
of 0
Stephen 0
Paddock, 0
let 0
alone 0
any 0
that 0
outweighed 0
the 0
strong 0
presumption 0
of 0
access 0
to 0
records 0
in 0
Nevada.” 0

“The 0
shooter’s 0
body 0
was 0
cremated 0
Dec. 0
21," 0
said 0
Review-Journal 0
Editor-in-Chief 0
Keith 0
Moyer 0
added. 0

"How 1
can 1
the 1
autopsy 1
report 1
not 1
be 1
‘finalized’ 1
when 1
the 1
body 1
was 1
cremated 1
more 1
than 1
five 1
weeks 1
ago? 1

The 0
law 0
is 0
squarely 0
on 0
the 0
side 0
of 0
the 0
public’s 0
right 0
to 0
open 0
government.” 0

That's 1
exactly 1
right! 1

Something 1
is 1
rotten 1
in 1
Denmark! 1

On 1
top 1
of 1
that, 1
we 1
have 1
questions 1
as 1
to 1
whether 1
the 1
body 1
was 1
even 1
that 1
of 1
Stephen 1
Paddock, 1
given 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
certain 1
elements 1
of 1
the 1
Paddock 1
in 1
the 1
preliminary 1
police 1
report, 1
which 1
mentioned 1
the 1
autopsy, 1
are 1
apparently 1
at 1
odds 1
with 1
the 1
Paddock 1
of 1
other 1
documentation. 1

McLetchie 0
has 0
been 0
trying 0
to 0
obtain 0
as 0
much 0
information 0
for 0
the 0
public 0
as 0
possible, 0
including 0
video 0
of 0
Paddock 0
at 0
the 0
Mandalay 0
Bay 0
Hotel 0
and 0
Casino. 0

However, 0
she 0
has 0
been 0
told 0
by 0
Las 0
Vegas 0
Metro 0
Police 0
Department 0
attornies 0
that 0
they 0
can't 0
release 0
that 0
information 0
until 0
they 0
finalize 0
their 0
investigation 0
into 0
other 0
suspects 0
which 0
may 0
also 0
produce 0
charges 0
in 0
the 0
case. 0

“The 0
coroner’s 0
office 0
has 0
fought 0
to 0
keep 0
autopsy 0
reports 0
confidential,” 0
the 0
Review-Journal. 0

The 0
coroner 0
was 0
ordered 0
on 0
January 0
11 0
to 0
pay 0
nearly 0
$32,000 0
in 0
legal 0
costs 0
to 0
the 0
Review-Journal 0
because 0
it 0
refused 0
to 0
release 0
public 0
records. 0

While 0
the 0
preliminary 0
report 0
indicated 0
the 0
Paddock 0
died 0
of 0
a 0
gun 0
shot 0
wound 0
to 0
the 0
head 0
through 0
the 0
mouth, 0
it's 0
all 0
the 0
details 0
that 0
aren't 0
given 0
that 0
seem 0
to 0
be 0
problematic 0
for 0
the 0
coroner 0
to 0
release. 0

By 1
the 1
way, 1
the 1
toxicology 1
report 1
was 1
not 1
mentioned 1
in 1
the 1
preliminary 1
report. 1
