For 0 92 4
decades, 0 92 4
Americans 0 92 4
have 0 92 4
known 0 92 4
that 0 92 4
very 1 92 4
sick 1 92 4
things 1 92 4
happen 0 92 4
behind 0 92 4
the 0 92 4
scenes 0 92 4
in 0 92 4
Washington 0 92 4
D.C., 0 92 4
but 0 92 4
the 0 92 4
mainstream 0 92 4
media 0 92 4
nearly 0 92 4
really 0 92 4
talks 0 92 4
about 0 92 4
any 0 92 4
of 0 92 4
it. 0 92 4

But 0 92 5
now 0 92 5
the 0 92 5
curtain 0 92 5
is 0 92 5
starting 0 92 5
to 0 92 5
be 0 92 5
pulled 0 92 5
back, 0 92 5
and 0 92 5
the 0 92 5
revelations 0 92 5
about 0 92 5
Al 0 92 5
Franken 0 92 5
are 0 92 5
just 0 92 5
the 0 92 5
beginning. 0 92 5

Earlier 0 92 6
this 0 92 6
week, 0 92 6
I 0 92 6
wrote 0 92 6
an 0 92 6
article 0 92 6
about 0 92 6
how 0 92 6
“sexual 1 92 6
harassment 1 92 6
is 1 92 6
rampant 1 92 6
in 1 92 6
the 1 92 6
halls 1 92 6
of 1 92 6
Congress”, 1 92 6
and 0 92 6
that 0 92 6
was 0 92 6
before 0 92 6
a 0 92 6
female 0 92 6
radio 0 92 6
anchor 0 92 6
named 0 92 6
LeeAnn 0 92 6
Tweeden 0 92 6
revealed 0 92 6
that 0 92 6
Al 0 92 6
Franken 0 92 6
had 0 92 6
“forcibly 0 92 6
kissed” 0 92 6
and 0 92 6
groped 0 92 6
her 0 92 6
during 0 92 6
a 0 92 6
USO 0 92 6
tour 0 92 6
in 0 92 6
2006. 0 92 6

The 0 92 7
following 0 92 7
comes 0 92 7
from 0 92 7
an 0 92 7
article 0 92 7
in 0 92 7
which 0 92 7
Tweeden 0 92 7
shared 0 92 7
her 0 92 7
story… 0 92 7

I 0 92 8
couldn’t 0 92 8
believe 0 92 8
it. 0 92 8

He 0 92 9
groped 0 92 9
me, 0 92 9
without 0 92 9
my 0 92 9
consent, 0 92 9
while 0 92 9
I 0 92 9
was 0 92 9
asleep. 0 92 9

I 1 92 10
felt 1 92 10
violated 1 92 10
all 1 92 10
over 1 92 10
again. 1 92 10

Embarrassed. 1 92 11

Belittled. 1 92 12

Humiliated. 1 92 13

How 0 92 14
dare 0 92 14
anyone 0 92 14
grab 0 92 14
my 0 92 14
breasts 0 92 14
like 0 92 14
this 0 92 14
and 0 92 14
think 0 92 14
it’s 0 92 14
funny? 0 92 14

I 0 92 15
told 0 92 15
my 0 92 15
husband 0 92 15
everything 0 92 15
that 0 92 15
happened 0 92 15
and 0 92 15
showed 0 92 15
him 0 92 15
the 0 92 15
picture. 0 92 15

I 0 92 16
wanted 0 92 16
to 0 92 16
shout 1 92 16
my 1 92 16
story 1 92 16
to 1 92 16
the 1 92 16
world 1 92 16
with 1 92 16
a 1 92 16
megaphone 1 92 16
to 0 92 16
anyone 0 92 16
who 0 92 16
would 0 92 16
listen, 0 92 16
but 0 92 16
even 0 92 16
as 0 92 16
angry 0 92 16
as 0 92 16
I 0 92 16
was, 0 92 16
I 0 92 16
was 0 92 16
worried 0 92 16
about 0 92 16
the 0 92 16
potential 0 92 16
backlash 0 92 16
and 0 92 16
damage 0 92 16
going 0 92 16
public 0 92 16
might 0 92 16
have 0 92 16
on 0 92 16
my 0 92 16
career 0 92 16
as 0 92 16
a 0 92 16
broadcaster. 0 92 16

But 0 92 17
that 0 92 17
was 0 92 17
then, 0 92 17
this 0 92 17
is 0 92 17
now. 0 92 17

I’m 1 92 18
no 1 92 18
longer 1 92 18
afraid. 1 92 18

When 0 92 19
the 0 92 19
story 0 92 19
initially 0 92 19
broke, 0 92 19
Franken 0 92 19
rushed 0 92 19
to 0 92 19
issue 0 92 19
an 0 92 19
apology… 0 92 19

“I 0 92 20
certainly 0 92 20
don’t 0 92 20
remember 0 92 20
the 0 92 20
rehearsal 0 92 20
for 0 92 20
the 0 92 20
skit 0 92 20
in 0 92 20
the 0 92 20
same 0 92 20
way, 0 92 20
but 0 92 20
I 0 92 20
send 0 92 20
my 0 92 20
sincerest 0 92 20
apologies 0 92 20
to 0 92 20
Leeann,” 0 92 20
said 0 92 20
Franken. 0 92 20

“As 0 92 21
to 0 92 21
the 0 92 21
photo, 0 92 21
it 0 92 21
was 0 92 21
clearly 0 92 21
intended 0 92 21
to 0 92 21
be 0 92 21
funny 0 92 21
but 0 92 21
wasn’t. 0 92 21

I 0 92 22
shouldn’t 0 92 22
have 0 92 22
done 0 92 22
it.” 0 92 22

Needless 0 92 23
to 0 92 23
say, 0 92 23
many 0 92 23
were 0 92 23
completely 1 92 23
unsatisfied 1 92 23
with 0 92 23
Franken’s 0 92 23
very 1 92 23
weak 1 92 23
statement. 1 92 23

In 0 92 24
fact, 0 92 24
some 0 92 24
members 0 92 24
of 0 92 24
his 0 92 24
own 0 92 24
party 0 92 24
said 0 92 24
that 0 92 24
his 0 92 24
apology 0 92 24
was 0 92 24
entirely 1 92 24
insufficient 1 92 24
and 0 92 24
are 0 92 24
calling 0 92 24
for 0 92 24
Franken 0 92 24
to 0 92 24
be 0 92 24
held 0 92 24
accountable 0 92 24
for 0 92 24
his 0 92 24
actions… 0 92 24

Guy 0 92 25
Cecil, 0 92 25
the 0 92 25
former 0 92 25
head 0 92 25
of 0 92 25
the 0 92 25
Democratic 0 92 25
Senatorial 0 92 25
Campaign 0 92 25
Committee 0 92 25
and 0 92 25
now 0 92 25
the 0 92 25
boss 0 92 25
of 0 92 25
a 0 92 25
leading 0 92 25
Democratic 0 92 25
super 0 92 25
PAC, 0 92 25
voiced 0 92 25
his 0 92 25
frustration 0 92 25
with 0 92 25
the 0 92 25
inadequacy 0 92 25
of 0 92 25
Franken’s 0 92 25
apology 0 92 25
on 0 92 25
Twitter. 0 92 25

“That 0 92 26
was 0 92 26
not 0 92 26
an 0 92 26
apology 0 92 26
and 0 92 26
was 0 92 26
an 0 92 26
insufficient 0 92 26
response 0 92 26
to 0 92 26
serious 0 92 26
allegations,” 0 92 26
Cecil 0 92 26
tweeted. 0 92 26

“Al 1 92 27
Franken 1 92 27
must 1 92 27
be 1 92 27
held 1 92 27
accountable 1 92 27
if 1 92 27
our 1 92 27
party 1 92 27
wants 1 92 27
to 1 92 27
live 1 92 27
up 1 92 27
to 1 92 27
our 1 92 27
commitment 1 92 27
to 1 92 27
women 1 92 27
& 1 92 27
girls.” 1 92 27

This 0 92 28
scandal 0 92 28
has 0 92 28
set 0 92 28
off 0 92 28
a 0 92 28
feeding 1 92 28
frenzy 1 92 28
as 0 92 28
Internet 0 92 28
sleuths 0 92 28
search 0 92 28
for 0 92 28
other 0 92 28
incidents 0 92 28
in 0 92 28
which 0 92 28
Franken 0 92 28
has 0 92 28
acted 0 92 28
inappropriately. 0 92 28

And 0 92 29
of 0 92 29
course, 0 92 29
since 0 92 29
we 0 92 29
are 0 92 29
talking 0 92 29
about 0 92 29
Al 0 92 29
Franken, 0 92 29
it 0 92 29
wasn’t 0 92 29
exactly 0 92 29
difficult 0 92 29
to 0 92 29
find 0 92 29
material. 0 92 29

For 0 92 30
example, 0 92 30
a 0 92 30
photo 0 92 30
has 0 92 30
surfaced 0 92 30
of 0 92 30
Franken 0 92 30
grabbing 0 92 30
Joy 0 92 30
Behar 0 92 30
in 0 92 30
a 0 92 30
very 1 92 30
creepy 1 92 30
manner. 1 92 30

The 0 92 31
following 0 92 31
comes 0 92 31
from 0 92 31
Breitbart… 0 92 31

Amid 0 92 32
the 0 92 32
emergence 0 92 32
of 0 92 32
a 0 92 32
2006 0 92 32
photo 0 92 32
of 0 92 32
Al 0 92 32
Franken 0 92 32
groping 0 92 32
journalist 0 92 32
and 0 92 32
talk 0 92 32
radio 0 92 32
anchor 0 92 32
Leeann 0 92 32
Tweeden, 0 92 32
a 0 92 32
photo 0 92 32
of 0 92 32
the 0 92 32
embattled 0 92 32
Minnesota 0 92 32
Senator 0 92 32
appearing 0 92 32
to 0 92 32
grab 0 92 32
comedian 0 92 32
Joy 0 92 32
Behar’s 0 92 32
breast 0 92 32
has 0 92 32
also 0 92 32
resurfaced. 0 92 32

Franken 0 92 33
was 0 92 33
a 0 92 33
comedian 0 92 33
before 0 92 33
he 0 92 33
ever 0 92 33
entered 0 92 33
the 0 92 33
world 0 92 33
of 0 92 33
politics, 0 92 33
and 0 92 33
we 0 92 33
understand 0 92 33
that. 0 92 33

But 0 92 34
just 0 92 34
because 0 92 34
he 0 92 34
was 0 92 34
a 0 92 34
comedian 0 92 34
does 0 92 34
not 0 92 34
mean 0 92 34
that 0 92 34
he 0 92 34
gets 0 92 34
to 0 92 34
play 0 92 34
by 0 92 34
a 0 92 34
different 0 92 34
set 0 92 34
of 0 92 34
rules. 0 92 34

There 0 92 35
appears 0 92 35
to 0 92 35
be 0 92 35
an 0 92 35
ongoing 0 92 35
pattern 0 92 35
of 0 92 35
behavior, 0 92 35
and 0 92 35
Fox 0 92 35
News 0 92 35
has 0 92 35
documented 0 92 35
some 0 92 35
of 0 92 35
the 0 92 35
other 0 92 35
incidents 0 92 35
that 0 92 35
have 0 92 35
come 0 92 35
up 0 92 35
in 0 92 35
the 0 92 35
past… 0 92 35

Franken, 0 92 36
then 0 92 36
a 0 92 36
comedian, 0 92 36
was 0 92 36
quoted 0 92 36
in 0 92 36
a 0 92 36
1995 0 92 36
New 0 92 36
York 0 92 36
Magazine 0 92 36
article 0 92 36
discussing 0 92 36
a 0 92 36
skit 0 92 36
for 0 92 36
“Saturday 0 92 36
Night 0 92 36
Live” 0 92 36
that 0 92 36
involved 0 92 36
drugging 1 92 36
and 1 92 36
raping 1 92 36
CBS 1 92 36
reporter 1 92 36
Lesley 1 92 36
Stahl. 1 92 36

Franken, 0 92 37
at 0 92 37
the 0 92 37
time 0 92 37
a 0 92 37
writer 0 92 37
for 0 92 37
“SNL,” 0 92 37
suggested 0 92 37
one 0 92 37
skit 0 92 37
should 0 92 37
play 0 92 37
out 0 92 37
with 0 92 37
“60 0 92 37
Minutes” 0 92 37
commentator 0 92 37
Andy 0 92 37
Rooney 0 92 37
finding 0 92 37
an 0 92 37
empty 0 92 37
pill 0 92 37
bottle 0 92 37
on 0 92 37
his 0 92 37
desk. 0 92 37

“’I 0 92 38
give 0 92 38
the 0 92 38
pills 0 92 38
to 0 92 38
Lesley 0 92 38
Stahl. 0 92 38

Then 0 92 39
when 0 92 39
Lesley 0 92 39
is 0 92 39
passed 0 92 39
out, 0 92 39
I 1 92 39
take 1 92 39
her 1 92 39
to 1 92 39
the 1 92 39
closet 1 92 39
and 1 92 39
rape 1 92 39
her.’ 1 92 39
Or 0 92 39
‘That’s 0 92 39
why 0 92 39
you 0 92 39
never 0 92 39
see 0 92 39

until 0 92 39
February.’ 0 92 39
Or, 0 92 39
‘When 0 92 39

out. 0 92 39

I 0 92 40

her 0 92 40
in 0 92 40
various 0 92 40
positions 0 92 40
and 0 92 40
take 0 92 40
pictures 0 92 40
of 0 92 40
her,’” 0 92 40
Franken 0 92 40
was 0 92 40
quoted 0 92 40
saying. 0 92 40

The 0 92 41
article, 0 92 41
along 0 92 41
with 0 92 41
a 0 92 41
2000 0 92 41
Playboy 0 92 41
column 0 92 41
in 0 92 41
which 0 92 41
Franken 0 92 41
talked 0 92 41
about 0 92 41
fantasizing 1 92 41
a 1 92 41
machine 1 92 41
would 1 92 41
perform 1 92 41
oral 1 92 41
sex 1 92 41
on 1 92 41
him, 1 92 41
was 0 92 41
used 0 92 41
to 0 92 41
attack 0 92 41

2008 0 92 41
Senate 0 92 41
campaign 0 92 41
in 0 92 41
Minnesota. 0 92 41

As 1 92 42
much 1 92 42
as 1 92 42
we 1 92 42
may 1 92 42
be 1 92 42
appalled 1 92 42
by 1 92 42
some 1 92 42
of 1 92 42
the 1 92 42
things 1 92 42
that 1 92 42
Al 1 92 42
Franken 1 92 42
has 1 92 42
done, 1 92 42
the 1 92 42
truth 1 92 42
is 1 92 42
that 1 92 42
there 1 92 42
are 1 92 42
far 1 92 42
worse 1 92 42
offenders 1 92 42
in 1 92 42
Washington. 1 92 42

Let’s 0 92 43
talk 0 92 43
about 0 92 43
Bill 0 92 43
Clinton 0 92 43
for 0 92 43
a 0 92 43
moment. 0 92 43

Democrats 0 92 44
have 0 92 44
been 0 92 44
covering 0 92 44

my 0 92 44
hope 0 92 44
is 0 92 44
that 0 92 44
now 0 92 44
this 0 92 44

their 1 92 45
allegations 1 92 45
are 1 92 45
true 1 92 45
Clinton 1 92 45

In 0 92 46
my 0 92 46
article 0 92 46
yesterday, 0 92 46
I 0 92 46
discussed 0 92 46
how 0 92 46
one 0 92 46
Secret 0 92 46
Service 0 92 46
agent 0 92 46
is 0 92 46
charging 0 92 46
former 0 92 46
Vice-President 0 92 46
Joe 0 92 46
Biden 0 92 46
of 0 92 46
engaging 0 92 46
in 0 92 46
“Weinstein-level” 1 92 46
behavior, 1 92 46
and 0 92 46
I 0 92 46
also 0 92 46
talked 0 92 46
about 0 92 46
how 0 92 46
15 0 92 46
million 0 92 46
dollars 0 92 46
in 0 92 46
settlements 0 92 46
have 0 92 46
been 0 92 46
secretly 0 92 46
paid 0 92 46
out 0 92 46
to 0 92 46
victims 0 92 46
of 0 92 46
sexual 0 92 46
harassment 0 92 46
in 0 92 46
the 0 92 46
House 0 92 46
of 0 92 46
Representatives 0 92 46
in 0 92 46
recent 0 92 46
years. 0 92 46

There 1 92 47
is 1 92 47
a 1 92 47
culture 1 92 47
of 1 92 47
corruption 1 92 47
in 1 92 47
Washington 1 92 47
D.C., 1 92 47
and 1 92 47
we 1 92 47
desperately 1 92 47
need 1 92 47
to 1 92 47
drain 1 92 47
the 1 92 47
swamp. 1 92 47

If 1 92 48
you 1 92 48
agree, 1 92 48
I 1 92 48
hope 1 92 48
that 1 92 48
you 1 92 48
will 1 92 48
support 1 92 48
my 1 92 48
campaign 1 92 48
and 1 92 48
the 1 92 48
campaigns 1 92 48
of 1 92 48
other 1 92 48
anti-establishment 1 92 48
candidates 1 92 48
that 1 92 48
want 1 92 48
to 1 92 48
clean 1 92 48
up 1 92 48
the 1 92 48
halls 1 92 48
of 1 92 48
Congress. 1 92 48

It 0 92 49
is 0 92 49
time 0 92 49
to 0 92 49
take 0 92 49
our 0 92 49
government 0 92 49
back 0 92 49
because 0 92 49
at 0 92 49
this 0 92 49
point 0 92 49
it 0 92 49
has 0 92 49
become 0 92 49
an 0 92 49
absolutely 1 92 49
disgusting 1 92 49
cesspool 1 92 49
of 1 92 49
filth 1 92 49
and 1 92 49
corruption. 1 92 49
