Being 0
the 0
paragon 0
of 0
political-correctness 0

queen 0

opportunism, 0
Hillary 0
Clinton 0
sat 0
down 0
with 0
Recode’s 0
Kara 0
Swisher 0
this 0
weekend 0
to 0
answer 0
questions 0
about 0
just 1
how 1
evil 1
and 1
awful 1
conservative 0
opponents 0
have 0
been 0
in 0
the 0
last 0
few 0
months. 0

The 0
conversation 0
began 0
normally, 0
with 0
Clinton 0
hypocritically 1
toeing 1
the 0
progressive 0
line 0
of 0
identity 0
politics 0
by 0
explaining 0
how 0
each 0
of 0
the 0
groups 0
are 0
different 0
but 0
can 0
be 0
managed 0
by 0
the 0
same 0
liberal 0
movement: 0

“What’s 0
often 0
called 0
political 0
correctness 0
is 0
politeness,” 0
Clinton 0
said. 0

“It’s 0
not 0
being 0
rude 0
and 0
insulting 0
to 0
people. 0

It’s 0
respecting 0
the 0
diversity 0
that 0
we 0
have 0
in 0
our 0
society,” 0
she 0
said. 0

“The 0
Democratic 0
Party 0
is 0
a 0
much 0
more 0
diverse 0
political 0
party, 0
attracting 0
people 0
who 0
are 0
African-American, 0
Latino, 0
LGBT, 0
whatever 0
the 0
reason 0
why 0
people 0
feel 0
more 0
comfortable 0
where 0
they 0
are 0
taken 0
in, 0
where 0
they 0
are 0
included 0
as 0
part 0
of 0
a 0
political 0
movement 0
or 0
party.” 0
“And 0
I 0
don’t 0
think 0
it’s 0
politically 0
correct 0
to 0
say 0
we 0
value 0
that. 0

And 0
I 0
don’t 0
want 0
to 0
go 0
around 0
insulting 0
people. 0

I 0
don’t 0
want 0
to 0
paint 0
with 0
a 0
broad 0
brush 0
every 0
immigrant 0
is 0
this, 0
every 0
African-American 0
is 0
that, 0
every, 0
you 0
know, 0
other 0
person 0
with 0
different 0
religious 0
beliefs 0
or 0
whatever 0
– 0
that’s 1
childish.” 1

Childish, 1
indeed. 1

Insulting, 1
indeed. 1

Just 0
30 0
seconds 0
later, 0
as 0
Swisher 0
asked: 0

“what 0
do 0
you 0
think 0
of 0
Cory 0
Booker… 0
saying 0
‘kick 1
them 1
in 1
the 1
shins,’ 1
essentially…” 0
incorrectly 0
recalling 0
Eric 0
Holder’s 0
recent 0
comments. 0

Which 0
Clinton 0
quickly 0
corrected: 0

“Well 0
that 0
was 0
Eric 0
Holder…” 0

Adding, 0
rather 1
extraordinarily, 1

“Yeah, 0
I 0
know 0
they 0
all 0
look 0
alike,” 0
Clinton 0
joked, 0
triggering 0
howls 0
of 0
laughter 0
from 0
the 0
apparently 0
mind-numbed 0
audience. 0

Sorry 1
Hillary, 1
we 1
don’t 1
think 1
they 1
look 1
anything 1
alike. 1

Or 1
did 1
you 1
mean 1
all 1
black 1
people? 1

Finally, 0
we 0
have 0
one 0
question 0
– 0
what 0
would 0
have 0
happened 0
if 0
Trump 0
said 0
it? 0

As 1
The 1
American 1
Mirror’s 1
Kyle 1
Olsen 1
concludes 1
so 1
eloquently, 1
Hillary 1
Clinton 1
appears 1
to 1
benefit 1
from 1
her 1
progressive 1
privilege 1
– 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
only 1
thing 1
that 1
protects 1
her 1
from 1
getting 1
the 1
‘Roseanne 1
treatment’, 1
and 1
not 1
being 1
dismissed 1
in 1
disgrace. 1
