questions 0 330 2
about 0 330 2
just 1 330 2

evil 1 330 2
and 1 330 2

The 0 330 3
conversation 0 330 3
began 0 330 3
normally, 0 330 3
with 0 330 3
Clinton 0 330 3
hypocritically 1 330 3
toeing 1 330 3
the 0 330 3
progressive 0 330 3
line 0 330 3
of 0 330 3
identity 0 330 3
politics 0 330 3
by 0 330 3
explaining 0 330 3
how 0 330 3
each 0 330 3
of 0 330 3
the 0 330 3
groups 0 330 3
are 0 330 3
different 0 330 3
but 0 330 3
can 0 330 3
be 0 330 3
managed 0 330 3
by 0 330 3
the 0 330 3
same 0 330 3
liberal 0 330 3
movement: 0 330 3

“What’s 0 330 4
often 0 330 4
called 0 330 4
political 0 330 4
correctness 0 330 4
is 0 330 4
politeness,” 0 330 4
Clinton 0 330 4
said. 0 330 4

“It’s 0 330 5
not 0 330 5
being 0 330 5
rude 0 330 5
and 0 330 5
insulting 0 330 5
to 0 330 5
people. 0 330 5

It’s 0 330 6
respecting 0 330 6
the 0 330 6
diversity 0 330 6
that 0 330 6
we 0 330 6
have 0 330 6
in 0 330 6
our 0 330 6
society,” 0 330 6
she 0 330 6
said. 0 330 6

“The 0 330 7
Democratic 0 330 7
Party 0 330 7
is 0 330 7
a 0 330 7
much 0 330 7
more 0 330 7
diverse 0 330 7
political 0 330 7
party, 0 330 7
attracting 0 330 7
people 0 330 7
who 0 330 7
are 0 330 7
African-American, 0 330 7
Latino, 0 330 7
LGBT, 0 330 7
whatever 0 330 7
the 0 330 7
reason 0 330 7
why 0 330 7
people 0 330 7
feel 0 330 7
more 0 330 7
comfortable 0 330 7
where 0 330 7
they 0 330 7
are 0 330 7
taken 0 330 7
in, 0 330 7
where 0 330 7
they 0 330 7
are 0 330 7
included 0 330 7
as 0 330 7
part 0 330 7
of 0 330 7
a 0 330 7
political 0 330 7
movement 0 330 7
or 0 330 7
party.” 0 330 7
“And 0 330 7
I 0 330 7
don’t 0 330 7
think 0 330 7
it’s 0 330 7
politically 0 330 7
correct 0 330 7
to 0 330 7
say 0 330 7
we 0 330 7
value 0 330 7
that. 0 330 7

And 0 330 8
I 0 330 8
don’t 0 330 8
want 0 330 8
to 0 330 8
go 0 330 8
around 0 330 8
insulting 0 330 8
people. 0 330 8

I 0 330 9
don’t 0 330 9
want 0 330 9
to 0 330 9
paint 0 330 9
with 0 330 9
a 0 330 9
broad 0 330 9
brush 0 330 9
every 0 330 9
immigrant 0 330 9
is 0 330 9
this, 0 330 9
every 0 330 9
African-American 0 330 9
is 0 330 9
that, 0 330 9
every, 0 330 9
you 0 330 9
know, 0 330 9
other 0 330 9
person 0 330 9
with 0 330 9
different 0 330 9
religious 0 330 9
beliefs 0 330 9
or 0 330 9
whatever 0 330 9
– 0 330 9
that’s 1 330 9
childish.” 1 330 9

Childish, 1 330 10
indeed. 1 330 10

Insulting, 1 330 11
indeed. 1 330 11

Just 0 330 12
30 0 330 12
seconds 0 330 12
later, 0 330 12
as 0 330 12
Swisher 0 330 12
asked: 0 330 12

“what 0 330 13
do 0 330 13
you 0 330 13
think 0 330 13
of 0 330 13
Cory 0 330 13
Booker… 0 330 13
saying 0 330 13
‘kick 1 330 13
them 1 330 13
in 1 330 13
the 1 330 13
shins,’ 1 330 13
essentially…” 0 330 13
incorrectly 0 330 13
recalling 0 330 13
Eric 0 330 13
Holder’s 0 330 13
recent 0 330 13
comments. 0 330 13

Which 0 330 14
Clinton 0 330 14
quickly 0 330 14
corrected: 0 330 14

“Well 0 330 15
that 0 330 15
was 0 330 15
Eric 0 330 15
Holder…” 0 330 15

Adding, 0 330 16
rather 1 330 16
extraordinarily, 1 330 16

“Yeah, 0 330 17
I 0 330 17
know 0 330 17
they 0 330 17
all 0 330 17
look 0 330 17
alike,” 0 330 17
Clinton 0 330 17
joked, 0 330 17
triggering 0 330 17
howls 0 330 17
of 0 330 17
laughter 0 330 17
from 0 330 17
the 0 330 17
apparently 0 330 17
mind-numbed 0 330 17
audience. 0 330 17

Sorry 1 330 18
Hillary, 1 330 18
we 1 330 18
don’t 1 330 18
think 1 330 18
they 1 330 18
look 1 330 18
anything 1 330 18
alike. 1 330 18

Or 1 330 19
did 1 330 19
you 1 330 19
mean 1 330 19
all 1 330 19
black 1 330 19
people? 1 330 19

Finally, 0 330 20
we 0 330 20
have 0 330 20
one 0 330 20
question 0 330 20
– 0 330 20
what 0 330 20
would 0 330 20
have 0 330 20
happened 0 330 20
if 0 330 20
Trump 0 330 20
said 0 330 20
it? 0 330 20

As 1 330 21
The 1 330 21
American 1 330 21
Mirror’s 1 330 21
Kyle 1 330 21
Olsen 1 330 21
concludes 1 330 21
so 1 330 21
eloquently, 1 330 21
Hillary 1 330 21
Clinton 1 330 21
appears 1 330 21
to 1 330 21
benefit 1 330 21
from 1 330 21
her 1 330 21
progressive 1 330 21
privilege 1 330 21
– 1 330 21
it 1 330 21
is 1 330 21
the 1 330 21
only 1 330 21
thing 1 330 21
that 1 330 21
protects 1 330 21
her 1 330 21
from 1 330 21
getting 1 330 21
the 1 330 21
‘Roseanne 1 330 21
treatment’, 1 330 21
and 1 330 21
not 1 330 21
being 1 330 21
dismissed 1 330 21
in 1 330 21
disgrace. 1 330 21
