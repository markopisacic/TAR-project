He 0
also 0
sought 0
to 0
fight 0
back 0
against 0
criticism 0
in 0
his 1
failure 1
to 1
perform 1

“Finally, 0
I 0

welcomed 0

as 0
public 0
servants, 0
our 0
judges 0
should 0
also,” 0
Gallegos 0
said 0
in 0
the 0

“However, 0
I 0
ask 0
that 0
you 0
be 0
civil 0
and 0
respectful 0
in 0
your 0
criticisms 0
as 0
that 0
is 0
more 0
constructive. 0

Cussing 1
and 1
threatening 1
the 0
people 0
involved 0
will 0
not 0
accomplish 0
justice 0
and 0
serves 0
no 0
useful 0
purpose. 0

Remember, 0
you 0
do 0
not 0
have 0
all 0
the 0
facts. 0

That 0
will 0
develop 0
as 0
the 0
cases 0
progress." 0

Yeah, 0
well, 0
that's 1
about 1
as 1
trustworthy 1
as 1
the 1
FBI 1
in 1
this 1
matter. 1

This 0
latest 0
move, 0
while 0
welcome, 0
may 0
only 0
be 0
a 0
response 0
to 0
President 0
Donald 0
Trump's 0
vow 0
to 0
"get 0
involved." 0

However, 1
I 1
ask, 1
why 1
were 1
you 1
not 1
involved 1
in 1
the 1
first 1
place, 1
Mr. 1
President? 1

According 1
to 1
the 1
Constitution, 1
you, 1
and 1
you 1
alone, 1
are 1
the 1
sole 1
head 1
of 1
the 1
executive 1
branch, 1
and 1
as 1
such 1
you 1
are 1
where 1
the 1
buck 1
stop 1
in 1
making 1
sure 1
the 1
laws 1
are 1
faithfully 1
executed. 1

So, 0
if 0
Trump 0
is 0
going 0
to 0
fire 0
Sessions, 0
perhaps 1
he 1
should 1
stop 1
talking 1
about 1
it 1
and 1
get 1
to 1
it 1
and 1
actually 1
put 1
someone 1
in 1
the 1
Justice 1
Department 1
as 1
attorney 1
general 1
who 1
will 1
do 1
the 1
job 1
faithfully, 1
and 1
by 1
that, 1
I 1
don't 1
mean 1
Trey 1
Gowdy. 1

I 1
mean 1
someone 1
who 1
is 1
serious 1
about 1
justice, 1
not 1
political 1
grandstanding 1
or 1
covering 1
up 1
criminal 1
activity. 1

Until 0
then, 0
I'll 0
consider 0
this 0
the 0
means 0
the 0
FBI 0
will 0
use 0
to 0
engage 0
in 0
the 0
further 0
coverup 0
of 0
what 0
really 0
took 0
place 0
at 0
that 0
compound 0
beyond 0
the 0
bulldozing 0
of 0
a 0
crime 0
scene, 0
and 0
possibly, 0
their 0
own 0
complicity. 0
