It’s 0 320 1
noteworthy 0 320 1
that 0 320 1
AP 0 320 1
would 0 320 1
carry 0 320 1
this 0 320 1

certainly, 0 320 1
neither 0 320 1

solicitous 0 320 1

those 0 320 1
whom 0 320 1
they 0 320 1
smear 1 320 1
as 0 320 1
“anti-Muslim” 1 320 1
to 0 320 1
allow 0 320 1

the 0 320 2
imam 0 320 2

engaging 1 320 2
in 1 320 2
some 1 320 2
“war 1 320 2

deceit” 1 320 2
action. 1 320 2

His 0 320 3
son 0 320 3
was 0 320 3
on 0 320 3
the 0 320 3

it’s 1 320 5
