Russiagate 0
is 0
an 0
orchestration. 0

It 0
is 0
the 0
response 0
of 0
the 0
military/security 0
complex 0
to 0
Donald 0
Trump’s 0
presidential 0
campaign 0
statement 0
that 0
he 0
intended 0
to 0
normalize 0
relations 0
with 0
Russia. 0

Trump 0
recognized 0
that 0
the 0
extreme 0
Russiaphobia, 0
which 0
the 1
hegemonic 1
neoconservatives 1
had 1
whipped 1
up 1
since 0
Vladimir 0
Putin’s 0
statement 0
at 0
the 0
Munich 0
Security 0
Conference 0
in 0
2007 0
that 0
Russia 0
was 0
a 0
sovereign 0
country 0
and 0
intended 0
to 0
act 0
like 0
one, 0
was 1
a 1
threat 1
to 1
life 1
on 1
earth. 1

The 0
neoconservatives, 0
who 0
have 0
controlled 0
US 0
foreign 0
policy 0
since 0
the 0
Clinton 0
regime, 0
are 0
unwilling 0
to 0
accept 0
limitations 0
by 0
any 0
other 0
country 0
on 0
Washington’s 0
ability 0
to 0
act 0
unilaterally. 0

When 0
Putin 0
blocked 0
the 0
Obama 0
regime’s 0
invasion 0
of 0
Syria 0
and 0
bombing 0
of 0
Iran, 0
the 0
neoconservatives 0
paid 0
Putin 0
back 0
by 0
using 0
NGOs 0
and 0
Ukranian 0
politicians 0
financed 0
by 0
Washington 0
to 0
overthrow 0
the 1
democratically 1
elected 1
government 1
of 1
Ukraine 1
and 0
to 0
put 0
in 0
office 0
a 0
government 0
hostile 0
to 0
Russia. 0

The 0
intent 0
was 0
to 0
use 0
Ukraine, 0
a 0
Russian 0
province 0
for 0
more 0
than 0
three 0
centuries, 0
to 0
create 0
problems 0
for 0
Russia 0
that 0
would 0
absorb 0
Russia’s 0
attention 0
and 0
return 1
a 1
free 1
hand 1
to 0
Washington 0
and 0
Israel 0
in 0
the 0
Middle 0
East 0
and 0
also 0
to 0
evict 0
Russia 0
from 0
its 0
Black 0
Sea 0
naval 0
base 0
in 0
Crimea. 0

When 1
Crimeans 1
voted 1
to 1
reunite 1
with 1
Russia, 1
Washington 1
misrepresented 1
the 1
democratic 1
result 1
of 1
self-determination 1
as 1
a 1
“Russian 1
invasion 1
and 1
annexation 1
of 1
Crimea.” 1
Such 1
an 1
extraordinary 1
misrepresentation 1
destroyed 1
any 1
remaining 1
confidence 1
the 1
Russian 1
government 1
might 1
have 1
had 1
in 1
Washington’s 1
veracity. 1

From 0
here 0
relations 0
between 0
the 0
two 0
nuclear 0
powers 0
deteriorated 0
rapidly. 0

As 1
I 1
and 1
Stephen 1
Cohen 1
have 1
emphasized, 1
the 1
danger 1
of 1
nuclear 1
war 1
is 1
today 1
far 1
higher 1
than 1
ever 1
during 1
the 1
long 1
Cold 1
War 1
as 1
there 1
is 1
today 1
no 1
trust 1
whatsoever 1
between 1
the 1
two 1
governments. 1

Donald 0
Trump 0
is 1
totally 1
correct 1
that 0
nuclear 0
war 0
would 0
be 0
a 0
terminable 0
event 0
and 0
that 0
nothing 1
is 1
more 1
important 1
than 0
restoring 0
a 0
cooperative 0
and 0
mutually 0
respectful 0
relationship 0
between 0
the 0
US 0
and 0
Russia. 0

The 0
problem 0
is 0
that 0
the 0
military/security 0
complex 0
sees 0
it 0
differently. 0

After 0
70 0
years 0
of 0
entrenchment 0
the 0
military/security 0
complex 0
is 0
an 0
independent 0
political 0
force. 0

President 0
Eisenhower 0
warned 0
the 0
American 0
people 0
about 0
this 0
likely 0
outcome 0
in 0
1961 0
to 0
no 0
avail. 0

From 0
the 0
standpoint 0
of 0
the 0
military/security 0
complex, 0
the 0
problem 0
of 0
normalizing 0
relations 0
with 0
Russia 0
is 0
that 0
it 0
downgrades 0
the 0
“Russian 0
threat” 0
that 0
is 0
so 0
essential 0
to 0
the 0
$1,000 0
billion 0
annual 0
budget 0
of 0
the 0
military/security 0
complex 0
and 0
the 0
power 0
that 0
such 0
a 0
massive 1
budget 1
conveys. 0

Only 0
16 0

out 0
of 0

The 0

is 0
large 0

to 0
be 0
a 0
member 0
of 0
the 0

to 0

its 0
own 0

and 0

Obama’s 0
CIA 0
director, 0
John 0
Brennan, 0
quickly 0
organized 0
the 0

against 0

an 0
alleged 0
collusion 0
between 0
Donald 0

and 0
Vladimir 0

to 0
steal 0
the 0

Based 0
on 0
deception 0
of 0
the 0
FISA 0
Court, 0
warrants 0
were 0
illegally 0
obtained 0
that 0
became 0
the 0

for 0

prosecutor 0
to 0
construct 0
by 0
whatever 0
means 0
possible 0
a 0
case 0
against 0
President 0
Trump. 0

After 0
two 0
years 0
the 0
only 0
evidence 0
we 0
have 0
of 0
Russiagate 0
is 0
that 0
it 1
is 1
a 1
conspiracy 1
against 1
President 1
Trump 1
and 1
the 1
American 1
people. 1

Indeed, 0
Mueller, 0
fully 0
aware 0
that 0
there 0
was 0
no 0
Trump-Putin 0
conspiracy, 0
has 0
not 0
bothered 0
to 0
look 0
for 0
any 0
evidence 0
as 0
there 0
can 0
be 0
no 0
evidence 0
of 0
something 0
that 0
did 0
not 0
happen. 0

He 0
pulled 0
out 0
of 0
a 0
hat 0
some 0
phony 0
and 0
meaningless 0
indictments 0
of 0
some 0
Russians 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
make 0
it 0
look 0
like 0
there 0
was 0
a 0
conspiracy 0
without 0
having 0
to 0
prove 0
it, 0
but 0
his 0
main 0
focus 0
has 0
been 0
on 0
framing 0
Paul 0
Manafort. 0

Mueller’s 0
investigation 0
of 0
Manafort 0
has 0
nothing 0
to 0
do 0
with 0
the 0
Russiagate 0
story 0
line. 0

Manafort’s 0
alleged 0
crimes 0
are 0
far 0
outside 0
Mueller’s 0
mandate 0
and 0
took 0
place, 0
if 0
they 0
did, 0
years 0
before 0
the 0
alleged 0
events 0
of 0
Russiagate. 0

Manafort’s 0
conviction 0
by 0
a 0
jury 0
on 0
8 0
of 0
the 0
18 0
counts 0
is 0
being 0
misrepresented 0
by 0
the 0
Trump-hating 0
presstitutes 0
as 0
vindication 0
of 0
the 0
Russiagate 0
investigation 0
and 0
as 0
“A 0
dark 0
day 0
for 0
Trump,” 0
with 0
the 0
presstitutes 0
suggesting 0
a 0
Watergate 0
parallel 0
that 0
will 0
force 0
Trump 0
from 0
office. 0

Manafort 0
was 0
found 0
guilty 0
not 0
of 0
Russiagate, 0
but 0
of 0
income 0
tax 0
evasion 0
and 0
misrepresenting 0
his 0
financial 0
position 0
on 0
a 0
loan 0
application. 0

We 0
do 0
not 0
know 0
if 0
Manafort 0
is 0
guilty 0
or 0
is 0
simply 0
a 0
victim 0
of 0
Mueller’s 0
frameup 0
and 0
an 1
incompetent 1
jury. 1

American 0
juries 0
are 0
notoriously 0
incompetent, 0
which 0
is 0
why 0
97% 0
of 0
felony 0
indictments 0
are 0
settled 0
with 0
a 0
plea 0
bargain. 0

Even 0
the 0
innocent 0
had 0
rather 0
work 0
out 0
a 0
plea 0
arrangement 0
and 0
admit 0
to 0
something 0
that 0
they 0
did 0
not 0
do 0
than 0
to 0
face 0
an 1
insouciant 1
American 1
jury. 1

Remember 0
the 0
jury 0
that 0
condemned 0
the 0
survivors 0
of 0
the 0
FBI’s 0
massacre 0
of 0
the 0
Branch 0
Davidians 0
in 0
Waco, 0
Texas, 0
to 0
be 0
locked 0
away 0
for 0
many 0
years 0
so 0
that 0
they 0
could 0
not 0
talk 0
and 0
tell 0
of 0
the 0
mass 0
murder 0
inflicted 0
on 0
a 0
religious 0
group 0
by 0
the 0
FBI. 0

It 0
is 0
unclear 0
how 0
much 0
of 0
a 0
crime 0
it 0
can 0
be 0
to 0
misrepresent 0
your 0
financial 0
position 0
on 0
a 0
loan 0
application 0
when 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
causes 0
of 0
the 0
mortgage-backed 0
derivative 0
crisis 0
was 0
the 0
misrepresentation 0
of 0
mortgage 0
applicants 0
on 0
the 0
loan 0
documents 0
by 0
the 0
companies 0
issuing 0
the 0
mortgages. 0

Instead 0
of 0
prosecution, 0
Washington 0
relied 0
on 0
the 0
Federal 0
Reserve 0
to 0
bail 0
out 0
the 0
banks 0
holding 0
the 0
misrepresented 0
loans. 0

Income 0
tax 0
invasion 0
is 0
the 0
purview 0
of 0
the 0
IRS, 0
not 0
of 0
a 0
special 0
prosecutor 0
who 0
is 0
supposed 0
to 0
be 0
looking 0
for 0
evidence 0
of 0
a 0
Trump-Putin 0

So, 1
why 1
did 1
Mueller 1
focus 1
on 1
Manafort? 1

Let 1
Harvard 1
Law 1
Professor 1
Alan 1
Dershowitz 1
tell 1
you: 1

“All 0
the 0
Special 0
Counsel 0
needs, 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
charge 0
a 0
subject 0
of 0
an 0
investigation 0
with 0
lying 0
to 0
a 0
prosecutor, 0
is 0
a 0
single 0
witnesses 0
willing 0
to 0
contradict 0
the 0
subject. 0

“The 1
witness 1
may 1
not 1
only 1
be 1
“singing,” 1
he 1
may 1
also 1
be 1
“composing” 1
— 0
that 0
is, 0
making 0
up 0
or 0
embellishing 0
a 0
story 0
because 0
he 0
knows 0
that 0
the 0
better 0
his 0
story, 0
the 0
better 0
the 0
deal. 0

“Under 0
federal 0
law, 0
the 0
testimony 0
of 0
such 0
a 0
“flipped 1
witness” 1
need 0
not 0
be 0
corroborated 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
secure 0
a 0
conviction. 0

“Even 0
one 0
question 0
that 0
results 0
in 0
an 0
answer 0
that 0
is 0
contradicted 0
by 0
one 0
witness 0
would 0
be 0
enough 0
to 0
spring 1
the 1
perjury 1
trap.” 1

President 0
Trump 0
has 0
made 0
various 0
statements 0
disputing 0
the 0
orchestrated 0
Russiagate 0
accusations 0
that, 0
if 0
Manafort 0
as 0
witness 0
for 0
the 0
Special 0
Prosecutor 0
contradicted, 0
could 0
send 0
the 0
President 0
of 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
to 0
prison 0
for 0
perjury. 0

Knowing 0
this, 0
Mueller, 0
in 0
my 0
opinion 0
a 0
proven 0
corrupt 0
person, 0
decided 0
to 1
put 1
the 1
squeeze 1
on 0
Manafort 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
force 0
Manafort 0
to 0
save 0
himself 0
by 0
giving 0
false 0
testimony 0
against 0
Trump. 0

This 0
tactic 0
is 0
used 0
every 0
day 0
by 0
state, 0
local, 0
and 0
federal 0
prosecutors. 0

Americans 0
who 0
believe 0
the 0
indictments 0
and 0
convictions 0
are 0
unaware 0
that 0
97% 0
of 0
the 0
time 0
the 0
convictions 0
rest 0
on 0
self-incrimination 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
avoid 0
worse 0
punishment. 0

In 0
Manafort’s 0
case 0
it 0
didn’t, 0
or 0
hasn’t, 0
worked. 0

Yet. 0

Manafort 0
is 0
due 0
for 0
a 0
second 0
trial, 0
this 0
time 0
for 0
allegely 0
acting 0
as 0
an 0
unregistered 0
foreign 0
agent 0
for 0
Ukrainian 0
interests 0
and 0
for 0
making 0
false 0
statements 0
not 0
under 0
oath 0
to 0
the 0
US 0
government. 0

Reportedly, 0
Manafort 0
is 0
being 0
held 0
in 0
solitary 0
confinement, 0
a 0
form 0
of 0
torture 0
designed 0
to 0
break 0
a 0
person’s 0
spirit. 0

Like 0
Manafort’s 0
first 0
trial, 0
his 0
second 0
trial 0
has 0
nothing 0
whatsoever 0
to 0
do 0
with 0
Russiagate, 0
but 0
you 0
will 0
never 0
learn 0
that 0
from 0
the 0
presstitute 0
media 0
or 0
from 0
the 0
Democratic 0
Party. 0

Manafort 0
can 0
still 0
be 0
coerced 0
to 0
say 0
something 0
that 0
can 0
be 0
used 0
to 0
drive 0
Trump 0
from 0
office. 0

What 0
about 0
Michael 0
Cohen, 0
a 0
former 0
attorney 0
for 0
Trump? 0

Mueller 0
saw 0
no 0
value 0
in 0
the 0
Cohen 0
case 0
and 0
passed 0
it 0
off 0
to 0
a 0
regular 0
US 0
attorney 0
to 0
prosecute. 0

Therefore, 0
it 0
would 0
appear 0
not 0
to 0
be 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
Russiagate 0
investigation. 0

Cohen 0
avoided 0
a 0
jury 0
and 0
said 0
he 0
was 0
guilty 0
of 0
five 0
counts 0
of 0
personal 0
income 0
tax 0
evasion, 0
one 0
count 0
of 0
making 0
a 0
false 0
statement 0
to 0
a 0
financial 0
institution 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
get 0
a 0
loan, 0
and 0
two 0
counts 0
related 0
to 0
illegal 0
campaign 0
contributions. 0

With 0
regard 0
to 0
the 0
campagin 0
contributions, 0
he 0
contradicted 0
his 0
previous 0
statements. 0

He 0
said 0
that 0
on 0
Trump’s 0
instruction, 0
he 0
paid 0
off 0
two 0
women 0
who 0
were 0
claiming 0
sexual 0
affairs 0
with 0
Trump. 0

The 1
intricacies 1
of 1
American 1
laws 1
relating 1
to 1
politics 1
are 1
often 1
unclear. 1

Apparently, 0
the 0
charge 0
is 0
that 0
Cohen 0
used 0
monies 0
raised 0
for 0
a 0
political 0
campaign 0
to 0
pay 0
off 0
two 0
women, 0
who 0
saw 0
and 0
capitalized 0
on 0
an 0
opportunity 0
to 0
extort 0
Trump 0
for 0
money, 0
and 0
this 0
was 0
an 0
illegal 0
use 0
of 0
the 0
money. 0

Why 1
a 1
lawyer 1
would 1
pay 1
off 1
women, 1
whose 1
stories 1
might 1
or 1
might 1
not 1
be 1
true, 1
in 1
an 1
illegal 1
way 1
when 1
his 1
client 1
is 1
a 1
multi-billionaire 1
doesn’t 1
make 1
much 1
sense. 1

But 1
these 1
are 1
not 1
the 1
kind 1
of 1
questions 1
that 1
the 1
presstitutes 1
are 1
interested 1
in. 1

Nevertheless, 0
Cohen’s 0
plea 0
is 0
associated 0
with 0
a 0
case 0
brought 0
by 0
another 0
prosecutor, 0
not 0
by 0
Special 0
Prosecutor 0
Mueller. 0

I 0
am 0
not 0
sufficiently 0
familiar 0
with 0
US 0
legal 0
procedures 0
to 0
be 0
able 0
to 0
say 0
how 0
this 0
gets 0
brought 0
back 0
into 0
Mueller’s 0
investigation. 0

The 0
facts 0
are 0
this: 0

The 0
US 0
military/security 0
complex 0
will 0
not 0
permit 0
any 0
normalization 0
of 0
relations 0
with 0
Russia. 0

Period. 0

At 0
some 0
point 0
Putin 0
and 0
Lavrov 0
and 0
the 0
idiot 0
Russian 0
Atlanticist 0
Integrationists 0
will 0
have 0
to 0
acknowledge 0
this 0
fact, 0
or 0
Russia 0
will 0
be 0
destroyed. 0

Trump, 0
by 0
declaring 0
normalization 0
of 0
relations 0

President 0
Trump 0
stands 0
up 0
for 0
himself 0
on 0
Twitter 0
— 0
I 0
am 0
surprised 0
that 0
Tritter 0
hasn’t 0
suspended 0
his 0
account 0
— 0
but 0
otherwise 0
seems 0
powerless. 0

Whoever 0
advised 0
Trump 0
to 0
appoint 0
Rosenstein, 0
a 1
person 1
committed 1
to 1
Trump’s 1
destruction, 1
as 0
deputy 0
attorney 0
general, 0
which 0
is 0
the 0
ruling 0
position 0
in 0
view 0
of 0
the 0
weak 0
and 0
stupid 0
AG 0
Sessions 0
who 0
recused 0
himself 0
from 0
the 0
Russiagate 0
investigation, 0
intended 0
Trump’s 0
destruction. 0

A 0
disreputable 0
person 0
committed 0
to 0
Trump’s 0
destruction 0
is 0
appointed 0
by 0
Trump 0
to 0
destroy 0
Trump. 0

How 0
can 0
a 0
person 0
so 0
unclued 0
survive? 0

As 0
I 0
wrote 0
during 0
the 0
presidential 0
campaign, 0
Trump 0
has 0
no 0
idea 0
of 0
Washington 0
and 0
no 0
idea 0
who 0
to 0
appoint 0
who 0
would 0
support 0
him 0
rather 0
than 0
work 0
against 0
him. 0

Consequently, 0
he 0
has 0
a 0
government 0
working 0
against 0
him. 0

Senators 0
John 0
McCain 0
and 0
Lindsey 0
Graham 0
are 0
working 0
to 0
prevent 0
the 0
Republican 0
Party 0
from 0
supporting 0
the 0
party’s 0
president. 0

They 0
could 0
easily 0
succeed. 0

The 1
entirety 1
of 1
the 1
House 1
and 1
Senate 1
of 1
both 1
parties 1
is 1
in 1
thrall 1
to 1
the 1
campaign 1
donations 1
of 1
the 1
military/security 1
complex. 1

What 0
can 0
President 0
Trump 0
do? 0

He 0
could 0
fight, 0
not 0
with 0
words 0
on 0
Twitter, 0
but 0
with 0
the 0
powers 0
of 0
the 0
presidency. 0

There 0
is 0
far 0
more 0
evidence 0
that 0
Russiagate 0
is 0
a 0
conspiracy 0
against 0
the 0
President 0
of 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
than 0
there 0
is 0
evidence 0
that 0
it 0
is 0
a 0
Trump-Putin 0
conspiracy 0
to 0
steal 0
the 0
election 0
from 0
Hillary. 0

If 0
Mueller 0
can 0
indict 0
on 0
the 0
basis 0
of 0
no 0
evidence, 0
Trump 0
can 0
order 0
the 0
Attorney 0
General 0
to 0
indict 0
on 0
the 0
basis 0
of 0
massive 1

The 1
idiot 1
presstitutes’ 1

of 1

might 1
leave 1
them 1
unaware 1
of 1
the 1
conspiracy 1
in 1
which 1
they 1
are 1

but 0
there 0
is 0
no 0
doubt 0
that 0
the 0
American 0

are 0
engaged 0
in 0
the 0
overthrow 0
of 0
American 0
democracy, 0
however 0

It 0

it 0

in 0

Trump 0
is 0
wrong 0
on 0
the 0
environment. 0

Environmental 0
protections 0
put 0

after 0
years 0
of 0

are 1
being 1

by 0

This 0
is 0
not 0
a 0
unique 0
happening 0
of 0
the 0
Trump 0
presidency. 0

It 0
began 0
under 0

Dick 0

the 1
real 1
president 1
during 1
the 1
8 1
years 1
of 1

Trump 0
is 0
wrong 0
on 0
Iran. 0

He 0
is 0
in 0
Israel’s 0
hands, 0
hoping 0
that 0
the 0
power 0
of 0
the 0
Israel 0
Lobby 0
can 0
shield 0
him 0
from 0
the 0
presstitutes 0
and 0
the 0

complex. 0

What 0
Israel 0
is 0
doing 0
by 0
attempting 0
to 0
use 0
US 0
military 0
force 0
against 0
Iran 0
is 0
unifying 0
a 0
new 0
alliance 0
that 0
is 0
too 0
powerful 0
for 0
the 0
Washington/Israeli 0
alliance. 0

Russia, 0
China, 0
Syria, 0
Turkey, 0
Iran, 0
India, 0
and 0
Pakistan 0
are 0
the 0
locations 0
of 0
populations 0
that 1
massively 1
outnumber 1
Washington’s 1
empire. 1

Each 0
of 0
these 0
countries 0
are 0
being 0
united 0
by 0
Washington’s 0
stupid 0
and 0
inexplicable 0
actions 0
against 0
each. 0

Militarily, 0
Israel 0
is 0
of 0
no 0
consequence. 0

Twice 0
the 0
vaunted 0
Israeli 0
Army, 0
capable 0
of 0
nothing 0
but 0
murdering 0
unarmed 0
women 0
and 0
children, 0
were 0
defeated 0
and 0
driven 0
out 0
of 0
southern 0
Lebanon 0
by 0
a 0
few 0
thousand 0
Hezbollah 0
militia. 0

Israel 0
is 0
too 0
cowardly 0
to 0
try 0
it 0
a 0
third 0
time, 0
and 0
is 0
relying 0
on 0
the 0
stupid 0
Americans 0
to 0
do 0
the 0
job 0
for 0
them. 0

The 1
entire 1
world 1
looks 1
at 1
America 1
and 1
Israel, 1
and 0
what 0
does 0
the 0
world 0
see? 0

Two 0
countries, 0
both 0
the 0
result 0
of 0
exterminating 0
the 0
native 0
populations, 0
distrusted 0
and 0
universally 0
hated, 0
both 0
of 0
which 0
survive 0
by 0
purhasing 0
the 0
governments 0
of 0
other 0
countries 0
and 0
by 0
endless 0
lies 0
that 0
describe 0
everyone 0
but 0
themselves 0
and 0
their 0
vassals 0
as 0
evil 0
criminals 0
that 0
must 0
be 0
destroyed. 0

For 0
example, 0
the 0
Gaza 0
Strip, 0
the 0
largest 0
concentration 0
camp 0
ever 0
in 0
the 0
world, 0
is 0
being 0
systematically 0
destroyed 0
along 0
with 0
all 0
life 0
within 0
it 0
by 0
Israel 0
under 1
cover 1
of 1
the 1
obvious 1
and 1
transparanent 1
lie 1
that 0
all 0
within 0
Gaza 0
are 0
terrorists 0
outfitted 0
with 0
bomb 0
belts 0
who 0
are 0
committed 0
to 0
the 0
destruction 0
of 0
Israel. 0

Not 0
only 0
men 0
of 0
fighting 0
age, 0
but 0
also 0
old 0
men, 0
pregnant 0
women, 0
children, 0
all 0
Palestinians 0
are 0
being 0
murdered 0
by 0
the 0
Israeli 0
military. 0

The 0
United 0
States 0
Secretary 0
of 0
State 0
agrees 0
with 0
Israel 0
that 0
all 0
Palestinians 0
must 0
be 0
destroyed, 0
the 1
sooner 1
the 1
better. 1

The 0
Chinese 0
are 0
busy 0
taking 0
advantage 0
of 0
the 0
financial 0
opportunities 0
that 0
the 1
idiot 1
Americans 1
forfeit, 0
but 0
otherwise 0
do 0
not 0
seem 0
to 0
have 0
any 0
strategic 0
sense 0
of 0
how 0
to 0
proceed 0
in 0
the 0
drama 0
unfolding 0
in 0
front 0
of 0
their 0
eyes. 0

For 0
China, 0
money 0
is 0
now 0
all. 0

The 0
Russians 0
are 0
infected 0
with 0
the 0
American 0
propaganda 0
infused 1
into 1
their 1
veins 1
during 0
the 0
Yeltsin 0
era 0
when 0
Russia 0
was 0
an 0
American 0
puppet 0
state. 0

Slowly, 0
if 0
not 0
surely, 0
the 0
Russians 0
are 0
coming 0
to 0
their 0
senses 0
and 0
realizing 0
that 0
they 0
have 0
no 0
American 0
“partner.” 0

If 1
Trump 1
is 1
defeated 1
and 1
moved 1
off 1
the 1
table, 1
what 1
happens 1
when 1
Russia 1
and 1
China 1
finally 1
realize 1
that 1
there 1
is 1
to 1
be 1
no 1
conciliation 1
with 1
Washington? 1

When 1
all 1
the 1
false 1
hopes 1
and 1
bets 1
of 1
the 1
Russian 1
and 1
Chinese 1
governments 1
of 1
conciliation 1
on 1
the 1
basis 1
of 1
mutual 1
economic 1
interests 1
come 1
to 1
naught, 1
what 1
happens? 1

It 1
will 1
be 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
life 1
on 1
earth. 1

The 0
Russiagate 0
“investigation” 0
appears 0
to 0
be 0
timed 0
to 0
influence 0
the 0
midterm 0
elections 0
with 0
unsubstantiated 0
accusations 0
made 0
just 0
before 0
the 0
elections 0
in 0
an 0
attempt 0
to 0
produce 0
a 0
Democratic 0
Congress 0
that 0
would 0
impeach 0
President 0
Trump 0
on 0
false 0
charges. 0

The 0
presstitutes 0
would 0
cover 0
up 0
the 0
frameup. 0

In 0
other 0
words, 0
the 0
real 0
election 0
meddling 0
is 0
being 0
done 0
by 0
the 0
Russiagate 0
“investigation.” 0
See 0
here 0
and 0
here. 0

Such 1
an 1
impeachment 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
coup. 1

The 1
consequence 1
would 1
be 1
deep 1
and 1
permanent 1
divisions 1
in 1
American 1
political 1
life 1
and 1
more 1
rabid 1
Russiaphobia 1
that 1
would 1
result 1
in 1
war. 1

The 0
danger 0
is 0
real 0
that 0
the 0
Democrats’ 0
Russiagate 0
“investigation” 0
aided 0
and 0
abetted 0
by 0
the 0
presstitute 0
media 0
will 0
result 0
in 0
nuclear 0
Armageddon. 0
