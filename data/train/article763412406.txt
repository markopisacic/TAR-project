"Free 0 87 20

are 1 87 44
subject 1 87 44
to 1 87 44
strict 1 87 44
security? 1 87 44

Why 1 87 45
are 0 87 45
children 0 87 45
being 0 87 45
mutilated 1 87 45
and 1 87 45
forcefully 1 87 45
raped 1 87 45
while 0 87 45
the 1 87 45
law 1 87 45
looks 1 87 45
the 1 87 45
other 1 87 45
way? 1 87 45

Forcefully 1 87 46

looks 1 87 46
the 1 87 46
other 1 87 46
way? 1 87 46

Why? 1 87 47

Why 1 87 48
are 0 87 48
animals 0 87 48
slaughtered 0 87 48
in 0 87 48
agony 1 87 48
and 1 87 48
terror 1 87 48
and 0 87 48
Halal 0 87 48
imposed 0 87 48
on 0 87 48
all 0 87 48
of 0 87 48
us 0 87 48
in 0 87 48
a 0 87 48
country 0 87 48
that 0 87 48
has 0 87 48
legislated 0 87 48
against 0 87 48
unstunned 0 87 48
slaughter? 0 87 48

Why?" 1 87 49

“Why 1 87 50
is 0 87 50
it 0 87 50
so 0 87 50
easy, 0 87 50
Theresa 0 87 50
May, 0 87 50
to 0 87 50
jail 0 87 50
Tommy 0 87 50
Robinson, 0 87 50
but 0 87 50
so 0 87 50
difficult 0 87 50
to 0 87 50
do 0 87 50
anything 0 87 50
at 0 87 50
all 0 87 50
about 0 87 50
the 0 87 50
monstrous 1 87 50
crimes 0 87 50
committed 0 87 50
in 0 87 50
the 0 87 50
name 0 87 50
of 0 87 50
Islam 0 87 50
all 0 87 50
over 0 87 50
this 0 87 50
country 0 87 50
every 1 87 50
day? 1 87 50

Why?” 1 87 51
Waters 0 87 51
asked. 0 87 51

Well, 0 87 52
the 0 87 52
questions 0 87 52
are 0 87 52
obviously 0 87 52
rhetorical. 0 87 52

We 0 87 53
know 0 87 53
why. 0 87 53

The 0 87 54
UK 0 87 54
is 0 87 54
frightened 0 87 54
of 0 87 54
the 0 87 54
Islamists, 0 87 54
and 0 87 54
by 0 87 54
being 0 87 54
frightened 0 87 54
into 0 87 54
submission, 0 87 54
they 0 87 54
are 0 87 54
being 0 87 54
complicit 0 87 54
in 0 87 54
the 0 87 54
crimes 0 87 54
of 0 87 54
the 0 87 54
devout 0 87 54
Muslims 0 87 54
there. 0 87 54

My 0 87 55
speech 0 87 55
at 0 87 55
the 0 87 55
#FreeTommy 1 87 55
protest 0 87 55
yesterday. 0 87 55

We 0 87 56
need 0 87 56
answers 0 87 56
to 0 87 56
our 0 87 56
questions, 0 87 56
and 0 87 56
we 0 87 56
need 0 87 56
an 0 87 56
MP 0 87 56
in 0 87 56
Parliament 0 87 56
who 0 87 56
will 0 87 56
ask 0 87 56
them. 0 87 56

Kassam 0 87 58
also 0 87 58
spoke 0 87 58
at 0 87 58
the 0 87 58
event, 0 87 58
reminding 0 87 58
supporters 0 87 58
of 0 87 58
what 0 87 58
was 0 87 58
happening 0 87 58
all 0 87 58
across 0 87 58
Europe 0 87 58
due 0 87 58
the 0 87 58
mass 0 87 58
influx 0 87 58
of 0 87 58
Muslim 0 87 58
migrants. 0 87 58

Then 0 87 59
he 0 87 59
encouraged 0 87 59
them 0 87 59
with 0 87 59
a 0 87 59
piece 0 87 59
of 0 87 59
American 0 87 59
history. 0 87 59

“I’m 0 87 60
sure 0 87 60
we 0 87 60
have 0 87 60
some 0 87 60
American 1 87 60
friends 1 87 60
in 0 87 60
the 0 87 60
crowd, 0 87 60
on 0 87 60
stage, 0 87 60
and 0 87 60
watching 0 87 60
at 0 87 60
home,” 0 87 60
Kassam 0 87 60
concluded. 0 87 60

“You 0 87 61
know 0 87 61
there 0 87 61
was 0 87 61
a 0 87 61
man 0 87 61
called 0 87 61
Paul 0 87 61
Revere. 0 87 61

He 0 87 62
rode 0 87 62
through 0 87 62
the 0 87 62
night 0 87 62
on 0 87 62
his 0 87 62
horse. 0 87 62

He 0 87 63
said, 0 87 63
‘The 0 87 63
British 0 87 63
are 0 87 63
coming, 0 87 63
the 0 87 63
British 0 87 63
are 0 87 63
coming!’ 0 87 63
Well, 0 87 63
let 0 87 63
you 0 87 63
tell 0 87 63
you 0 87 63
something; 0 87 63
we’re 0 87 63
here 0 87 63
today 0 87 63
to 0 87 63
say 0 87 63
a 0 87 63
similar 0 87 63
thing: 0 87 63
The 1 87 63
British 1 87 63
are 1 87 63
coming 1 87 63
back!” 1 87 63

I 0 87 64
do 0 87 64
hope 0 87 64
that 0 87 64
is 0 87 64
true, 0 87 64
but 0 87 64
unless 0 87 64
the 0 87 64
Brits 0 87 64
are 0 87 64
going 0 87 64
to 0 87 64
put 0 87 64
the 0 87 64
same 0 87 64
kind 0 87 64
of 0 87 64
fear 0 87 64
in 0 87 64
their 0 87 64
representatives 0 87 64
that 0 87 64
the 0 87 64
Muslims 0 87 64
are 0 87 64
doing, 0 87 64
they 0 87 64
can't 0 87 64
expect 0 87 64
to 0 87 64
do 0 87 64
what 0 87 64
they 0 87 64
want 0 87 64
to 0 87 64
do. 0 87 64

What 0 87 65
Britain 0 87 65
needs 0 87 65
is 0 87 65
a 0 87 65
return 0 87 65
to 0 87 65
the 1 87 65
God 1 87 65
of 1 87 65
their 1 87 65
forefathers, 1 87 65
the 0 87 65
One 0 87 65
Oliver 0 87 65
Cromwell 0 87 65
served. 0 87 65

They 0 87 66
need 0 87 66
to 0 87 66
fear 0 87 66
Him 0 87 66
more 0 87 66
than 0 87 66
they 0 87 66
do 0 87 66
the 0 87 66
Islamic 0 87 66
terrorists 0 87 66
and 0 87 66
rape 0 87 66
gangs. 0 87 66

Then, 1 87 67
and 1 87 67
only 1 87 67
then, 1 87 67
will 0 87 67
they 0 87 67
render 0 87 67
justice 0 87 67
for 0 87 67
the 0 87 67
Muslim 0 87 67
criminals, 0 87 67
rid 0 87 67
their 0 87 67
land 0 87 67
of 0 87 67
such 0 87 67
public 0 87 67
idolatry 1 87 67
and 0 87 67
protect 0 87 67
the 0 87 67
people 0 87 67
like 0 87 67
Tommy 0 87 67
Robinson 0 87 67
who 0 87 67
rightly 0 87 67
tell 0 87 67
the 0 87 67
truth. 0 87 67
