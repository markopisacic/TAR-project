never 0
asked 0
for 0
tape, 0
after 0
an 0
excerpt 0
of 0
the 0
footage 0
aired 0
on 0
Tucker 0
Carlson 0
Tonight. 0

At 0
10:16 0
p.m., 0
two 0
men 0
drag 0
a 0
“fallen 0
victim” 0
across 0
the 0
parking 0
lot. 0

The 0
men 0
position 0
the 0
victim 0
behind 0
a 0
Ford 0
pickup 0
truck, 0
presumably 0
to 0
shield 0
themselves 0
and 0
the 0
victim 0
from 0
taking 0
any 0
further 0
incoming 0
rounds 0
as 0
they 0
attempted 0
to 0
give 0
the 0
victim 0
medical 0
assistance. 0

“Later 0
at 0
ten-twenty-four 0
p.m., 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
men 0
places 0
his 0
shirt 0
across 0
the 0
victim’s 0
face 0
and 0
then 0
at 0
ten-thirty-two 0
a 0
man 0
places 0
what 0
appears 0
to 0
be 0
a 0
blanket 0
or 0
towel 0
over 0
the 0
body 0
after 0
they 0
had 0
given 0
up 0
hope,” 0
Tucker 0
Carlson 0
said. 0

“Police 0
only 0
arrive 0
in 0
this 0
area 0
for 0
the 0
first 0
time 0
around 0
ten-forty-five 0
p.m. 0
when 0
the 0
body 0
is 0
still 0
there.” 0
The 0
victim’s 0
body 0
was 0
eventually 0
was 0
loaded 0
into 0
the 0
back 0
of 0
a 0
Ford 0
Raptor 0
pickup 0
truck 0
at 0
11:50 0
p.m. 0
and 0
taken 0
away. 0

Astonishingly, 0
between 0
the 0
times 0
of 0
10:13 0
p.m. 0
and 0
10:16 0
p.m. 0
a 0
good 0
amount 0
of 0
debris 0
can 0
be 0
seen 0
being 0
pushed 0
downward 0
and 0
sideways 0
in 0
front 0
of 0
the 0
camera 0
which 0
Carlson 0
claims 0
is 0
from 0
a 0
“helicopter 0
hovering 0
overhead.” 0
A 0
quick 0
review 0
of 0
flight 0
records 0
during 0
that 0
time 0
reveals 0
that 0
a 0
squadron 0
of 0
EC-130 0
Eurocopters 0
departed 0
from 0
Maverick 0
Leasing 0
LLC 0
at 0
10:12 0
p.m., 0
several 0
of 0
which 0
appear 0
to 0
have 0
overflown 0
the 0
parking 0
lot 0
where 0
the 0
victim 0
and 0
debris 0
were 0
seen. 0

However, 0
the 0
departure 0
of 0
the 0
choppers 0
and 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
several 0
of 0
them 0
overflew 0
the 0
parking 0
lot 0
does 0
not 0
explain 0
all 0
of 0
the 0
debris 0
being 0
kicked 0
up 0
from 0
by 0
a 0
heavy 0
downdraft, 0
prop 0
wash, 0
possibly 0
from 0
a 0
helicopter 0
hovering 0
in 0
place 0
much 0
closer. 0

In 0
fact, 0
the 0
downdraft 0
appears 0
to 0
be 0
constant 0
from 0
10:13-10:16 0
p.m. 0
and 0
not 0
intermittent 0
as 0
if 0
several 0
choppers 0
had 0
just 0
passed 0
overhead. 0

According 0
to 0
Carlson, 0
the 0
owner 0
of 0
the 0
tape 0
maintains 0
that 0
law 1
enforcement 1
investigators 1
have 1
never 1
asked 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
footage. 1

A 0
preliminary 0
report 0
on 0
the 0
shooting 0
released 0
by 0
the 0
LVMPD 0
on 0
Friday 0
only 0

outside 0
of 0
the 0
venue, 0
two 0
of 0
which 0
were 0
over 0
a 0

However, 0
the 0
