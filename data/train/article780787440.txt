VATICAN 0
CITY 0
— 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
on 0
Monday 0
asked 0
forgiveness 0
for 0
child 0
abuse 0
crimes 0
and 0
cover-ups 0
within 0
the 0
Catholic 0
Church, 0
admitting 0
that 0
the 0
pain 0
of 0
victims 0
“was 0
long 0
ignored, 0
kept 0
quiet 0
or 0
silenced.” 0

The 0
strongly 0
worded 0
statement 0
came 0
ahead 0
of 0
an 0
Aug. 0
25-26 0
papal 0
pilgrimage 0
to 0
Ireland, 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
countries 0
rocked 1
by 1
clergy 1
sex 1
abuse 1
scandals, 1
and 0
followed 0
an 0
expose 0
of 0
pedophile 0
priests 0
in 0
the 0
U.S. 0

“The 1
heart-wrenching 1
pain 1
of 0
these 0
victims, 0
which 1
cries 1
out 1
to 1
heaven, 1
was 0
long 0
ignored, 0
kept 0
quiet 0
or 0
silenced,” 0
Francis 0
said 0
in 0
a 0
Letter 0
to 0
the 0
People 0
of 0
God, 0
a 0
rarely-issued 0
address 0
to 0
the 0
world’s 0
1.3 0

Catholics. 0

On 0
Aug. 0
17, 0
a 0
Pennsylvania 0
grand 0
jury 0
report, 0
based 0
on 0
hidden 0
archives 0
of 0
the 0
U.S. 0
church, 0
named 0
301 0
priests 0
from 0
the 0
state 0
as 0
credibly 1
accused 1
child 1
sex 1
abusers 1
and 0
accused 0
church 0
leaders 0
of 0
a 0
systematic 0
cover-up 0
of 0
their 0
crimes. 0

The 0
report 0
“detailed 0
the 0
experiences 0
of 0
at 0
least 0
a 0
thousand 0
survivors, 0
victims 0
of 0
sexual 0
abuse, 0
the 0
abuse 0
of 0
power 0
and 0
of 0
conscience 0
at 0
the 0
hands 0
of 0
priests 0
over 0
a 0
period 0
of 0
approximately 0
seventy 0
years,” 0
Francis 0
acknowledged. 0

“It 1
is 1
essential 1
that 1
we, 1
as 1
a 1
Church, 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
acknowledge 1
and 1
condemn, 1
with 1
sorrow 1
and 1
shame, 1
the 1
atrocities 1
perpetrated 1
by 1
consecrated 1
persons, 1
clerics, 1
and 1
all 1
those 1
entrusted 1
with 1
the 1
mission 1
of 1
watching 1
over 1
and 1
caring 1
for 1
those 1
most 1
vulnerable,” 1
he 0
said. 0

“Let 0
us 0
beg 0
forgiveness 0
for 0
our 0
own 0
sins 0
and 0
the 0
sins 0
of 0
others,” 0
he 0
added. 0

In 0
the 0
run-up 0
to 0
Francis’ 0
visit 0
to 0
Ireland, 0
the 0
head 0
of 0
the 0
Irish 0
Catholic 0
Church, 0
Archbishop 0
Eamon 0
Martin, 0
said 0
he 0
expected 0
the 0
pope 0
to 0
meet 0
with 0
victims 0
of 0
clergy 0
sex 0
abuse 0
and 0
to 0
promise 0
effective 0
remedies. 0

“I’m 1
not 1
sure 1
what 1
his 1
words 1
will 1
be 1
and 1
I’m 1
not 1
sure 1
that 1
a 1
simple 1
apology 1
is 1
what 1
survivors 1
of 1
abuse 1
want,” 1
Martin 0
said 0
in 0
a 0
BBC 0
interview. 0

“If 1
he 1
expresses 1
an 1
apology, 1
it 1
needs 1
to 1
be 1
more 1
than 1
‘we’re 1
sorry,’” 1
he 0
added. 0

In 0
his 0
letter, 0
Francis 0
repeated 0
a 0
famous 0
2005 0
quote 0
by 0
his 0
predecessor 0
Benedict 0
XVI, 0
who, 0
a 0
month 0
before 0
being 0
elected 0
pope, 0
lamented 0
“how 1
much 1
filth” 1
there 0
was 0
in 0
the 0
Catholic 0
Church. 0

“With 1
shame 1
and 1
repentance, 1
we 1
acknowledge 1
as 1
an 1
ecclesial 1
community 1
that 1
we 1
were 1
not 1
where 1
we 1
should 1
have 1
been, 1
that 1
we 1
did 1
not 1
act 1
in 1
a 1
timely 1
manner, 1
realizing 1
the 1
magnitude 1
and 1
the 1
gravity 1
of 1
the 1
damage 1
done 1
to 1
so 1
many 1
lives. 1

We 1
showed 1
no 1
care 1
for 1
the 1
little 1
ones; 1
we 1
abandoned 1
them,” 1
Francis 0
said. 0

“Looking 0
back 0
to 0
the 0
past, 0
no 1
effort 1
to 1
beg 1
pardon 1
and 1
to 1
seek 1
to 1
repair 1
the 1
harm 1
done 1
will 1
ever 1
be 1
sufficient. 1

Looking 0
ahead 0
to 0
the 0
future, 0
no 0
effort 0
must 0
be 0
spared 0
to 0
create 0
a 0
culture 0
able 0
to 0
prevent 0
such 0
situations 0
from 0
happening, 0
but 0
also 0
to 0
prevent 0
the 0
possibility 0
of 0
their 0
being 0
covered 0
up 0
and 0
perpetuated,” 0
he 0
added. 0

Colm 0
O’Gorman, 0
an 0
Irish 0
abuse 0
survivor 0
who 0
founded 0
One 0
in 0
Four, 0
the 0
main 0
survivors’ 0
group 0
in 0
Ireland, 0
commented 0
on 0
Twitter 0
that 0
the 0
pope 0
offered 0
“Much 0
stronger 0
language 0
than 0
ever 0
used 0
before.” 0

But 0
O’Gorman 0
added: 0
“(The 1
pope) 1
begs 1
for 1
forgiveness, 1
but 1
still 1
does 1
not 1
admit 1
or 1
own 1
the 1
deliberate 1
policy 1
of 1
cover 1
up 1
designed 1
& 1
implemented 1
by 1
the 1
#Vatican.” 1

Like 1
his 1
predecessor, 1
Francis 1
has 1
promised 1
“zero 1
tolerance” 1
on 1
child 1
abuse, 1
but 1
scandals 1
have 1
kept 1
recurring 1
in 1
several 1
parts 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
— 1
including 1
in 1
Australia 1
recently. 1

In 0
January, 0
the 0
pope 0
was 0
accused 0
of 0
insensitivity 0
and 0
tone-deafness 0
after 0
insisting, 0
during 0
a 0
visit 0
to 0
Chile, 0
that 0
local 0
abuse 0
survivors 0
had 0
no 0
“proof” 0
against 0
a 0
bishop 0
who 0
allegedly 0
witnessed 0
abuse 0
and 0
failed 0
to 0
report 0
it. 0

Following 0
an 0
outcry, 1
Francis 0
apologized 0
for 0
his 0
remarks, 0
held 0
private 0
meetings 0
with 0
victims 0
at 0
the 0
Vatican, 0
and, 0
after 0
envoys 0
he 0
sent 0
to 0
Chile 0
backed 0
up 0
victims’ 0
claims, 0
the 0
entire 0
leadership 0
of 0
the 0
Chilean 0
Catholic 0
church 0
tendered 0
their 0
resignations. 0

According 1
to 1
church 1
expert 1
John 1
L 1
Allen, 1
an 1
editor 1
at 1
specialized 1
website 1
Crux.com, 1
the 1
Catholic 1
Church 1
has 1
a 1
structural 1
problem 1
when 1
it 1
comes 1
to 1
dealing 1
with 1
cover 1
up 1
accusations. 1

“Sixteen 1
years 1
since 1
the 1
crisis 1
first 1
erupted 1
in 1
the 1
U.S., 1
almost 1
ten 1
years 1
since 1
that 1
happened 1
in 1
Ireland, 1
and 1
now 1
more 1
than 1
five 1
years 1
since 1
Francis 1
was 1
elected, 1
the 1
Catholic 1
Church 1
still 1
has 1
no 1
credible, 1
transparent 1
process 1
for 1
handling 1
cases 1
when 1
the 1
accusation 1
against 1
a 1
bishop 1
isn’t 1
the 1
direct 1
commission 1
of 1
abuse 1
but 1
rather 1
covering 1
up 1
someone 1
else’s 1
crimes,” 1
Allen 1
said 1
in 1
a 1
Sunday 1
column. 1
