which 1 79 3
cries 1 79 3
out 1 79 3

“It 1 79 6
is 1 79 6
essential 1 79 6
that 1 79 6
we, 1 79 6
as 1 79 6

Church, 1 79 6
be 1 79 6
able 1 79 6
to 1 79 6
acknowledge 1 79 6
and 1 79 6
condemn, 1 79 6
with 1 79 6
sorrow 1 79 6

shame, 1 79 6
the 1 79 6
atrocities 1 79 6
perpetrated 1 79 6
by 1 79 6
consecrated 1 79 6
persons, 1 79 6

all 1 79 6
those 1 79 6

with 1 79 6
the 1 79 6

vulnerable,” 1 79 6
he 0 79 6
said. 0 79 6

“Let 0 79 7
us 0 79 7

he 0 79 7

In 0 79 8
the 0 79 8

to 0 79 8

Archbishop 0 79 8

expected 0 79 8
the 0 79 8

“I’m 1 79 9
not 1 79 9
sure 1 79 9
what 1 79 9
his 1 79 9
words 1 79 9
will 1 79 9
be 1 79 9
and 1 79 9
I’m 1 79 9
not 1 79 9
sure 1 79 9
that 1 79 9
a 1 79 9
simple 1 79 9
apology 1 79 9
is 1 79 9
what 1 79 9
survivors 1 79 9
of 1 79 9
abuse 1 79 9
want,” 1 79 9
Martin 0 79 9
said 0 79 9
in 0 79 9
a 0 79 9
BBC 0 79 9
interview. 0 79 9

“If 1 79 10
he 1 79 10
expresses 1 79 10
an 1 79 10
apology, 1 79 10
it 1 79 10
needs 1 79 10
to 1 79 10
be 1 79 10
more 1 79 10
than 1 79 10
‘we’re 1 79 10
sorry,’” 1 79 10
he 0 79 10
added. 0 79 10

In 0 79 11
his 0 79 11
letter, 0 79 11
Francis 0 79 11
repeated 0 79 11
a 0 79 11
famous 0 79 11
2005 0 79 11
quote 0 79 11
by 0 79 11
his 0 79 11
predecessor 0 79 11
Benedict 0 79 11
XVI, 0 79 11
who, 0 79 11
a 0 79 11
month 0 79 11
before 0 79 11
being 0 79 11
elected 0 79 11
pope, 0 79 11
lamented 0 79 11
“how 1 79 11
much 1 79 11
filth” 1 79 11
there 0 79 11
was 0 79 11
in 0 79 11
the 0 79 11
Catholic 0 79 11
Church. 0 79 11

“With 1 79 12
shame 1 79 12
and 1 79 12
repentance, 1 79 12
we 1 79 12
acknowledge 1 79 12
as 1 79 12
an 1 79 12
ecclesial 1 79 12
community 1 79 12
that 1 79 12
we 1 79 12
were 1 79 12
not 1 79 12
where 1 79 12
we 1 79 12
should 1 79 12
have 1 79 12
been, 1 79 12
that 1 79 12
we 1 79 12
did 1 79 12
not 1 79 12
act 1 79 12
in 1 79 12
a 1 79 12
timely 1 79 12
manner, 1 79 12
realizing 1 79 12
the 1 79 12
magnitude 1 79 12
and 1 79 12
the 1 79 12
gravity 1 79 12
of 1 79 12
the 1 79 12
damage 1 79 12
done 1 79 12
to 1 79 12
so 1 79 12
many 1 79 12
lives. 1 79 12

We 1 79 13
showed 1 79 13
no 1 79 13
care 1 79 13
for 1 79 13
the 1 79 13
little 1 79 13
ones; 1 79 13
we 1 79 13
abandoned 1 79 13
them,” 1 79 13
Francis 0 79 13
said. 0 79 13

“Looking 0 79 14
back 0 79 14
to 0 79 14
the 0 79 14
past, 0 79 14
no 1 79 14
effort 1 79 14
to 1 79 14
beg 1 79 14
pardon 1 79 14
and 1 79 14
to 1 79 14
seek 1 79 14
to 1 79 14
repair 1 79 14
the 1 79 14
harm 1 79 14
done 1 79 14
will 1 79 14
ever 1 79 14
be 1 79 14
sufficient. 1 79 14

Looking 0 79 15
ahead 0 79 15
to 0 79 15
the 0 79 15
future, 0 79 15
no 0 79 15
effort 0 79 15
must 0 79 15
be 0 79 15
spared 0 79 15
to 0 79 15
create 0 79 15
a 0 79 15
culture 0 79 15
able 0 79 15
to 0 79 15
prevent 0 79 15
such 0 79 15
situations 0 79 15
from 0 79 15
happening, 0 79 15
but 0 79 15
also 0 79 15
to 0 79 15
prevent 0 79 15
the 0 79 15
possibility 0 79 15
of 0 79 15
their 0 79 15
being 0 79 15
covered 0 79 15
up 0 79 15
and 0 79 15
perpetuated,” 0 79 15
he 0 79 15
added. 0 79 15

Colm 0 79 16
O’Gorman, 0 79 16
an 0 79 16
Irish 0 79 16
abuse 0 79 16
survivor 0 79 16
who 0 79 16
founded 0 79 16
One 0 79 16
in 0 79 16
Four, 0 79 16
the 0 79 16
main 0 79 16
survivors’ 0 79 16
group 0 79 16
in 0 79 16
Ireland, 0 79 16
commented 0 79 16
on 0 79 16
Twitter 0 79 16
that 0 79 16
the 0 79 16
pope 0 79 16
offered 0 79 16
“Much 0 79 16
stronger 0 79 16
language 0 79 16
than 0 79 16
ever 0 79 16
used 0 79 16
before.” 0 79 16

But 0 79 17
O’Gorman 0 79 17
added: 0 79 17
“(The 1 79 17
pope) 1 79 17
begs 1 79 17
for 1 79 17
forgiveness, 1 79 17
but 1 79 17
still 1 79 17
does 1 79 17
not 1 79 17
admit 1 79 17
or 1 79 17
own 1 79 17
the 1 79 17
deliberate 1 79 17
policy 1 79 17
of 1 79 17
cover 1 79 17
up 1 79 17
designed 1 79 17
& 1 79 17
implemented 1 79 17
by 1 79 17
the 1 79 17
#Vatican.” 1 79 17

Like 1 79 18
his 1 79 18
predecessor, 1 79 18
Francis 1 79 18
has 1 79 18
promised 1 79 18
“zero 1 79 18
tolerance” 1 79 18
on 1 79 18
child 1 79 18
abuse, 1 79 18
but 1 79 18
scandals 1 79 18
have 1 79 18
kept 1 79 18
recurring 1 79 18
in 1 79 18
several 1 79 18
parts 1 79 18
of 1 79 18
the 1 79 18
world 1 79 18
— 1 79 18
including 1 79 18
in 1 79 18
Australia 1 79 18
recently. 1 79 18

In 0 79 19
January, 0 79 19
the 0 79 19
pope 0 79 19
was 0 79 19
accused 0 79 19
of 0 79 19
insensitivity 0 79 19
and 0 79 19
tone-deafness 0 79 19
after 0 79 19
insisting, 0 79 19
during 0 79 19
a 0 79 19
visit 0 79 19
to 0 79 19
Chile, 0 79 19
that 0 79 19
local 0 79 19
abuse 0 79 19
survivors 0 79 19
had 0 79 19
no 0 79 19
“proof” 0 79 19
against 0 79 19
a 0 79 19
bishop 0 79 19
who 0 79 19
allegedly 0 79 19
witnessed 0 79 19
abuse 0 79 19
and 0 79 19
failed 0 79 19
to 0 79 19
report 0 79 19
it. 0 79 19

Following 0 79 20
an 0 79 20
outcry, 1 79 20
Francis 0 79 20
apologized 0 79 20
for 0 79 20
his 0 79 20
remarks, 0 79 20
held 0 79 20
private 0 79 20
meetings 0 79 20
with 0 79 20
victims 0 79 20
at 0 79 20
the 0 79 20
Vatican, 0 79 20
and, 0 79 20
after 0 79 20
envoys 0 79 20
he 0 79 20
sent 0 79 20
to 0 79 20
Chile 0 79 20
backed 0 79 20
up 0 79 20
victims’ 0 79 20
claims, 0 79 20
the 0 79 20
entire 0 79 20
leadership 0 79 20
of 0 79 20
the 0 79 20
Chilean 0 79 20
Catholic 0 79 20
church 0 79 20
tendered 0 79 20
their 0 79 20
resignations. 0 79 20

to 1 79 21

an 1 79 21
editor 1 79 21
at 1 79 21

website 1 79 21
Crux.com, 1 79 21
the 1 79 21
Catholic 1 79 21
Church 1 79 21
has 1 79 21
a 1 79 21
structural 1 79 21
problem 1 79 21
when 1 79 21
it 1 79 21
comes 1 79 21
to 1 79 21
dealing 1 79 21
with 1 79 21

up 1 79 21
accusations. 1 79 21

“Sixteen 1 79 22
years 1 79 22

almost 1 79 22
ten 1 79 22

now 1 79 22

five 1 79 22
years 1 79 22

the 1 79 22

the 1 79 22
