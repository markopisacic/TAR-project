Policy 0

On 0
the 0
surface, 0
the 0
latest 0
illegal 0
immigration 0
debate 0
between 0
Leftists 0
and 0
the 0
Administration 0
looks 0
like, 0
yet 0
another 0
issue 0
Progressives 0
are 0
trying 0
to 0
undermine 0
progress 0
being 0
done 0
by 0
the 0
president. 0

No 0
one 0
should 0
be 0
surprised 0
by 0
the 0
crackdown 0
on 0
illegals 0
entering 0
the 0
country, 0
especially 0
since 0
it 0
was 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
major 0
campaign 0
promises 0
Donald 0
Trump 0
made 0
before 0
getting 0
elected. 0

When 0
it 0
comes 0
to 0
the 0
separation 0
of 0
children 0
from 0
their 0
families, 0
there 0
is 0
nothing 0
new 0
today 0
that 0
was 0
not 0
being 0
done 0
during 0
the 0
Obama 0
reign. 0

In 0
2013, 0
Obama 0
began 0
bringing 0
into 0
the 0
US 0
literally 0
over 0
a 0
hundred 0
thousand 0
people, 0
mainly 0
below 0
age 0
21. 0

They 0
were 0
bused, 0
flown, 0
and 0
met 0
at 0
the 0
US 0
border 0
with 0
Mexico 0
by 0
the 0
Department 0
of 0
Homeland 0
Security 0
under 0
the 0
direction 0
of 0
Obama 0
to 0
do 0
so. 0

Since 0
most 0
of 0
them 0
were 0
adolescents 0
and 0
older 0
teenagers 0
they 0
could 0
not 0
be 0
set 0
free, 0
thus 0
Obama 0
ordered 0
various 0
military 0
bases 0
to 0
house 0
these 0
children. 0

The 0
surge 0
of 0
children 0
into 0
the 0
US 0
from 0
various 0
countries 0
south 0
of 0
the 0
border 0
was 0
said 0
to 0
be 0
the 0
result 0
of 0
economics, 0
high 0
crime 0
rates, 0
and 0
actual 0
threats 0
from 0
organized 0
crime 0
entities. 0

Another 0
excuse 1
used 0
by 0
the 0
Obama 0
government 0
was 0
to 0
bring 0
them 0
here 0
to 0
find 0
their 0
families 0
already 0
in 0
the 0
US. 0

Thus, 0
the 0
idea 0
that 0
separating 1
children 0
from 0
their 0
parents 0
as 0
being 0
something 0
new, 0
done 0
only 0
by 0
the 0
Trump 0
Administration 0
is 0
absurd, 1
since 0
we 0
really 0
have 0
no 0
idea 0
whether 0
the 0
children 0
brought 0
here 0
during 0
the 0
Obama 0
reign 0
were 0
intentionally 0
separated 1
from 0
their 0
parents 0
by 0
the 0
US 0
government 0
at 0
that 0
time, 0
or 0
not. 0

We 0
have 0
only 0
what 0
little 0
information 0
the 0
government 0
told 0
us 0
then, 0
which 0
was 0
not 0
very 0
much, 0
considering 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
Obama 0
wanted 0
to 0
keep 0
as 0
much 0
of 0
this 0
situation 0
as 0
secret 0
as 0
possible. 0

What 0
many 0
do 0
not 0
realize 0
is, 0
today's 0
policy 0
of 0
separating 1
underage 0
siblings 0
from 0
their 0
parents 0
once 0
they 0
cross 0
the 0
border 0
illegally 0
into 0
the 0
US 0
seems 0
to 0
be 0
a 0
planned 0
event 0
by 0
the 0
US 0
government 0
going 0
all 0
the 0
way 0
back 0
to 0
the 0
domestic 0
military 0
exercises 0
known 0
as 0
Jade 0
Helm 0
in 0
2015. 0

Many 0
remember 0
the 0
military 0
taking 0
over 0
several 0
Walmart 0
locations, 0
mainly 0
in 0
Texas, 0
during 0
the 0
Jade 0
Helm 0
exercises. 0

This, 0
along 0
with 0
the 0
federal 0
government 0
grab 0
of 0
millions 0
of 0
acres 0
of 0
land 0
during 0
the 0
Obama 0
years, 0
speaks 0
volumes 0
in 0
the 0
government's 0
plan 0
to 0
be 0
able 0
to 0
handle 0
millions 0
of 0
people. 0

Since 0
Obama 0
planned 0
to 0
have 0
over 0
a 0
million 0
Muslim 0
refugees 0
brought 0
into 0
the 0
US 0
over 0
a 0
short 0
period 0
of 0
time, 0
along 0
with 0
the 0
hundreds 0
of 0
thousands 0
of 0
illegal 0
immigrants 0
coming 0
in, 0
one 0
can 0
understand 0
the 0
reason 0
the 0
Feds 0
had 0
to 0
have 0
the 0
Walmart 0
stores 0
and 0
so 0
much 0
land, 0
as 0
they 0
needed 0
housing 0
for 0
the 0
millions 0
they 0
planned 0
to 0
bring 0
in. 0

Despite 0
President 0
Trump 0
signing 0
an 0
Executive 0
Order 0
suspending 0
Syrian 0
refugees 0
from 0
entering 0
the 0
US 0
for 0
120 0
days 0
on 0
Jan. 0
26, 0
2017 0
while 0
security 0
measures 0
were 0
reviewed, 0
the 0
US 0
still 0
imported 0
110,000 0
refugees 0
from 0
Syria 0
and 0
various 0
other 0
countries 0
into 0
the 0
US 0
in 0
2017 0
alone, 0
up 0
from 0
85,000 0
the 0
previous 0
year. 0

These 0
numbers 0
follow 0
Obama's 0
projections 0
of 0
the 0
expected 0
amount 0
of 0
refugees 0
permitted 0
to 0
come 0
to 0
the 0
US. 0

Of 0
course, 0
as 0
with 0
the 0
number 0
of 0
illegal 0
immigrants 0
entering 0
our 0
county, 0
the 0
Feds 0
downplay 0
the 0
actual 0
number 0
which 0
always 0
ends 0
up 0
to 0
be 0
more 0
than 0
quadruple 0
their 0
stated 0
number. 0

What 0
we 0
seem 0
to 0
have 0
here 0
with 0
the 0
illegal 0
immigration 0
situation 0
today 0
is 0
some 1
very 1
good 1
actors 1
on 1
the 1
Left 1
accusing 0
the 0
Trump 0
Administration 0
of 0
being 0
cruel 1
and 0
insensitive 1
with 0
separating 1
children 0
from 0
their 0
families 0
once 0
they 0
cross 0
the 0
Mexican 0
border 0
into 0
the 0
US. 0

When 0
in 0
fact, 0
their 0
idol, 1
Obama 0
did 0
the 0
same 0
thing 0
for 0
years 0
during 0
his 0
time 0
in 0
power. 0

What 0
they 0
do 0
not 0
want 0
to 0
admit 0
to 0
is 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
today's 0
illegal 0
immigration 0
picture 0
is 0
one 0
that 0
follows 0
the 0
Obama 0
plan 0
on 0
dealing 0
with 0
the 0
influx 0
of 0
illegals 0
to 0
a 0
carbon 0
copy. 0

President 0
Trump, 0
on 0
the 0
other 0
hand, 0
is 0
following 0
along 0
with 0
it 0
by 0
detaining 0
illegal 0
immigrants 0
at 0
the 0
border 0
and 0
separating 1
children 0
from 0
their 0
apparent 0
families. 0

Since 0
no 0
one 0
can 0
know 0
if 0
the 0
children 0
really 0
belong 0
to 0
the 0
illegals 0
who 0
say 0
they 0
are 0
their 0
parents, 0
they 0
are 0
separated 1
until 0
that 0
can 0
be 0
verified, 0
along 0
with 0
other 0
background 0
findings. 0

The 0
bottom 0
line 0
is, 0
both 0
the 0
Left 0
and 0
the 0
Trump 0
Administration 0
seem 0
to 0
be 0
following 0
along 0
with 0
a 0
plan 0
of 0
action 0
going 0
back 0
to 0
Jade 0
Helm 0
which 0
paved 0
the 0
way 0
for 0
the 0
housing 0
needed 0
for 0
such 0
a 0
huge 0
influx 0
of 0
illegal 0
immigrants 0
and 0
refugees. 0

All 0
of 0
which 0
seems 0
to 0
be 0
a 0
planned 0
event. 0

In 0
any 0
case, 0
neither 0
side 0
in 0
DC 0
is 0
really 0
interested 0
in 0
solving 0
the 0
illegal 0
immigration 0
problem 0
or 0
cares 0
about 0
the 0
children 0
involved. 0

If 0
they 0
were, 0
there 0
would 0
be 0
no 0
detention 0
and 0
separation 1
after 0
illegally 0
coming 0
into 0
the 0
US, 0
only 0
an 0
immediate 0
deportation 0
by 0
US 0
Border 0
Patrol 0
on 0
the 0
spot. 0
