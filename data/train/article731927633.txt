BUDAPEST, 0
Feb 0
18 0
(Reuters) 0
- 0
Hungarian 0
leader 0
Viktor 0
Orban 0
called 0
on 0
Sunday 0
for 0
a 0
global 0
alliance 0
against 0
migration 0
as 0
his 0
right-wing 0
populist 0
Fidesz 0
party 0
began 0
campaigning 0
for 0
an 0
April 0
8 0
election 0
in 0
which 0
it 0
is 0
expected 0
to 0
win 0
a 0
third 0
consecutive 0
landslide 0
victory. 0

Popular 0
at 0
home 0
but 0
increasingly 0
at 0
odds 0
politically 0
and 0
economically 0
with 0
mainstream 0
European 0
Union 0
peers, 0
Orban 0
has 0
thrived 0
on 0
external 0
controversy, 0
including 0
repeated 0
clashes 0
with 0
Brussels 0
and 0
lately 0
the 0
United 0
Nations. 0

Those 0
conflicts, 0
mostly 0
centred 0
on 0
migration 0
since 0
people 0
fleeing 0
war 0
and 0
poverty 0
in 0
the 0
Middle 0
East 0
and 0
Africa 0
flooded 0
into 0
Europe 0
in 0
2015, 0
have 0
intensified 0
as 0
the 0
elections 0
approach 0
and 0
Orban 1
poses 1
as 1
a 1
saviour 1
of 1
Europe's 1
Christian 1
nations. 1

"Christianity 1
is 1
Europe's 1
last 1
hope," 1
Orban 0
told 0
an 0
audience 0
of 0
party 0
faithful 0
at 0
the 0
foot 0
of 0
the 0
Royal 0
Castle 0
in 0
Budapest. 0

With 0
mass 0
immigration, 0
especially 0
from 0
Africa, 0
"our 1
worst 1
nightmares 1
can 1
come 1
true. 1

The 1
West 1
falls 1
as 1
it 1
fails 1
to 1
see 1
Europe 1
being 1
overrun." 1

Orban 0
is 0
widely 0
credited 0
for 0
reversing 0
an 0
economic 0
slump 0
in 0
Hungary 0
and 0
controlling 0
its 0
public 0
finances, 0
culminating 0
in 0
a 0
return 0
to 0
investment-grade 0
for 0
its 0
debt, 0
which 0
was 0
cut 0
to 0
'junk' 0
during 0
the 0
2008 0
global 0
economic 0
crisis. 0

To 0
achieve 0
that 0
and 0
hold 0
onto 0
power 0
the 0
prime 0
minister, 0
54, 0
has 0
used 0
methods 0
that 0
critics 0
have 0
called 0
authoritarian, 0
and 0
picked 0
fights 0
with 0
EU 0
partners, 0
especially 0
in 0
the 0
West. 0

Eastern 0
leaders, 0
most 0
notably 0
in 0
Poland, 0
have 0
followed 0
his 0
lead. 0

But 0
migration 0
dominates 0
his 0
agenda 0
now. 0

Orban 0
said 0
on 0
Sunday 0
that 0
Europe 0
faces 0
a 0
critical 0
fissure 0
between 0
nation 0
states 0
of 0
the 0
East 0
and 0
the 0
West, 0
which 0
he 0
called 0
an 0
"immigrant 0
zone, 0
a 0
mixed 0
population 0
world 0
that 0
heads 0
in 0
a 1
direction 1
different 1
from 1
ours". 1

As 0
the 0
West 0
wants 0
eastern 0
Europe 0
to 0
follow 0
its 0
lead, 0
an 0
increasingly 1
vicious 1
struggle 1
was 0
likely, 0
he 0
said, 0
alluding 0
to 0
a 0
plan 0
to 0
redraw 0
the 0
European 0
alliance 0
advocated 0
by 0
the 0
leaders 0
of 0
France 0
and 0
Germany. 0

"Absurd 0
as 0
it 0
may 0
sound 0
the 1
danger 1
we 1
face 1
comes 1
from 1
the 1
West, 1
from 1
politicians 1
in 1
Brussels, 1
Berlin 1
and 1
Paris," 1
Orban 0
said 0
to 0
loud 0
applause. 0

"Of 0
course 0
we 0
will 0
fight, 0
and 0
use 0
ever 0
stronger 0
legal 0
tools. 0

The 0
first 0
is 0
our 0
'Stop 1
Soros' 1
law." 0

Orban 0
has 0
for 0
years 0
targeted 0
Hungarian-born 0
U.S. 0
financier 0
George 0
Soros, 0
whose 0
philanthropy 0
aims 0
to 0
bolster 0
liberal 0
and 0
open-border 0
values 0
-- 0
anathema 0
to 0
Orban, 0
an 0
advocate 0
of 0
a 0
loose 0
group 0
of 0
strong 0
nation 0
states 0
that 0
reject 0
multiculturalism. 0

The 0
Hungarian 0
leader 0
has 0
advocated 0
"ethnic 0
homogeneity" 0
and 0
compared 0
Soros, 0
a 0
Jew, 0
to 0
a 0
puppet 1
master 1
unleashing 1
immigration 1
onto 1
Europe 1
to 0
undermine 0
its 0
cultural 0
and 0
economic 0
integrity. 0

A 0
defining 0
moment 0
of 0
his 0
premiership 0
came 0
in 0
2015, 0
as 0
the 0
migrant 0
crisis 0
peaked: 0
he 0
built 0
a 0
double 0
razor 0
wire 0
fence 0
that 0
became 0
the 0
symbol 0
of 0
anti-migrant 0
sentiment 0
in 0
Europe. 0

Orban 0
also 0
said 0
the 0
Hungarian 0
opposition 0
had 0
failed 0
to 0
heed 0
the 0
call 0
of 0
history 0
when 0
it 0
opposed 0
his 0
toughness 0
on 0
migrants. 0

Voters 0
have 0
responded 0
favourably 0
and 0
Orban 0
is 0
a 0
clear 0
leader 0
of 0
all 0
polls. 0

POWERFUL 0
ALLIES 0

Orban 0
has 0
conflated 0
the 0
issue 0
of 0
immigration 0
with 0
the 0
image 0
of 0
Soros, 0
87, 0
whose 0
name 0
was 0
used 0
in 0
a 0
tough 0
anti-migrant 0
bill 0
sent 0
to 0
Parliament 0
on 0
Wednesday. 0

Soros, 0
for 0
his 0
part, 0
compared 1
Orban 1
unfavourably 1
to 1
both 1
the 1
Nazis 1
and 1
the 1
Communists, 1
saying 0
his 0
rule 0
evoked 0
dark 0
tones 0
from 0
the 0
1930's 0
-- 0
when 0
Hungary 0
was 0
allied 0
with 0
Nazi 0
Germany 0
-- 0
and 0
was 0
more 0
oppressive 0
than 0
Cold 0
War 0
Soviet 0
occupation. 0

Orban 0
has 0
tightened 0
the 0
screws 0
on 0
non-government 0
organisations, 0
particularly 0
ones 0
funded 0
by 0
Soros, 0
and 0
attempted 0
to 0
close 0
a 0
prominent 0
Soros-founded 0
university. 0

Attributing 0
to 0
Soros 0
a 0
recent 0
United 0
Nations 0
plan 0
on 0
creating 0
a 0
global 0
blueprint 0
to 0
handle 0
the 0
migration 0
crisis, 0
Orban 0
said 0
he 0
anticipated 0
that 0
powerful 0
allies 0
would 0
help 0
him 0
prevent 0
the 0
U.N. 0
from 0
greasing 0
the 0
wheels 0
of 0
migration. 0

"Soros 0
has 0
antagonised 0
not 0
only 0
us 0
but 0
also 0
England, 0
President 0
Trump 0
and 0
Israel 0
too," 0
he 0
said. 0

"Everywhere 0
he 0
wants 0
to 0
get 0
migration 0
accepted. 0

It 0
won't 0
work. 0

We 0
are 0
not 0
alone 0
and 0
we 0
will 0
fight 0
together 0
... 0
and 0
we 0
will 0
succeed." 0

In 0
Europe, 0
he 0
cited 0
as 0
allies 0
Hungary's 0
fellow 0
Visegrad 0
countries 0
Slovakia, 0
the 0
Czech 0
Republic 0
and 0
Poland, 0
whose 0
ruling 0
Law 0
and 0
Justice 0
(PiS) 0
party 0
is 0
also 0
often 0
at 0
loggerheads 0
with 0
the 0
EU. 0

He 0
said 0
a 0
victory 0
for 0
Silvio 0
Berlusconi's 0
party 0
in 0
Italy's 0
March 0
4 0
election 0
would 0
strengthen 0
the 0
nationalist 0
fold. 0

"We 0
don't 0
think 0
the 0
fight 0
is 0
hopeless, 0
on 0
the 0
contrary, 0
we 0
are 0
winning," 0
Orban 0
said. 0

"The 0
V4 0
is 0
firm, 0
Croatia 0
has 0
come 0
around, 0
Austria 0
has 0
turned 0
in 0
the 0
patriotic 0
direction, 0
and 0
in 0
Bavaria 0
the 0
CSU 0
has 0
created 0
a 0
resistance." 0
