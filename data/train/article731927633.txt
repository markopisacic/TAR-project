of 1 175 8

"Christianity 1 175 9
is 1 175 9
Europe's 1 175 9
last 1 175 9
hope," 1 175 9
Orban 0 175 9

"our 1 175 10
worst 1 175 10

The 1 175 11

it 1 175 11

to 1 175 11
see 1 175 11
Europe 1 175 11
being 1 175 11
overrun." 1 175 11

Orban 0 175 12
is 0 175 12
widely 0 175 12
credited 0 175 12
for 0 175 12
reversing 0 175 12
an 0 175 12
economic 0 175 12
slump 0 175 12
in 0 175 12
Hungary 0 175 12
and 0 175 12
controlling 0 175 12
its 0 175 12

culminating 0 175 12
in 0 175 12
a 0 175 12
return 0 175 12
to 0 175 12
investment-grade 0 175 12
for 0 175 12
its 0 175 12

which 0 175 12
was 0 175 12
cut 0 175 12

To 0 175 13
achieve 0 175 13
that 0 175 13
and 0 175 13
hold 0 175 13
onto 0 175 13
power 0 175 13
the 0 175 13
prime 0 175 13
minister, 0 175 13
54, 0 175 13
has 0 175 13
used 0 175 13
methods 0 175 13
that 0 175 13
critics 0 175 13
have 0 175 13
called 0 175 13
authoritarian, 0 175 13
and 0 175 13
picked 0 175 13
fights 0 175 13
with 0 175 13
EU 0 175 13
partners, 0 175 13
especially 0 175 13
in 0 175 13
the 0 175 13

Eastern 0 175 14
leaders, 0 175 14
most 0 175 14

in 0 175 14
Poland, 0 175 14
have 0 175 14
followed 0 175 14
his 0 175 14
lead. 0 175 14

But 0 175 15
migration 0 175 15
dominates 0 175 15
his 0 175 15
agenda 0 175 15
now. 0 175 15

Orban 0 175 16
said 0 175 16
on 0 175 16
Sunday 0 175 16
that 0 175 16
Europe 0 175 16
faces 0 175 16
a 0 175 16
critical 0 175 16
fissure 0 175 16
between 0 175 16
nation 0 175 16
states 0 175 16
of 0 175 16
the 0 175 16
East 0 175 16
and 0 175 16
the 0 175 16
West, 0 175 16
which 0 175 16
he 0 175 16
called 0 175 16
an 0 175 16
"immigrant 0 175 16
zone, 0 175 16
a 0 175 16
mixed 0 175 16
population 0 175 16

that 0 175 16

a 1 175 16

different 1 175 16

As 0 175 17
the 0 175 17
West 0 175 17
wants 0 175 17
eastern 0 175 17
Europe 0 175 17
to 0 175 17
follow 0 175 17
its 0 175 17
lead, 0 175 17
an 0 175 17
increasingly 1 175 17
vicious 1 175 17
struggle 1 175 17
was 0 175 17
likely, 0 175 17
he 0 175 17
said, 0 175 17
alluding 0 175 17
to 0 175 17
a 0 175 17
plan 0 175 17

leaders 0 175 17
of 0 175 17

"Absurd 0 175 18
as 0 175 18
it 0 175 18
may 0 175 18
sound 0 175 18
the 1 175 18

we 1 175 18
face 1 175 18
comes 1 175 18
from 1 175 18

has 0 175 22
advocated 0 175 22

defining 0 175 23
moment 0 175 23
of 0 175 23

also 0 175 24

the 0 175 24

POWERFUL 0 175 26
ALLIES 0 175 26

Orban 0 175 27

Orban 0 175 30

he 0 175 30
anticipated 0 175 30
that 0 175 30
