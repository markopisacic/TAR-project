The 0 136 2
indoctrination 1 136 2
is 0 136 2
getting 0 136 2
so 1 136 2

that 0 136 2

The 0 136 4

that 0 136 4
“the 0 136 4

“When 0 136 5

it 0 136 7

the 0 136 7
rampant 1 136 7

That’s 0 136 8
just 0 136 8
the 0 136 8

a 0 136 10

said 0 136 13
the 0 136 13
top 0 136 13
three 0 136 13
reasons 0 136 13
that 0 136 13
parents 0 136 13
choose 0 136 13
homeschooling 0 136 13
are 0 136 13
a 0 136 13
desire 0 136 13
to 0 136 13
provide 0 136 13
religious 0 136 13
instruction 0 136 13
or 0 136 13
different 0 136 13

than 0 136 13
those 0 136 13
offered 0 136 13
in 0 136 13
public 0 136 13
schools; 0 136 13
dissatisfaction 0 136 13
with 0 136 13
the 0 136 13
academic 0 136 13
curriculum, 0 136 13
and 0 136 13
worries 0 136 13
about 0 136 13
the 0 136 13
school 0 136 13
environment. 0 136 13

Since 0 136 14
teachers 0 136 14

not 0 136 14
allowed 0 136 14
to 0 136 14

against 0 136 14

violence 1 136 14
often 0 136 14
perpetrated 0 136 14
at 0 136 14
schools 0 136 14
simply 0 136 14
because 0 136 14
they 0 136 14
are 0 136 14
gun 0 136 14
free 0 136 14
zones, 0 136 14
homeschooling 0 136 14
takes 0 136 14
care 0 136 14
of 0 136 14
that 0 136 14
problem. 0 136 14

“Most 0 136 15
parents 0 136 15
homeschool 0 136 15
for 0 136 15
more 0 136 15
than 0 136 15
one 0 136 15
reason,” 0 136 15
Ray 0 136 15
told 0 136 15
the 0 136 15
paper. 0 136 15

“But 0 136 16
when 0 136 16
we 0 136 16
ask 0 136 16
families 0 136 16
why 0 136 16
do 0 136 16
they 0 136 16
homeschool, 0 136 16
near 0 136 16
the 0 136 16
top 0 136 16
nowadays 0 136 16

environment 0 136 16

all 0 136 17
of 0 136 17
that.” 0 136 17

Indoctrination 1 136 18
means 0 136 18
to 0 136 18
teach 0 136 18
a 0 136 18
person 0 136 18
to 0 136 18
accept 0 136 18
a 0 136 18

uncritically. 0 136 18

It’s 1 136 19
the 1 136 19
very 1 136 19
reason 1 136 19
the 1 136 19
governments 1 136 19

critically 0 136 20
understand 0 136 20
that 0 136 20
hurting 0 136 20
people 0 136 20
and 0 136 20
taking 0 136 20
their 0 136 20
things 0 136 20
is 0 136 20
wrong 0 136 20
– 0 136 20
even 0 136 20
if 0 136 20
people 0 136 20
who 0 136 20
declare 0 136 20
themselves 0 136 20
government 0 136 20
is 0 136 20
the 0 136 20
one 0 136 20
doing 0 136 20
it. 0 136 20

Governments 1 136 21
are 1 136 21
nothing 1 136 21
more 1 136 21
than 1 136 21
a 1 136 21
handful 1 136 21
of 1 136 21
people 1 136 21
and 0 136 21
have 0 136 21
no 0 136 21
right 0 136 21
to 0 136 21
aggress 0 136 21
against 0 136 21
others. 0 136 21

But 0 136 22
humans 0 136 22
are 0 136 22
taught 0 136 22
at 0 136 22
a 0 136 22
