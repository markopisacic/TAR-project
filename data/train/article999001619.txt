It 0
is 0
welcome 0
that 0
finally 0
there 0
has 0
been 0
a 0
little 0
pushback, 0
including 0
from 0
leading 0
journalists, 0
to 0

Reporter 1
Luke 1
Harding’s 1
latest 1
article, 1
claiming 1
that 1
Donald 1
Trump’s 1
disgraced 1
former 1
campaign 1
manager 1
Paul 1
Manafort 1
secretly 1
visited 1
Assange 1
in 1
Ecuador’s 1
embassy 1
in 1
London 1
on 1
three 1
occasions, 1
is 1
so 1
full 1
of 1
holes 1
that 1
even 1
hardened 1
opponents 1
of 1
Assange 1
in 1
the 1
corporate 1
media 1
are 1
struggling 1
to 1
stand 1
by 1
it. 1

Faced 1
with 1
the 1
backlash, 1
the 1
Guardian 1
quickly 1
– 1
and 1
very 1
quietly 1
– 1
rowed 1
back 1
its 1
initial 1
certainty 1
that 1
its 1
story 1
was 1
based 1
on 1
verified 1
facts. 1

Instead, 1
it 1
amended 1
the 1
text, 1
without 1
acknowledging 1
it 1
had 1
done 1
so, 1
to 1
attribute 1
the 1
claims 1
to 1
unnamed, 1
and 1
uncheckable, 1
“sources”. 1

The 1
propaganda 1
function 1
of 1
the 1
piece 1
is 1
patent. 1

It 0
is 0
intended 0
to 0
provide 0
evidence 0
for 0
long-standing 0
allegations 0
that 0
Assange 0
conspired 0
with 0
Trump, 0
and 0
Trump’s 0
supposed 0
backers 0
in 0
the 0
Kremlin, 0
to 0
damage 0
Hillary 0
Clinton 0
during 0
the 0
2016 0
presidential 0
race. 0

The 1
Guardian’s 1
latest 1
story 1
provides 1
a 1
supposedly 1
stronger 1
foundation 1
for 1
an 1
existing 1
narrative: 1
that 1
Assange 1
and 1
Wikileaks 1
knowingly 1
published 1
emails 1
hacked 1
by 1
Russia 1
from 1
the 1
Democratic 1
party’s 1
servers. 1

In 1
truth, 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
public 1
evidence 1
that 1
the 1
emails 1
were 1
hacked, 1
or 1
that 1
Russia 1
was 1
involved. 1

Central 1
actors 1
have 1
suggested 1
instead 1
that 1
the 1
emails 1
were 1
leaked 1
from 1
within 1
the 1
Democratic 1
party. 1

Nonetheless, 0
this 0
unverified 0
allegation 0
has 0
been 0
aggressively 1
exploited 1
by 0
the 0
Democratic 0
leadership 0
because 0
it 0
shifts 0
attention 0
away 0
both 0
from 0
its 0
failure 0
to 0
mount 0
an 0
effective 0
electoral 0
challenge 0
to 0
Trump 0
and 0
from 0
the 0
damaging 0
contents 0
of 0
the 0
emails. 0

These 0
show 0
that 0
party 0
bureaucrats 0
sought 0
to 0
rig 0
the 0
primaries 0
to 0
make 0
sure 0
Clinton’s 0
challenger 0
for 0
the 0
Democratic 0
nomination, 0
Bernie 0
Sanders, 0
lost. 0

To 0
underscore 0
the 0
intended 0
effect 0
of 0
the 0
Guardian’s 0
new 0
claims, 0
Harding 0
even 0
throws 0
in 0
a 0
casual 0
and 0
unsubstantiated 0
reference 0
to 0
“Russians” 1
joining 0
Manafort 0
in 0
supposedly 0
meeting 0
Assange. 0

Manafort 0
has 0
denied 0
the 0
Guardian’s 0
claims, 0
while 0
Assange 0
has 0
threatened 0
to 0
sue 0
the 0
Guardian 0
for 0
libel. 0

‘Responsible 0
for 0
Trump’ 0

The 0
emotional 0
impact 0
of 0
the 0
Guardian 0
story 0
is 0
to 0
suggest 0
that 0
Assange 0
is 0
responsible 0
for 0
four 0
years 0
or 0
more 0
of 0
Trump 0
rule. 0

But 0
more 0
significantly, 0
it 0
bolsters 0
the 0
otherwise 0
risible 0
claim 0
that 0
Assange 0
is 0
not 0
a 0
publisher 0
– 0
and 0
thereby 0
entitled 0
to 0
the 0
protections 0
of 0
a 0
free 0
press, 0
as 0
enjoyed 0
by 0
the 0
Guardian 0
or 0
the 0
New 0
York 0
Times 0
– 0
but 0
the 1
head 1
of 1
an 1
organisation 1
engaged 1
in 1
espionage 1
for 1
a 1
foreign 1
power. 1

The 0
intention 0
is 0
to 0
deeply 0
discredit 0
Assange, 0
and 0
by 0
extension 0
the 0
Wikileaks 0
organisation, 0
in 0
the 0
eyes 0
of 0
right-thinking 0
liberals. 0

That, 0
in 0
turn, 0
will 0
make 0
it 0
much 0
easier 0
to 0
silence 0
Assange 0
and 0
the 0
vital 0
cause 0
he 0
represents: 0
the 0
use 0
of 0
new 0
media 0
to 0
hold 0
to 0
account 0
the 0
old, 0
corporate 0
media 0
and 0
political 0
elites 0
through 0
the 0
imposition 0
of 0
far 0
greater 0
transparency. 0

The 0
Guardian 0
story 0
will 0
prepare 0
public 0
opinion 0
for 0
the 0
moment 0
when 0
Ecuador’s 0
rightwing 0
government 0
under 0
President 0
Lenin 0
Moreno 0
forces 0
Assange 0
out 0
of 0
the 0
embassy, 0
having 0
already 0
withdrawn 0
most 0
of 0
his 0
rights 0
to 0
use 0
digital 0
media. 0

It 0
will 0
soften 0
opposition 0
when 0
the 0
UK 0
moves 0
to 0
arrest 0
Assange 0
on 0
self-serving 0
bail 0
violation 0
charges 0
and 0
extradites 0
him 0
to 0
the 0
US. 0

And 0
it 0
will 0
pave 0
the 0
way 0
for 0
the 0
US 0
legal 0
system 0
to 0
lock 0
Assange 0
up 0
for 0
a 0
very 0
long 0
time. 0

For 0
the 0
best 0
part 0
of 0
a 0
decade, 0
any 0
claims 0
by 0
Assange’s 0
supporters 0
that 0
avoiding 0
this 0
fate 0
was 0
the 0
reason 0
Assange 0
originally 0
sought 0
asylum 0
in 0
the 0
embassy 0
was 1
ridiculed 1
by 0
corporate 0
journalists, 0
not 0
least 0
at 0
the 0
Guardian. 0

Even 1
when 1
a 1
United 1
Nations 1
panel 1
of 1
experts 1
in 1
international 1
law 1
ruled 1
in 1
2016 1
that 1
Assange 1
was 1
being 1
arbitrarily 1
– 1
and 1
unlawfully 1
– 1
detained 1
by 1
the 1
UK, 1
Guardian 1
writers 1
led 1
efforts 1
to 1
discredit 1
the 1
UN 1
report. 1

See 0
here 0
and 0
here. 0

Now 0
Assange 0
and 0
his 0
supporters 0
have 0
been 0
proved 0
right 0
once 0
again. 0

An 0
administrative 0
error 0
this 0
month 0
revealed 0
that 0
the 0
US 0
justice 0
department 0
had 0
secretly 0
filed 0
criminal 0
charges 0
against 0
Assange. 0

Heavy 0
surveillance 0

The 1
problem 1
for 1
the 1
Guardian, 1
which 1
should 1
have 1
been 1
obvious 1
to 1
its 1
editors 1
from 1
the 1
outset, 1
is 1
that 1
any 1
visits 1
by 1
Manafort 1
would 1
be 1
easily 1
verifiable 1
without 1
relying 1
on 1
unnamed 1
“sources”. 1

Glenn 0
Greenwald 0
is 0
far 0
from 0
alone 0
in 0
noting 0
that 0
London 0
is 0
possibly 0
the 0
most 0
surveilled 0
city 0
in 0
the 0
world, 0
with 0
CCTV 0
cameras 0
everywhere. 0

The 0
environs 0
of 0
the 0
Ecuadorian 0
embassy 0
are 0
monitored 0
especially 0
heavily, 0
with 0
continuous 0
filming 0
by 0
the 0
UK 0
and 0
Ecuadorian 0
authorities 0
and 0
most 0
likely 0
by 0
the 0
US 0
and 0
other 0
actors 0
with 0
an 0
interest 0
in 0
Assange’s 0
fate. 0

The 0
idea 0
that 0
Manafort 0
or 0
“Russians” 1
could 0
have 0
wandered 0
into 0
the 0
embassy 0
to 0
meet 0
Assange 0
even 0
once 0
without 0
their 0
trail, 0
entry 0
and 0
meeting 0
being 0
intimately 0
scrutinised 0
and 0
recorded 0
is 0
simply 1
preposterous. 1

According 1
to 1
Greenwald: 1
“If 1
Paul 1
Manafort 1
… 1
visited 1
Assange 1
at 1
the 1
Embassy, 1
there 1
would 1
be 1
ample 1
amounts 1
of 1
video 1
and 1
other 1
photographic 1
proof 1
demonstrating 1
that 1
this 1
happened. 1

The 1
Guardian 1
provides 1
none 1
of 1
that.” 1

Former 0
British 0
ambassador 0
Craig 0
Murray 0
also 0
points 0
out 0
the 0
extensive 0
security 0
checks 0
insisted 0
on 0
by 0
the 0
embassy 0
to 0
which 0
any 0
visitor 0
to 0
Assange 0
must 0
submit. 0

Any 0
visits 0
by 0
Manafort 0
would 0
have 0
been 0
logged. 0

In 1
fact, 1
the 1
Guardian 1
obtained 1
the 1
embassy’s 1
logs 1
in 1
May, 1
and 1
has 1
never 1
made 1
any 1
mention 1
of 1
either 1
Manafort 1
or 1
“Russians” 1
being 1
identified 1
in 1
them. 1

It 1
did 1
not 1
refer 1
to 1
the 1
logs 1
in 1
its 1
latest 1
story. 1

Murray: 0

The 0
problem 0
with 0
this 1
latest 1
fabrication 1
is 0
that 0
[Ecuador’s 0
President] 0
Moreno 0
had 0
already 0
released 0
the 0
visitor 0
logs 0
to 0
the 0
Mueller 0
inquiry. 0

Neither 0
Manafort 0
nor 0
these 0
“Russians” 1
are 0
in 0
the 0
visitor 0
logs 0
… 0
What 0
possible 0
motive 0
would 0
the 0
Ecuadorean 0
government 0
have 0
for 0
facilitating 0
secret 0
unrecorded 0
visits 0
by 0
Paul 0
Manafort? 0

Furthermore 0
it 0
is 0
impossible 0
that 0
the 0
intelligence 0
agency 0
– 0
who 0
were 0
in 0
charge 0
of 0
the 0
security 0
– 0
would 0
not 0
know 0
the 0
identity 0
of 0
these 0
alleged 0
“Russians”. 1

No 1
fact-checking 1

It 1
is 1
worth 1
noting 1
it 1
should 1
be 1
vitally 1
important 1
for 1
a 1
serious 1
publication 1
like 1
the 1
Guardian 1
to 1
ensure 1
its 1
claims 1
are 1
unassailably 1
true 1
– 1
both 1
because 1
Assange’s 1
personal 1
fate 1
rests 1
on 1
their 1
veracity, 1
and 1
because, 1
even 1
more 1
importantly, 1
a 1
fundamental 1
right, 1
the 1
freedom 1
of 1
the 1
press, 1
is 1
at 1
stake. 1

Given 1
this, 1
one 1
would 1
have 1
expected 1
the 1
Guardian’s 1
editors 1
to 1
have 1
insisted 1
on 1
the 1
most 1
stringent 1
checks 1
imaginable 1
before 1
going 1
to 1
press 1
with 1
Harding’s 1
story. 1

At 1
a 1
very 1
minimum, 1
they 1
should 1
have 1
sought 1
out 1
a 1
response 1
from 1
Assange 1
and 1
Manafort 1
before 1
publication. 1

Neither 1
precaution 1
was 1
taken. 1

I 1
worked 1
for 1
the 1
Guardian 1
for 1
a 1
number 1
of 1
years, 1
and 1
know 1
well 1
the 1
layers 1
of 1
checks 1
that 1
any 1
highly 1
sensitive 1
story 1
has 1
to 1
go 1
through 1
before 1
publication. 1

In 1
that 1
lengthy 1
process, 1
a 1
variety 1
of 1
commissioning 1
editors, 1
lawyers, 1
backbench 1
editors 1
and 1
the 1
editor 1
herself, 1
Kath 1
Viner, 1
would 1
normally 1
insist 1
on 1
cuts 1
to 1
anything 1
that 1
could 1
not 1
be 1
rigorously 1
defended 1
and 1
corroborated. 1

And 1
yet 1
this 1
piece 1
seems 1
to 1
have 1
been 1
casually 1
waved 1
through, 1
given 1
a 1
green 1
light 1
even 1
though 1
its 1
profound 1
shortcomings 1
were 1
evident 1
to 1
a 1
range 1
of 1
well-placed 1
analysts 1
and 1
journalists 1
from 1
the 1
outset. 1

That 0
at 0
the 0
very 0
least 0
hints 0
that 0
the 0
Guardian 0
thought 0
they 0
had 0
“insurance” 0
on 0
this 0
story. 0

And 0
the 0
only 0
people 0
who 0
could 0
have 0
promised 0
that 0
kind 0
of 0
insurance 0
are 0
the 0
security 0
and 0
intelligence 0
services 0
– 0
presumably 0
of 0
Britain, 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
and 0
/ 0
or 0
Ecuador. 0

It 1
appears 1
the 1
Guardian 1
has 1
simply 1
taken 1
this 1
story, 1
provided 1
by 1
spooks, 1
at 1
face 1
value. 1

Even 1
if 1
it 1
later 1
turns 1
out 1
that 1
Manafort 1
did 1
visit 1
Assange, 1
the 1
Guardian 1
clearly 1
had 1
no 1
compelling 1
evidence 1
for 1
its 1
claims 1
when 1
it 1
published 1
them. 1

That 1
is 1
profoundly 1
irresponsible 1
journalism 1
– 1
fake 1
news 1
– 1
that 1
should 1
be 1
of 1
the 1
gravest 1
concern 1
to 1
readers. 1

A 0
pattern, 0
not 0
an 0
aberration 0

Despite 1
all 1
this, 1
even 1
analysts 1
critical 1
of 1
the 1
Guardian’s 1
behaviour 1
have 1
shown 1
a 1
glaring 1
failure 1
to 1
understand 1
that 1
its 1
latest 1
coverage 1
represents 1
not 1
an 1
aberration 1
by 1
the 1
paper 1
but 1
decisively 1
fits 1
with 1
a 1
pattern. 1

Glenn 0
Greenwald, 0
who 0
once 0
had 0
an 0
influential 0
column 0
in 0
the 0
Guardian 0
until 0
an 0
apparent, 0
though 0
unacknowledged, 0
falling 0
out 0
with 0
his 0
employer 0
over 0
the 0
Edward 0
Snowden 0
revelations, 0
wrote 0
a 0
series 0
of 0
baffling 1
observations 1
about 0
the 0
Guardian’s 0
latest 0
story. 0

First, 0
he 0
suggested 0
it 0
was 0
simply 0
evidence 0
of 0
the 0
Guardian’s 0
long-standing 1
(and 1
well-documented) 1
hostility 1
towards 1
Assange. 1

“The 1
Guardian, 1
an 1
otherwise 1
solid 1
and 1
reliable 1
paper, 1
has 1
such 1
a 1
pervasive 1
and 1
unprofessionally 1
personal 1
hatred 1
for 1
Julian 1
Assange 1
that 1
it 1
has 1
frequently 1
dispensed 1
with 1
all 1
journalistic 1
standards 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
malign 1
him.” 1

It 1
was 1
also 1
apparently 1
evidence 1
of 1
the 1
paper’s 1
clickbait 1
tendencies: 1

“They 1
[Guardian 1
editors] 1
knew 1
that 1
publishing 1
this 1
story 1
would 1
cause 1
partisan 1
warriors 1
to 1
excitedly 1
spread 1
the 1
story, 1
and 1
that 1
cable 1
news 1
outlets 1
would 1
hyperventilate 1
over 1
it, 1
and 1
that 1
they’d 1
reap 1
the 1
rewards 1
regardless 1
of 1
whether 1
the 1
story 1
turned 1
out 1
to 1
be 1
true 1
or 1
false.” 1

And 0
finally, 0
in 0
a 1
bizarre 1
tweet, 1
Greenwald 0
opined, 0
“I 0
hope 0
the 0
story 0
[maligning 0
Assange] 0
turns 0
out 0
true” 0
– 0
apparently 1
because 1
maintenance 1
of 1
the 1
Guardian’s 1
reputation 1
is 1
more 1
important 1
than 1
Assange’s 1
fate 1
and 1
the 1
right 1
of 1
journalists 1
to 1
dig 1
up 1
embarrassing 1
secrets 1
without 1
fear 1
of 1
being 1
imprisoned. 1

I 0
think 0
the 0
Guardian 0
is 0
an 0
important 0
paper 0
with 0
great 0
journalists. 0

I 0
hope 0
the 0
story 0
turns 0
out 0
true. 0

But 0
the 0
skepticism 0
over 0
this 0
story 0
is 0
very 0
widespread, 0
including 0
among 0
Assange's 1
most 1
devoted 1
haters, 1
because 0
it's 0
so 0
sketchy. 0

If 0
Manafort 0
went 0
there, 0
there's 0
video. 0

Let's 0
see 0
it. 0

Deeper 0
malaise 0

What 0
this 0
misses 0
is 0
that 0
the 0
Guardian’s 0
attacks 0
on 0
Assange 0
are 0
not 0
exceptional 0
or 0
motivated 0
solely 0
by 0
personal 0
animosity. 0

They 0
are 0
entirely 0
predictable 0
and 0
systematic. 0

Rather 1
than 1
being 1
the 1
reason 1
for 1
the 1
Guardian 1
violating 1
basic 1
journalistic 1
standards 1
and 1
ethics, 1
the 1
paper’s 1
hatred 1
of 1

is 1
a 1
symptom 1
of 1
a 1
deeper 1
malaise 1
in 1
the 1
Guardian 1
and 1
the 1
wider 1
corporate 1
media. 1

Even 1
aside 1
from 1
its 1
decade-long 1
campaign 1
against 1
Assange, 1
the 1
Guardian 1
is 1
far 1
from 1
“solid 1
and 1
reliable”, 1
as 1
Greenwald 1
claims. 1

It 1
has 1
been 1
at 1
the 1
forefront 1
of 1
the 1
relentless, 1
and 1
unhinged, 1
attacks 1
on 1
Labour 1
leader 1
Jeremy 1
Corbyn 1
for 1
prioritising 1
the 1
rights 1
of 1
Palestinians 1
over 1
Israel’s 1
right 1
to 1
continue 1
its 1
belligerent 1
occupation. 1

Over 1
the 1
past 1
three 1
years, 1
the 1
Guardian 1
has 1
injected 1
credibility 1
into 1
the 1
Israel 1
lobby’s 1
desperate 1
efforts 1
to 1
tar 1
Corbyn 1
as 1
an 1
anti-semite. 1

Similarly, 1
the 1
Guardian 1
worked 1
tirelessly 1
to 1
promote 1
Clinton 1
and 1
undermine 1
Sanders 1
in 1
the 1
2016 1
Democratic 1
nomination 1
process 1
– 1
another 1
reason 1
the 1
paper 1
has 1
been 1
so 1
assiduous 1
in 1
promoting 1
the 1
idea 1
that 1
Assange, 1
aided 1
by 1
Russia, 1
was 1
determined 1
to 1
promote 1
Trump 1
over 1
Clinton 1
for 1
the 1
presidency. 1

The 1
Guardian’s 1
coverage 1
of 1
Latin 1
America, 1
especially 1
of 1
populist 1
leftwing 1
governments 1
that 1
have 1
rebelled 1
against 1
traditional 1
and 1
oppressive 1
US 1
hegemony 1
in 1
the 1
region, 1
has 1
long 1
grated 1
with 1
analysts 1
and 1
experts. 1

Its 1
especial 1
venom 1
has 1
been 1
reserved 1
for 1
leftwing 1
figures 1
like 1
Venezuela’s 1
Hugo 1
Chavez, 1
democratically 1
elected 1
but 1
official 1
enemies 1
of 1
the 1
US, 1
rather 1
than 1
the 1
region’s 1
rightwing 1
authoritarians 1
beloved 1
of 1
Washington. 1

The 1
Guardian 1
has 1
been 1
vocal 1
in 1
the 1
so-called 1
“fake 1
news” 1
hysteria, 1
decrying 1
the 1
influence 1
of 1
social 1
media, 1
the 1
only 1
place 1
where 1
leftwing 1
dissidents 1
have 1
managed 1
to 1
find 1
a 1
small 1
foothold 1
to 1
promote 1
their 1
politics 1
and 1
counter 1
the 1
corporate 1
media 1
narrative. 1

The 1
Guardian 1
has 1
painted 1
social 1
media 1
chiefly 1
as 1
a 1
platform 1
overrun 1
by 1
Russian 1
trolls, 1
arguing 1
that 1
this 1
should 1
justify 1
ever-tighter 1
restrictions 1
that 1
have 1
so 1
far 1
curbed 1
critical 1
voices 1
of 1
the 1
dissident 1
left 1
more 1
than 1
the 1
right. 1

Heroes 0
of 0
the 0
neoliberal 0
order 0

Equally, 1
the 1
Guardian 1
has 1
made 1
clear 1
who 1
its 1
true 1
heroes 1
are. 1

Certainly 1
not 1
Corbyn 1
or 1
Assange, 1
who 1
threaten 1
to 1
disrupt 1
the 1
entrenched 1
neoliberal 1
order 1
that 1
is 1
hurtling 1
us 1
towards 1
climate 1
breakdown 1
and 1
economic 1
collapse. 1

Its 1
pages, 1
however, 1
are 1
readily 1
available 1
to 1
the 1
latest 1
effort 1
to 1
prop 1
up 1
the 1
status 1
quo 1
from 1
Tony 1
Blair, 1
the 1
man 1
who 1
led 1
Britain, 1
on 1
false 1
pretences, 1
into 1
the 1
largest 1
crime 1
against 1
humanity 1
in 1
living 1
memory 1
– 1
the 1
attack 1
on 1
Iraq. 1

That 1
“humanitarian 1
intervention” 1
cost 1
the 1
lives 1
of 1
many 1
hundreds 1
of 1
thousands 1
of 1
Iraqis 1
and 1
created 1
a 1
vacuum 1
that 1
destabilised 1
much 1
of 1
the 1
Middle 1
East, 1
sucked 1
in 1
Islamic 1
jihadists 1
like 1
al-Qaeda 1
and 1
ISIS, 1
and 1
contributed 1
to 1
the 1
migrant 1
crisis 1
in 1
Europe 1
that 1
has 1
fuelled 1
the 1
resurgence 1
of 1
the 1
far-right. 1

None 1
of 1
that 1
is 1
discussed 1
in 1
the 1
Guardian 1
or 1
considered 1
grounds 1
for 1
disqualifying 1
Blair 1
as 1
an 1
arbiter 1
of 1
what 1
is 1
good 1
for 1
Britain 1
and 1
the 1
world’s 1
future. 1

The 1
Guardian 1
also 1
has 1
an 1
especial 1
soft 1
spot 1
for 1
blogger 1
Elliot 1
Higgins, 1
who, 1
aided 1
by 1
the 1
Guardian, 1
has 1
shot 1
to 1
unlikely 1
prominence 1
as 1
a 1
self-styled 1
“weapons 1
expert”. 1

Like 1
Luke 1
Harding, 1
Higgins 1
invariably 1
seems 1
ready 1
to 1
echo 1
whatever 1
the 1
British 1
and 1
American 1
security 1
services 1
need 1
verifying 1
“independently”. 1

Higgins 1
and 1
his 1
well-staffed 1
website 1
Bellingcat 1
have 1
taken 1
on 1
for 1
themselves 1
the 1
role 1
of 1
arbiters 1
of 1
truth 1
on 1
many 1
foreign 1
affairs 1
issues, 1
taking 1
a 1
prominent 1
role 1
in 1
advocating 1
for 1
narratives 1
that 1
promote 1
US 1
and 1
NATO 1
hegemony 1
while 1
demonising 1
Russia, 1
especially 1
in 1
highly 1
contested 1
arenas 1
such 1
as 1
Syria. 1

That 0
clear 0
partisanship 0
should 0
be 0
no 0
surprise, 0
given 0
that 0
Higgins 0
now 0
enjoys 0
an 0
“academic” 0
position 0
at, 0
and 0
funding 0
from, 0
the 0
Atlantic 0
Council, 0
a 1
high-level, 1
Washington-based 1
think-tank 1
founded 1
to 1
drum 1
up 1
support 1
for 1
NATO 1
and 1
justify 1
its 1
imperialist 1
agenda. 1

Improbably, 1
the 1
Guardian 1
has 1
adopted 1
Higgins 1
as 1
the 1
poster-boy 1
for 1
a 1
supposed 1
citizen 1
journalism 1
it 1
has 1
sought 1
to 1
undermine 1
as 1
“fake 1
news” 1
whenever 1
it 1
occurs 1
on 1
social 1
media 1
without 1
the 1
endorsement 1
of 1
state-backed 1
organisations. 1

The 1
truth 1
is 1
that 1
the 1
Guardian 1
has 1
not 1
erred 1
in 1
this 1
latest 1
story 1
attacking 1
Assange, 1
or 1
in 1
its 1
much 1
longer-running 1
campaign 1
to 1
vilify 1
him. 1

With 1
this 1
story, 1
it 1
has 1
done 1
what 1
it 1
regularly 1
does 1
when 1
supposedly 1
vital 1
western 1
foreign 1
policy 1
interests 1
are 1
at 1
stake 1
– 1
it 1
simply 1
regurgitates 1
an 1
elite-serving, 1
western 1
narrative. 1

Its 1
job 1
is 1
to 1
shore 1
up 1
a 1
consensus 1
on 1
the 1
left 1
for 1
attacks 1
on 1
leading 1
threats 1
to 1
the 1
existing, 1
neoliberal 1
order: 1

they 0

like 0
Hugo 0
Chavez 0
who 0
threatened 0
to 0
overturn 0
a 1
damaging 1
and 1
exploitative 1
US 1
dominance 1
of 1
“America’s 1
backyard”; 1
or 0
social 0

dissidents 0

have 0
started 0

chip 0
away 0
at 0
the 1
elite-friendly 1
narratives 1
of 1
corporate 1
media, 1
including 0
the 0
Guardian. 0

The 1
Guardian 1
did 1
not 1
make 1
a 1
mistake 1
in 1
vilifying 1
Assange 1
without 1
a 1
shred 1
of 1

It 1

what 1
it 1
is 1
designed 1
to 1
do. 1
