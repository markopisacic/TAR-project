to 0
those 0
reported 0
by 0

The 0
unnamed 0
worker 0
reported, 0
“subtle 0
and 0
vague, 0
but 0
abnormal, 0
sensations 0
of 0
sound 0
and 0
pressure.” 0

The 0
government 0

experienced 0

symptoms 0
from 0
late 0
2017 0
until 0
April 0
of 0
2018, 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
U.S. 0

“The 0
employee 0
was 0
sent 0
to 0

for 0
further 0
evaluation. 0

On 0
May 0

the 0

learned 0
that 0
the 0

findings 0

(MTBI),” 0
Jinnie 0
Lee, 0
U.S. 0
Embassy 0
spokesperson 0
in 0
Beijing, 0
told 0

by 0

“The 0
Chinese 0

has 0
assured 0
us 0
they 0
are 0
also 0
investigating 0

But 0
this 0
isn’t 0
the 0
first 0
time 0
a 0
sound 0
weapon 0
has 0
been 0
used 0
on 0
American 0
diplomats. 0

Cuba 0
has 0
been 0
accused 0
of 0
using 0
a 0
similar 0
device 0
to 0
cause 0
brain 0
trauma 0
in 0
Americans 0
at 0
the 0
embassy 0
in 0
Havana. 0

It 0
all 0
started 0
in 0
the 0
fall 0
of 0
2016. 0

Several 0
of 0
the 0
affected 0
diplomats 0
were 0
recent 0
arrivals 0
at 0
the 0
embassy, 0
which 0
reopened 0

Obama’s 0
reestablishment 0
of 0

Cuba. 0

The 0
Daily 0
Mail 0
reported 0
that 0
one 0
diplomat 0
described 0
being 0
jolted 0
awake 0
in 0
a 0
Havana 0
hotel 0
room 0
by 0
a 0
grinding, 0
blaring 0
cacophony. 0

When 0
he 0
moved 0
a 0
few 0
feet 0
across 0
the 0
room, 0
the 0
noise 0
stopped. 0

When 0
he 0
got 0
back 0
into 0
bed, 0
the 0
agonizing 1
sound 0
hit 0
him 0
again; 0
as 0
if, 0
he 0
told 0
doctors, 0
he 0
had 0
walked 0
through 0
some 0
invisible 0
wall 0
cutting 0
straight 0
down 0
the 0
middle 0
of 0
his 0
room. 0

Whether 0
they 0
heard 0
anything 0
or 0
not, 0
the 0
consequences 0
have 0
been 0
unmistakable 0
— 0
symptoms 0
ranging 0
from 0
nosebleeds, 0
nausea, 0
dizziness 0
and 0
severe 0
headaches 0
to 0
mild 0
brain 0

Oddly, 0
as 0
soon 0
as 0
some 0
of 0
the 0
victims 0
left 0
Cuba, 0
they 0
stopped 0
hearing 0
noises. 0

“If 0

they 0

through 0
the 0

to 0
an 0

operated 0
outside 0
