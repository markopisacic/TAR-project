in 0 231 11
a 0 231 11

a 0 231 11
grinding, 0 231 11
blaring 0 231 11
cacophony. 0 231 11

When 0 231 12
he 0 231 12
moved 0 231 12
a 0 231 12
few 0 231 12
feet 0 231 12

the 0 231 12

the 0 231 13
agonizing 1 231 13
sound 0 231 13
hit 0 231 13
him 0 231 13
again; 0 231 13
as 0 231 13
if, 0 231 13
he 0 231 13
told 0 231 13
doctors, 0 231 13
he 0 231 13

Whether 0 231 14

the 0 231 14
consequences 0 231 14
have 0 231 14
been 0 231 14

from 0 231 14
nosebleeds, 0 231 14
