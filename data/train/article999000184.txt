Our 0
New 0
Muslim 0
Representatives 0

As 0
expected, 0
two 0
Muslim 0
women, 0
Rashida 0
Tlaib 0
in 0
Michigan 0
and 0
Ilhan 0
Omar 0
in 0
Minnesota, 0
have 1
been 1
overwhelmingly 1
elected 1
to 0
Congress. 0

The 0
establishment 0
media 0
will 0
celebrate 0
these 0
victories 0
as 0
triumphs 1
of 1
America’s 1
“diversity”; 1
unfortunately, 1
in 1
reality 1
neither 1
one 1
is 1
worth 1
celebrating. 1

Tlaib 0
is 0
a 0
vociferous 0
foe 0
of 0
Israel. 0

With 0
the 0
Democrats 0
now 0
regaining 0
control 0
of 0
the 0
House, 0
Tlaib 0
is 0
likely 0
to 0
be 0
an 0
energetic 0
proponent 0
of 0
the 0
new 0
majority’s 0
vendetta 1
against 1
the 0
Middle 0
East’s 0
only 0
democracy. 0

The 0
House 0
is 0
likely 0
to 0
do 0
all 0
it 0
can 0
to 0
roll 0
back 0
President 0
Trump’s 0
pro-Israel 0
polices, 0
with 0
Tlaib 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
Omar 0
as 0
becoming 0
the 0
public 0
faces 0
of 0
the 0
effort. 0

According 0
to 0
the 0
JTA, 0
when 0
Tlaib 0
was 0
asked 0
if 0
she 0
would 0
vote 0
against 0
military 0
aid 0
to 0
Israel, 0
Tlaib 0
responded: 0
“Absolutely, 0
if 0
it 0
has 0
something 0
to 0
do 0
with 0
inequality 0
and 0
not 0
access 0
to 0
people 0
having 0
justice. 0

For 1
me, 1
U.S. 1
aid 1
should 1
be 1
leverage. 1

I 1
will 1
be 1
using 1
my 1
position 1
in 1
Congress 1
so 1
that 1
no 1
country, 1
not 1
one, 1
should 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
get 1
aid 1
from 1
the 1
U.S. 1
when 1
they 1
still 1
promote 1
that 1
kind 1
of 1
injustice.” 1

What 0
kind 0
of 0
injustice? 0

Tlaib, 1
of 1
course, 1
had 1
nothing 1
to 1
say 1
about 1
the 1
genocidal 1
incitement 1
against 1
Jews 1
and 1
Israel 1
that 1
regularly 1
features 1
on 1
Palestinian 1
television. 1

She 0
did 0
say, 0
however, 0
that 0
she 0
favors 0
a 0
one-state, 0
not 0
two-state, 0
“solution” 0
to 0
the 0
Israeli-Palestinian 0
conflict: 0
“One 0
state. 0

It 0
has 0
to 0
be 0
one 0
state. 0

Separate 0
but 0
equal 0
does 0
not 0
work. 0

I’m 0
only 0
42 0
years 0
old 0
but 0
my 0
teachers 0
were 0
of 0
that 0
generation 0
that 0
marched 0
with 0
Martin 0
Luther 0
King. 0

This 0
whole 0
idea 0
of 0
a 0
two-state 0
solution, 0
it 1
doesn’t 1
work.” 1

Indeed 0
it 0
doesn’t. 0

A 0
Palestinian 0
state 0
would 0
be 0
a 0
new 0
base 0
for 0
renewed 0
jihad 0
attacks 0
against 0
Israel. 0

But 0
a 0
“one-state 0
solution” 0
would 0
be 0
even 0
worse, 0
unless 0
that 0
state 0
is 0
the 0
current 0
State 0
of 0
Israel, 0
but 0
that 0
is 0
not 0
the 0
one 0
state 0
Tlaib 0
has 0
in 0
mind. 0

She 0
is 0
calling 0
for 0
an 0
Israeli/Palestinian 0
state 0
that 0
would 0
not 0
be 0
a 0
Jewish 0
State 0
or 0
a 0
homeland 0
for 0
the 0
Jewish 0
people, 0
but 0
a 0
federation 0
in 0
which 0
Palestinians 0
would 0
soon 0
overwhelm 0
Jews 0
demographically. 0

Progressive 0
denial 0
of 0
their 0
rights 0
would 0
soon 0
follow: 0
as 0
I 0
show 0
in 0
my 0
book 0
The 0
History 0
of 0
Jihad 0
From 0
Muhammad 0
to 0
ISIS, 0
there 0
has 0
never 0
been 0
a 0
majority 0
Muslim 0
nation 0
in 0
which 0
Jews 0
enjoyed 0
equality 0
of 0
rights 0
with 0
Muslims. 0

Tlaib’s 0
unitary 0
state 0
would 0
be 0
no 0
different. 0

The 0
hijabed 0
(and 0
therefore 0
pro-Sharia) 0
Ilhan 0
Omar, 0
meanwhile, 0
is 1
even 1
more 1
hateful 1
than 1
Tlaib. 1

According 0
to 0
the 0
Daily 0
Wire, 0
in 0
2012 0
Omar 0
tweeted: 0
“Israel 0
has 0
hypnotized 1
the 0
world, 0
may 0
Allah 0
awaken 0
the 0
people 0
and 0
help 0
them 0
see 0
the 1
evil 1
doings 1
of 1
Israel. 1

#Gaza 0
#Palestine 0
#Israel.” 0
Challenged 0
about 0
this 0
tweet 0
much 0
more 0
recently, 0
she 1
doubled 1
down 1
and 1
attacked 1
the 0
man 0
who 0
called 0
attention 0
to 0
the 0
tweet: 0
“Drawing 0
attention 0
to 0
the 0
apartheid 0
Israeli 0
regime 0
is 0
far 0
from 0
hating 0
Jews. 0

You 1
are 1
a 1
hateful 1
sad 1
man, 1
I 1
pray 1
to 1
Allah 1
you 1
get 1
the 1
help 1
you 1
need 1
and 1
find 1
happiness.” 1

There 1
is 1
much, 1
much 1
worse 1
about 1
Omar. 1

David 0
Steinberg 0
of 0
PJ 0
Media 0
has 0
done 0
extraordinary 1
work 1
in 0
shedding 0
light 0
on 0
aspects 0
of 0
Omar’s 0
record 0
that 0
the 0
establishment 0
media 0
has 0
steadfastly 1
ignored. 1

Steinberg 0
reports 0
that 0
Omar 0
has 0
“faced 0
allegations 0
-- 0
soon 0
backed 0
by 0
a 0
remarkable 0
amount 0
of 0
evidence 0
-- 0
that 0
she 0
had 0
married 0
her 0
own 0
brother 0
in 0
2009, 0
and 0
was 0
still 0
legally 0
his 0
wife. 0

They 0
officially 0
divorced 0
in 0
December 0
2017. 0

The 0
motivation 0
for 0
the 0
marriage 0
remains 0
unclear. 0

However, 0
the 0
totality 0
of 0
the 0
evidence 0
points 0
to 0
possible 0
immigration 0
fraud 0
and 0
student 0
loan 0
fraud.” 0
What’s 0
more, 0
she 0
swore 0
to 0
apparent 0
falsehoods 0
in 0
court. 0

But 0
Leftists 0
rarely 0
have 0
to 0
answer 0
for 0
their 0
corruption, 0
and 0
in 0
a 0
Democrat 0
House, 0
Omar 0
will 0
much 0
more 0
likely 0
be 0
celebrated 0
than 0
investigated. 0

She 0
and 0
Tlaib 0
will 0
enjoy 0
establishment 0
media 0
accolades 0
as 0
they 0
pursue 0
their 0
hard-Left, 0
anti-American, 0
anti-Israel 0
agenda. 0

Their 0
presence 0
in 0
the 0
House 0
of 0
Representatives 0
may 0
be 0
evidence 0
of 0
“diversity,” 0
but 0
it 0
is 0
also 0
a 0
disquieting 0
sign 0
of 0
the 0
continued 0
dominance 0
of 0
identity 0
politics, 0
and 0
the 1
increasing 1
balkanization 1
of 0
the 0
American 0
body 0
politic. 0

Forthrightly 1
pro-America, 1
pro-Israel 1
candidates 1
would 1
stand 1
little 1
to 1
no 1
chance 1
in 1
either 1
of 1
their 1
districts. 1

And 1
that 1
is 1
indicative 1
of 1
a 1
much 1
larger 1
problem. 1
