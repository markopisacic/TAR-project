How 0
fortuitous 0
and 0
revelatory 0
that 0
McCarrick, 0

would 0
divulge 0

role 0
in 0

to 0
elect 0
Jorge 0
Bergoglio 0

met 0

to 0

him 0

In 0
light 0
of 0
the 0
McCarrick 0
scandal, 0
the 0
conversation 0
takes 0
on 0
new 0
meaning... 0

McCarrick 0
described 0
the 0
conversation 0
with 0
the 0
Influential 1
Roman: 0

“Before 0
we 0
went 0
into 0
the 0
General 0
Congregation, 0
a 0
very 0
interesting 0
and 0
influential 1
Italian 0
gentleman 0
came 0
to 0
see 0
me 0
at 0
the 0
Seminary 0
(where 0
else?) 0

where 0
I 0
was 0
staying. 0

We 0
sat 0
down 0
and 0
he’s 0
a 0
very 0
brilliant 0
man, 0
very 0
influential 1
in 0
Rome 0
and 0
said 0
he 0
had 0
a 0
favor 0
to 0
ask 0
of 0
me 0
back 0
home 0
in 0
the 0
U.S., 0
but 0
then 0
he 0
said:” 0

Influential 1
Roman: 0
What 0
about 0
Bergoglio? 0

Molester 1
McCarrick: 0
I 0
was 0
surprised 0
and 0
said, 0
What 0
about 0
Bergoglio? 0

Influential 1
Roman: 0
Does 0
he 0
have 0
a 0
chance? 0

Molester 1
McCarrick: 0
I 0
don’t 0
think 0
so. 0

No 0
one 0
has 0
mentioned 0
his 0
name. 0

He 0
isn’t 0
on 0
anyone’s 0
mind. 0

Influential 1
Roman: 0
He 0
could 0
do 0
it 0
you 0
know. 0

Molester 1
McCarrick: 0
What 0
could 0
he 0
do? 0

Influential 1
Roman: 0
He 0
could 0
reform 0
the 0
Church. 0

If 0
you 0
gave 0
him 0
5 0
years, 0
he 0
could 0
get 0
us 0
back 0
on 0
target. 0

He’s 0
76. 0

If 0
he 0
had 0
5 0
years—the 0
Lord 0
working 0
through 0
him, 0
he 0
could 0
make 0
the 0
Church 0
over 0
again. 0

Molester 1
McCarrick: 0
That’s 0
interesting. 0

Influential 1
Roman: 0
I 0
know 0
you 0
are 0
his 0
friend. 0

Molester 1
McCarrick: 0
I 0
hope 0
I 0
am. 0

Influential 1
Roman: 0
Talk 0
him 0
up. 0

Molester 1
McCarrick'll 0
vouch 0
for 0
ya, 0
Francis! 0

#bromance 0

And 0
talk 0
him 0
up, 0
McCarrick 0
the 0
Molester 1
did! 0

Oh, 0
the 0
irony! 0

That 0
the 1
most 1
prolific 1
serial 1
predator 1
Cardinal 0
would 0
divulge 0
the 0
pre-Conclave 0
Bergoglio 0
plot 0
to 0
“reform 1
the 1
Church.” 1
Now 0
we 0
know 0
what 0
“reform 1
the 1
Church” 1
looks 0
like 0
in 0
the 0
Bergoglian 0
papacy. 0

Yes, 0
the 0
clever 0
and 0
tyrannical 1
Bergoglio, 0
through 0
his 0
manipulation 0
of 0
synods, 0
footnotes, 0
exhortations, 0
personal 0
phone 0
calls, 0
airplane 0
pressers, 0
and 0
correspondence 0
has 0
nearly 0
completed 0
his 0
task 0
of 0
modernizing 0
the 0
Roman 0
Catholic 0
Church 0
in 0
the 0
past 0
5 0
years. 0

The 0
rallying 0
cry 0
for 0
his 0
homosexual 0
modern 0
agenda 0
was 0
sounded 0
in 0
his 0
July 0
29, 0
2013 0
airplane 0
presser. 0

Who 0
am 0
I 0
to 0
judge 0
set 0
the 0
tone 0
for 0
merciful 0
embrace 0
of 0
homosexual 0
priests. 0

After 0
5 0
long 0
years, 0
his 0
unrelenting 0
mercy 0
mantra 0
seemingly 0
extends 0
only 0
to 0
homosexual 0
clerics, 0
not 0
to 0
the 0
laity 0
or 0
clergy 0
victims 0
who 0
protest 0
the 0
cover 0
ups 0
by 0
prelates. 0

Francis’ 0
wink 0
and 0
nod 0
to 0
the 0
homosexual 0
lifestyle 0
landed 0
him 0
on 0
the 0
cover 0
of 0
the 0
Advocate, 0
the 0
gay 0
magazine, 0
as 0
its 0
Man 0
of 0
the 0
Year. 0

He 0
lapped 0
up 0
the 0
accolades 0
from 0
the 0
secular 0
culture 0
and 0
main 0
stream 0
media. 0

Yet, 0
fame 0
is 0
and 0
predation 1
is 1
unrelenting, 1
even 0
for 0
Popes. 0

In 0
the 0
words 0
of 0
Queen 0
Elizabeth, 0
this 0
year 0
has 0
been 0
annus 0
horribilis 0
for 0
Francis. 0

Excuse 0
the 0
gay 0
slang 0
pun 0
but, 0
the 0
chickens 0
have 0
come 0
home 0
to 0
roost. 0

The 0
cascading 0
revelations 0
of 0
papal 0
sex 0
scandals 0
are 0
toppling 0
the 0
barque 0
of 0
Peter. 0

Will 0
Catholic 0
laity 0
pay 0
attention 0
and 0
take 0
action? 0

The 0
McCarrick 0
scandal 0
created 0
an 0
earthquake 1
in 0
the 0
Catholic 0
Church 0
with 0
aftershocks 0
that 0
will 0
last 0
for 0
years. 0

The 0
timing 0
is 0
eerily 1
propitious 0
and 0
providential 0
based 0
on 0
the 0
5 0
year 0
deadline. 0

Will 0
the 0
laity 0
step 0
up 0
and 0
reclaim 0
our 0
hijacked 1
Catholic 0
Church? 0

This 0
critical 0
time 0
in 0
the 0
history 0
of 0
the 0
Catholic 0
Church 0
demands 0
that 0
the 0
laity 0
step 0
forward 0
to 0
protect 0
the 0
Church, 0
its 0
children 0
and 0
seminarians 0
from 0
predators. 0

We 0
must 0
close 0
ranks 0
before 0
another 0
precious 0
child 0
is 0
exploited, 0
a 0
holy 0
seminarian 0
is 0
violated, 0
or 0
another 0
homosexual 0
orgy 1
is 0
covered 0
up 0
at 0
the 0
Vatican. 0

The 0
first 0
order 0
of 0
business 0
is 0
to 0
scuttle 0
the 0
upcoming 0
October 0
Synod 0
on 0
Young 0
People, 0
the 0
Faith, 0
and 0
Vocational 0
Discernment. 0

Remember 0
that 0
influential 1
Roman 0
gentleman 0
friend 0
of 0
McCarrick 0
who 0
said 0
that 0
Bergoglio 0
could 0
reform 0
the 0
Church 0
in 0
5 0
years? 0

Bergoglio’s 0
upcoming 0
Synod 0
on 0
Young 0
People 0
will 0
serve 0
as 0
the 0
culminating 0
vehicle 0
for 0
the 0
5 0
year 0
modernist 0
reform 0
of 0
the 0
St. 1
Gallen 1
Mafia. 1

This 0
Synod 0
is 0
designed 0
to 0
exploit 0
the 0
youth, 0
like 0
they’ve 0
been 0
doing 0
for 0
the 0
last 0
60 0
years. 0

If 0
it 0
weren’t 0
so 0
infuriating, 1
it 0
would 0
be 0
laughable 0
that 0
following 0
the 0
McCarrick 0
scandal 0
of 0
sexual 0
predation 0
of 0
young 0
males 0
and 0
seminarians, 0
by 0
a 0
Cardinal, 0
and 0
covered 0
up 0
by 0
Bishops, 0
the 0
Catholic 0
Church 0
would 0
host 0
a 0
Synod 0
of 0
Bishops 0
on 0
the 0
topic 0
of 0
young 0
people 0
and 0
vocations! 0

Furthermore, 0
this 0
nightmare 0
of 0
a 0
“sinod" 0
is 0
inviting 0
youth 0
from 0
ages 0
16-29 0
to 0
mingle 0
with 0
the 0
Bishops 0
to 0
discuss 0
the 0
Church, 0
faith 0
and 0
vocations. 0

Are 1
you 1
thoroughly 1
disgusted 1
by 1
this 1
farce? 1

The 0
Bishops 0
have 0
proven 0
that 0
they 0
cannot 0
be 0
trusted 0
to 0
protect 0
young 0
people 0
and 0
seminarians 0
from 0
predators. 0

The 0
ever 0
growing 0
global 0
list 0
of 0
Bishops 0
and 0
Cardinals 0
that 0
have 0
preyed 0
on 0
/and 0
or 0
covered 0
up 0
the 0
sexual 0
abuse 0
of 0
minors 0
and 0
seminarians 0
over 0
the 0
last 0
60 0
years 0
continues 0
to 0
enrage 0
the 0
laity. 0

We 0
are 0
no 0
longer 0
Shocked, 0
just 0
fed 0
up. 0

Let’s 0
start 0
with 0
the 0
Cardinal 0
who 0
will 0
lead 0
the 0
upcoming 0
Synod, 0
none 0
other 0
than 0
Cardinal 0
Kevin 0
Farrell, 0
Prefect 0
of 0
the 0
Dicastery 0
for 0
Laity, 0
Family 0
and 0
Life. 0

As 0
the 0
DC 0
roommate 0
and 0
protege 0
of 0
Ted 0
McCarrick, 0
Farrell 0
so 0
respected 0
McCarrick, 0
the 0
Molester, 1
that 0
he 0
fashioned 0
his 0
Coat 0
of 0
Arms 0
as 0
a 0
tribute 0
to 0
Uncle 0
Ted. 0

Farrell’s 0
pathetic 1
and 1
laughable 1
defense 0
“I 0
never 0
knew 0
anything 0
about 0
McCarrick” 0
video 0
highlights 0
the 0
continuing 0
conspiracy 0
of 0
denial 0
by 0
the 0
U.S. 0
Catholic 0
hierarchy. 0

Undoubtedly, 0
Farrell 0
as 0
the 0
head 0
of 0
this 0
Synod 0
chose 0
his 0
dear 0
friend 0
gay 0
friendly, 0
Fr. 0

James 0
Martin, 0
S.J. 0

to 0
keynote 0
the 0
Synod. 0

Farrell’s 0
graciously 0
offers 0
notorious 0
praise 0
for 0
Martin’s 0
new 0
book, 0
Building 0
a 0
Bridge 0
(to 1
hell, 1
ed.) 0

exposes 0
his 0
obvious 0
underlying 0
homosexual 0
agenda 0
and 0
aura 0
of 0
the 0
upcoming 0
Synod: 0

“A 0
welcome 0
and 0
much-needed 0
book 0
that 0
will 0
help 0
bishops, 0
priests, 0
pastoral 0
associates, 0
and 0
all 0
church 0
leaders 0
more 0
compassionately 0
minister 0
to 0
the 0
LGBT 0
community. 0

It 0
will 0
also 0
help 0
LGBT 0
Catholics 0
feel 0
more 0
at 0
home 0
in 0
what 0
is, 0
after 0
all, 0
their 0
church.” 0

What 0
merciful 0
praise 0
for 0
Martin’s 0
book, 0
Cardinal 0
Farrell! 0

Contrary 0
to 0
the 0
theme 0
of 0
mercy 0
and 0
compassion 0
to 0
LGBTs, 0
it 0
appears 0
that 0
your 0
mentor, 0
McCarrick 0
set 0
out 0
to 0
groom 0
and 0
grow 0
an 0
LGBT 0
community. 0

Clearly, 0
you 0
and 0
Fr. 0

Martin 0
have 0
much 0
in 0
common 0
since 0
you 0
both 0
claimed 0
you 0
were 0
“shocked” 0
by 0
the 0
McCarrick 0
allegations. 0

Explain 0
to 0
Catholics 0
why 0
would 0
you 0
headline 0
a 0
homosexual 0
affirming 0
speaker 0
at 0
a 0
Synod 0
for 0
youth 0
and 0
seminarians? 0

In 0
case 0
you 0
haven’t 0
been 0
reading 0
the 0
McCarrick 0
headlines 0
or 0
noticing 0
the 0
plunging 0
mass 0
attendance 0
and 0
collections, 0
Catholics 0
don’t 0
trust 0
their 0
boys 0
around 0
priests 0
and 0
are 0
furious 0
that 0
their 0
seminarians 0
are 0
subjected 0
to 0
unrelenting 0
homosexual 0
sexual 0
harassment. 0

McCarrick 0
is 0
the 0
last 0
straw. 0

All 1
credibility 1
is 1
lost. 1

The 0
October 0
Synod 0
is 0
yet 0
another 0
example 0
of 0
Church 0
leaders 0
exploiting 0
Catholic 0
youth 0
for 0
their 0
own 0
personal 0
power 0
agenda 0
and 0
selfish 0
motives. 0

Bergoglio’s 0
five 0
year 0
plan 0
is 0
nearly 0
complete. 0

Catholics 0
must 0
shed 0
their 0
trust 0
and 0
naivety 0
in 0
the 0
papacy 0
and 0
