The 0
February 0
mass 1
shooting 1
at 0
a 0
high 0
school 0
in 0
Parkland, 0
Florida 0
prompted 0
many 0
parents 0
to 0
consider 0
homeschooling. 1

This 0
is 0
hardly 0
surprising, 0
as 0
the 1
misnamed 1
federal 1
“Gun-Free 1
Schools” 1
law 1
leaves 0
schoolchildren 0
defenseless 1
against 0
mass 0
shooters. 0

Removing 0
one’s 0
children 0
from 0
government 0
schools 0
seems 0
a 0
rational 0
response 0
to 0
school 0
shootings. 1

School 0
shootings 1
are 0
not 0
the 0
only 0
form 0
of 0
violence 1
causing 0
more 0
parents 0
to 0
consider 0
homeschooling. 1

Many 0
potential 0

parents 0
are 0

about 0
the 0
failure 0
of 0
school 0
administrators 0
to 0
effectively 0
protect 1
children 0
from 0

Of 0

The 0
spread 0
of 0
cultural 0
Marxism 0
has 0
contributed 0
to 0
the 0
dumbing 1
down 1
of 0
public 0
education. 0

Too 0
many 0
government 0
schools 0
are 0
more 0
concerned 0
with 0
promoting 0
political 0
correctness 0
than 0
ensuring 0
that 0
students 0
receive 0
a 0
good 0
education. 0

Even 0
if 0
cultural 0
Marxism 0
did 0
not 0
dumb 1
down 1
education, 0
concerns 0
that 0
government 0
schools 0
are 0
indoctrinating 0
children 0
with 0
beliefs 0
that 0
conflict 0
with 0
parents’ 0
political, 0
social, 0
and 0
even 0
religious 0
beliefs 0
would 0
motivate 0
many 0
families 0
to 0
homeschool. 1

Even 0
when 0
government 0
schools 0
are 0
not 0
intentionally 0
promoting 0
cultural 0
Marxism 0
or 0
other 0
left-wing 0
ideologies, 0
they 0
are 0
still 0

toward 0

For 0

how 0
many 0
government 0
schools 0
teach 0
the 0
Austrian 0
economics 0
explanation 0
for 0
the 0
Great 0

— 0

Parents 0
interested 0
in 0
providing 0
their 0
children 0
with 0
a 0
quality 0
education 0
emphasizing 0
the 0
ideas 0
of 0
liberty 0
should 0
consider 0
looking 0
into 0
my 0
homeschooling 1
curriculum. 0

The 0
Ron 0
Paul 0
Curriculum 0
provides 0
students 0
with 0
a 0
well-rounded 1
education 1
that 0
includes 0
rigorous 0
programs 0
in 0
history, 0
mathematics, 0
and 0
the 0
physical 0
and 0
natural 0
sciences. 0

The 0
curriculum 0
also 0
provides 0
instruction 0
in 0
personal 0
finance. 0

Students 0
can 0
develop 0
superior 0
oral 0
and 0
verbal 0
communication 0
skills 0
via 0
intensive 0
writing 0
and 0
public 0
speaking 0
courses. 0

Another 0
feature 0
of 0
my 1
curriculum 1
is 0
that 0
it 0
provides 0
students 0
the 0
opportunity 0
to 0
create 0
and 0
run 0
their 0
own 0
internet 0
businesses. 0

The 0
government 0
and 0
history 0
sections 0
of 0
the 0
curriculum 0
emphasize 0
Austrian 0
economics, 0
libertarian 0
political 0
theory, 0
and 0
the 0
history 0
of 0
liberty. 0

However, 0
unlike 0
government 0
schools, 0
my 1
curriculum 1
never 0
puts 0
ideological 0
indoctrination 1
ahead 0
of 0
education. 0

While 0
government 0
schools 0
— 0
and 0
even 0
many 0
private 0
schools 0
— 0
pretend 0
religion 0
played 0
no 0
significant 0
role 0
in 0
history, 0
my 1
curriculum 1
addresses 0
the 0
crucial 1
role 0
religion 0
played 0
in 0
the 0
development 0
of 0
Western 0
civilization. 0

However, 0
the 0
materials 0
are 0
drafted 0
in 0
such 0
a 0
way 0
that 0
any 0
Christian, 0
Jewish, 0
Muslim, 0
or 0
atheist 0
parent 0
can 0
feel 0
comfortable 0
using 0
the 0
curriculum. 0

Interactive 0
forums 0
allow 0
students 0
to 0
engage 0
with 0
and 0
learn 0
from 0
each 0
other. 0

The 0
forums 0
ensure 0
students 0
are 0
actively 0
engaged 0
in 0
their 0
education 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
give 0
them 0
an 0
opportunity 0
to 0
interact 0
with 0
their 0
peers 0
outside 0
of 0
a 0
formal 0
setting. 0

Concern 0
about 0
the 0
safety 0
of 0
students 0
in 0
government-run 0
schools 0
is 0
one 0
reason 0
many 0
parents 0
are 0
considering 0
homeschooling, 1
but 0
it 0
is 0
not 0
the 0
only 0
reason. 0

Many 0
parents 0
are 0
motivated 0
by 0
a 0
desire 0
to 0
give 0
their 0
children 0
something 0
better 0
than 0
a 0
curriculum 0
that 0
has 0
been 0
dumbed 1
down 1
by 0
federal 0
initiatives 0
like 0
Common 0
Core. 0

Other 0
parents 0
do 0
not 0
wish 0
to 0
have 0
their 0
children 0
indoctrinated 1
with 0
views 0
that 0
contradict 0
the 0
parents’ 0
political, 0
social, 0
or 0
even 0
religious 0
beliefs. 0

I 0
encourage 0
all 0
parents 0
looking 0
at 0
alternatives 0
to 0
government 0
schools 0
—alternatives 0
that 0
provide 0
children 0
with 0
a 0
