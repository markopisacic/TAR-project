President 0
Trump’s 0
sweeping 0
order 0
this 0
week 0
directing 0
intelligence 0
agencies 0
to 0
declassify 0
documents 0
from 0
the 0
more 0
than 0
18-month-old 0
investigation 0
related 0
to 0
the 0
Left’s 0
electoral 0
collusion 0
conspiracy 0
theory 0
involving 0
Trump 0
and 0
Russia 0
may 0
shed 0
light 0
on 0
what 0
really 0
happened 0
in 0
the 0
2016 0
election. 0

In 0
an 0
interview 0
with 0
Hill.TV 0
yesterday, 0
the 0
president 0
said 0
he 0
ordered 0
the 0
mass 0
declassification 0
to 0
show 0
the 0
public 0
that 0
the 0
FBI 0
investigation 0
of 0
the 0
conspiracy 0
theory 0
began 0
as 1
a 1
“hoax.” 1
Exposing 0
it 0
could 0
be 0
one 1
of 1
the 1
“crowning 1
achievements” 1
of 1
his 1
presidency, 1
he 0
said. 0

“What 1
we’ve 1
done 1
is 1
a 1
great 1
service 1
to 1
the 1
country, 1
really,” 1
he 0
said. 0

“I 0
hope 0
to 0
be 0
able 0
to 0
call 0
this, 0
along 0
with 0
tax 0
cuts 0
and 0
regulation 0
and 0
all 0
the 0
things 0
I’ve 0
done… 0
in 0
its 0
own 0
way 0
this 1
might 1
be 1
the 1
most 1
important 1
thing 1
because 0
this 0
was 0
corrupt.” 0

Trump 0
criticized 0
how 0
the 0
FBI 0
handled 0
the 0
Russia 0
probe, 0
accusing 0
it 0
of 0
misleading 0
the 0
Foreign 0
Intelligence 0
Surveillance 0
Act 0
(FISA) 0
court, 0
and 0
of 0
spying 0
on 0
his 0
campaign. 0

“They 0
know 0
this 1
is 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
great 1
scandals 1
in 1
the 1
history 1
of 1
our 1
country 1
because 0
basically 0
what 0
they 0
did 0
is, 0
they 0
used 0
[former 0
Trump 0
campaign 0
aide] 0
Carter 0
Page, 0
who 1
nobody 1
even 1
knew, 1
who 0
I 0
feel 0
very 0
badly 0
for, 0
I 0
think 0
he’s 0
been 0
treated 0
very 0
badly. 0

They 0
used 1
Carter 1
Page 1
as 1
a 1
foil 1
in 0
order 0
to 0
surveil 0
a 0
candidate 0
for 0
the 0
presidency 0
of 0
the 0
United 0
States.” 0

“It’s 1
a 1
hoax, 1
beyond 1
a 1
witch 1
hunt,” 1
Trump 0
said. 0

The 0
documents 0
affected 0
involve 0
a 0
FISA 0
warrant 0
against 0
Carter 0

Although 1
the 1
conspiracy 1
theory 1
is 1
baseless 1
nonsense, 1
it 1
continues 1
to 1
dog 1
the 1
Trump 1
administration, 1
providing 0
cable 0
television 0
news 0
outlets 0
and 0
late-night 0
talk 0
show 0
hosts 0
with 0
endless 1
fodder 1
in 0
the 0
24-hour 0
news 0
cycle. 0

When 0
Trump 1
defenders 1
have 0
fought 0
back, 0
social 0
media 0
companies 0
have 0
colluded 0
with 0
the 0
Left 0
to 0
silence 0
and 0
intimidate 0
them. 0

This 0
declassification 0
effort 0
won’t 0
make 0
things 0
any 0
worse 0
than 0
they 0
are 0
for 0
President 0
Trump. 0

It 0
may 0
even 0
prove 1
a 1
political 1
masterstroke 1
of 0
sorts 0
for 0
Trump. 0

How 0
else 0
does 0
one 0
fight 0
back 0
against 0
the 0
nameless, 1
faceless 1
bureaucrats 1
of 1
the 1
Deep 1
State 1
who 0
hide 0
behind 0
anonymity 0
to 0
undermine 0
the 1
duly 1
elected 1
45th 1
president 1
of 1
the 1

Make 0
the 0
documents 0
public 0
and 1
let 1
the 1
chips 1
fall 1
where 1
they 1
may. 1

There 0
is 0
so 1
much 1
leftist 1
dirt 1
to 0
uncover. 0

For 0
example, 0
it 0
was 0
established 0
some 0
time 0
ago 0
that 0
former 0
President 0
Obama 0
was 0
involved 0
on 0
some 0
level 0
in 0
this 0
shameful 1
un-American 1
plot 1
to 0
rig 0
the 0
2016 0
election 0
and 0
undermine 0
his 0
successor 0
by 0
using 0
the 0
privacy-invading 0
apparatus 0
of 0
the 0
state. 0

Obama 0
wanted 0
“to 0
know 0
everything” 0
the 0
FBI 0
was 0
doing 0
in 0
its 0
investigation 0
into 0
claims 0
that 0
Russia 0
was 0
interfering 0
in 0
the 0
2016 0

Specifically, 0
the 0
statement 0
that 0
Obama 0
wanted 0
“to 0

came 0
