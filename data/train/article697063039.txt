The 0
island’s 0
electrical 0
grid 0
was 0
all 0
but 0
completely 0
destroyed 0
during 0
Hurricane 0
Maria, 0
and 0
many 0
are 0
still 0
struggling 0
without 0
the 0
most 0
basic 0
of 0
necessities. 0

This 0
news 0
comes 0
just 0
one 0
day 0
after 0
Puerto 0
Rico’s 0
Governor 0
Ricardo 0
Rossello 0
asked 0
the 0
federal 0
government 0
for 0
an 0
additional 0
$4.6 0
billion 0
in 0
funding 0
beyond 0
the 0
Trump 0
administration’s 0
request 0
last 0
week 0
for 0
$29 0
billion 0
from 0
Congress 0
for 0
relief 0
efforts. 0

“Puerto 0
Rico 0
has 0
experienced 0
a 1
natural 1
disaster 1
of 1
a 1
magnitude 1
not 1
seen 1
in 1
over 1
a 1
century, 1
and 0
we 1
are 1
doing 1
everything 1
possible 1
to 1
address 1
the 1
needs 1
of 1
the 1
American 1
citizens 1
of 1
Puerto 1
Rico 1
during 1
this 1
time 1
of 1
crisis,” 1
Rosselló 0
wrote. 0

“However, 0
the 1
unprecedented 1
level 1
of 1
destruction, 1
coupled 0
with 0
the 0
almost 0
complete 0
shut-down 0
of 0
business 0
in 0
Puerto 0
Rico, 0
have 0
made 0
it 0
impossible 0
for 0
us 0
to 0
meet 0
the 0
considerable 0
human 0
needs 0
without 0
the 0
measures 0
proposed 0
above,” 0
he 0
added. 0

The 0
White 0
House 0
also 0
announced 0
Monday 0
that 0
it 0
would 0
allow 0
a 0
10-day 0
waiver 0
temporarily 0
blocking 0
the 0
Jones 0
Act 0
to 0
expire. 0

This 0
is 0
devastating 0
news 0
for 0
those 0
living 0
in 0
Puerto 0
Rico, 0
as 0
foreign 0
ships 0
can 0
no 0
longer 0
bring 0
aid 0
to 0
the 1
hurricane-ravaged 1
island 1
from 0
U.S. 0
ports. 0

Officials 0
still 0
expect 0
it 0
to 0
be 0
six 0
more 0
months 0
before 0
electricity 0
can 0
be 0
fully 0
restored 0
to 0
Puerto 0
Rico. 0

As 1
the 1
days 1
have 1
become 1
weeks, 1
the 1
weeks 1
will 1
become 1
months, 1
and 1
survival 1
will 1
get 1
more 1
difficult. 1

Many 0
are 0
now 0
fleeing 0
to 0
the 0
mainland 0
United 0
States 0
just 0
so 0
that 0
they 0
can 0
survive. 0

The 0
economy 0
in 0
Puerto 0
Rico 0
is 0
at 0
a 0
standstill, 0
and 0
without 0
clean 0
drinking 0
water, 0
many 0
are 0
finding 0
life 0
too 0
difficult 0
should 0
they 0
remain 0
on 0
the 0
island 0
and 0
isolated. 0
