Reason 0
He 0
Shouldn’t 0
Be 0
Confirmed 0

In 0
July, 0
President 0
Donald 0
Trump 0
nominated 0
D.C. 0

Circuit 0
Court 0
of 0
Appeals 0
Judge 0
Brett 0
Kavanaugh 0
to 0
the 0
Supreme 0
Court. 0

Since 0
then, 0
there 0
have 0
been 0
numerous 0
allegations 0
of 0
sexual 0
misconduct 0
levied 0
toward 0
the 0
Justice 0
to 0
be. 0

Whether 0
or 0
not 0
he 0
is 0
guilty 0
of 0
these 0
allegations 0
is 0
left 0
to 0
be 0
determined. 0

However, 0
it 0
does 0
serve 0
as 0
a 0
great 0
distraction 0
from 0
his 0
actual 0
constitution-hating 1
and 1
tyrannical 1
tendencies. 1

While 0
Kavanaugh 0
may 0
be 0
an 0
ostensible 0
supporter 0
of 0
the 0
Second 0
Amendment, 0
his 1
record 1
indicates 1
that 1
he 1
all 1
but 1
cannot 1
stand 1
the 1
Fourth 1
and 1
he’s 1
not 1
that 1
big 1
a 1
fan 1
of 1
the 1
First 1
either. 1

While 0
the 0
allegations 0
against 0
Kavanaugh 0
should 0
certainly 0
be 0
investigated 0
— 0
no 0
matter 0
how 0
they 0
are 0
being 0
spun 0
by 0
the 0
left 0
and 0
the 0
right 0
— 0
he 1
shouldn’t 1
even 1
be 1
in 1
this 1
position 1
based 1
solely 1
on 1
his 1
previous 1
record. 1

But 0
no 0
one 0
is 0
talking 0
about 0
this. 0

Instead, 0
the 0
left 0
and 0
right 0
are 0
involved 0
in 0
a 1
mudslinging 1
orgy 1
of 1
victim 1
shaming 1
and 1
kangaroo 1
courts. 1

to 0
this 0
Supreme 0
Court 0
nominee, 0
he 0
thinks 0
it 1
is 1
just 1
fine 1
and 1
dandy 1
for 0
police 0
and 0
government 0
to 0
track 0
you, 0
spy 0
on 0
you, 0
and 0
dig 0
through 0
your 0
personal 0
life 0
— 0
without 0
a 0
warrant. 0

On 0
multiple 0
occasions, 0
Kavanaugh 0
has 0
been 0
the 0
lone 0
voice 0
when 0
it 0
comes 0
supporting 0
the 0
state’s 0
rights 0
to 0
warrantlessly 0
spy 0
on 0
its 0
citizens. 0

As 0
Reason 0
points 0
out, 0
in 0
2010 0
he 0
dissented 0
from 0
the 0
D.C. 0
Circuit’s 0
decision 0
not 0
to 0
rehear 0
a 0
case 0
in 0
which 0
a 0
three-judge 0
panel 0
had 0
ruled 0
that 0
police 0
violated 0
a 0
suspected 0
drug 0
dealer’s 0
Fourth 0
Amendment 0
rights 0
when 0
they 0
tracked 0
his 0
movements 0
for 0
a 0
month 0
by 0
attaching 0
a 0
GPS 0
device 0
to 0
his 0
car 0
without 0
a 0
warrant. 0

Kavanaugh 0
claimed 0
that 0
putting 0
a 0
GPS 0
tracking 0
device 0
on 0
a 0
person’s 0
car 0
without 0
first 0
obtaining 0
a 0
warrant 0
was 0
just 0
fine 0
because 0
it 0
didn’t 0
constitute 0
a 0
“search” 0
as 0
defined 0
by 0
the 0
Fourth 0
Amendment. 0

To 0
Kavanaugh, 0
bypassing 0
the 0
courts 0
and 0
tracking 0
an 0
individual 0
without 0
their 0
consent 0
is 0
“constitutional.” 0
In 0
this 0
line 0
of 0
thinking, 0
the 0
Fourth 0
Amendment 0
is 0
not 0
violated 0
even 0
if 0
police 0
trespass 0
on 0
someone’s 0
physical 0
property, 0
or 0
track 0
someone’s 0
cell 0
phone. 0

Luckily, 0
he 0
was 0
the 0
only 0
judge 0
on 0
the 0
panel 0
to 0
think 0
this. 0

In 0
June, 0
the 0
Supreme 0
Court 0
ruled 0
specifically 0
on 0
this 0
case 0
noting 0
that 0
collecting 0
such 0
information 0
actually 0
does 0
constitute 0
a 0
search 0
and 0
therefore 0
requires 0
a 0
warrant. 0

But 0
it 0
gets 0
worse. 0

In 0
2015, 0
Kavanaugh 0
issued 0
a 0
statement 0
strongly 0
defending 0
the 0
NSA’s 0
phone 0
metadata 0
collection 0
program, 0
arguing 0
that 0
it 0
is 0
“entirely 0
consistent 0
with 0
the 0
Fourth 0
Amendment.” 0
To 0
Kavanaugh, 0
sweeping 0
programs 0
that 0
collect 0
information 0
from 0
innocent 0
citizens’ 0
phones 0
are 0
not 0
in 0
conflict 0
with 0
having 0
the 0
right 0
to 0
be 0
free 0
from 0
unlawful 0
search 0
and 0
seizure. 0

Seriously. 1

According 0
to 0
Kavanaugh, 0
the 0
Fourth 0
Amendment 0
allows 0
for 0
searches 0
“without 0
individualized 0
suspicion” 0
when 0
the 0
government 0
demonstrates 0
a 0
“special 0
need” 0
that 0
“outweighs 0
the 0
intrusion 0
on 0
individual 0
liberty.” 0

Exactly 0
what 0
this 0
“special 0
need” 0
is 0
that 0
can 0
constitute 0
a 0
Gestapo 1
like 1
police 1
state 1
surveilling 1
its 0
own 0
citizens 0
is 0
a 0
moving 0
target 0
that 0
has 0
already 0
been 0
proven 0
to 0
be 0
abused 0
over 0
and 0
over 0
again. 0

“The 0
sacrifice 0
of 0
our 0
personal 0
liberty 0
for 0
security 0
is 0
and 0
will 0
forever 0
be 0
a 0
false 0
choice,” 0
Senator 0
Rand 0
Paul 0
said 0
of 0
Kavanaugh’s 0
views 0
on 0
the 0
disposable 0
nature 0
of 0
the 0
constitution. 0

Kavanaugh 0
“has 0
no 0
qualms 0
about 0
applying 0
decades-old 0
case 0
law 0
to 0
the 0
digital 0
age, 0
and 0
he 0
has 0
endorsed 0
the 0
idea 0
of 0
a 0
“counterterrorism 0
exception” 0
to 0
the 0
Fourth 0
Amendment’s 0
warrant 0
requirement,” 0
said 0
Liza 0
Goitein, 0
co-director 0
of 0
the 0
Brennan 0
Center 0
for 0
Justice’s 0
Liberty 0
and 0
National 0
Security 0
Program. 0

While 0
the 0
left 0
is 0
calling 0
for 0
Kavanaugh 0
to 1
be 1
executed 1
over 1
the 1
sex 1
abuse 1
allegations 1
and 0
the 0
right 0
is 0
attacking 0
the 0
alleged 0
victims, 0
others 0
in 0
Congress 0
who 0
see 0
through 0
the 0
facade 0
and 0
media 0
distraction 0
are 0
trying 0
to 0
draw 0
attention 0
to 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
Kavanaugh 0
is 0
a 0
champion 1
of 1
the 1
police 1
and 1
surveillance 1
state 1
and 1
an 1
enemy 1
to 1
privacy. 1

Representative 0
Justin 0
Amash 0
does 0
not 0
have 0
a 0
vote 0
on 0
whether 0
or 0
not 0
Kavanaugh 0
will 0
be 0
appointed. 0

However, 0
this 0
hasn’t 0
prevented 0
him 0
from 0
becoming 0
the 0
only 0
Republican 0
to 0
speak 0
out 0
against 0
the 0
real 0
reasons 0
he 0
should 0
not 0
be 0
appointed 0
to 0
Supreme 0
Court. 0

“Privacy 1
advocates 1
must 1
fight,” 1
Amash 0
tweeted. 0

“There 0
are 0
many 0
potential 0
nominees 0
with 0
a 0
conservative 0
record 0
on 0
abortion, 0
guns, 0
and 0
regulations. 0

The 1
only 1
question 1
is 1
will 1
the 1
Senate 1
confirm 1
one 1
who 1
is 1
really 1
bad 1
on 1
the 1
#4thAmendment, 1
when 0
so 0
much 0
is 0
at 0
stake 0
in 0
upcoming 0
digital 0
privacy 0
battles.” 0

Indeed, 0
as 0
technology 0
increases, 0
so 0
does 0
the 0
desire 0
of 0
the 0
state 0
to 0
use 0
it 0
to 0
spy 0
on 0
us. 0

The 0
cases 0
headed 0
to 0
the 0
supreme 0
court 0
in 0
the 0
future 0
over 0
what 0
constitutes 0
an 0
unconstitutional 0
search 0
will 0
undoubtedly 0
be 0
vast 0
in 0
number 0
and 0
detrimental 0
in 0
deciding 0
how 0
much 0
freedom 0
and 0
privacy 0
Americans 0
get 0
to 0
keep. 0

As 0
for 0
if 0
Kavanaugh 0
gets 0
appointed, 0
Amash 0
has 0
some 0
harsh 0
words 0
to 0
those 0
who 0
are 0
blindly 1
supporting 1
him 1
based 0
on 0
party 0
lines: 0

“When 1
Kavanaugh 1
is 1
on 1
the 1
Supreme 1
Court, 1
undermining 1
our 1
#4thAmendment 1
right 1
against 1
unreasonable 1
searches 1
and 1
seizures, 1
it 1
will 1
be 1
too 1

for 1

to 1
join 1
