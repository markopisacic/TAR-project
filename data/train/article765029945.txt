2 0 266 1
very 0 266 1
simple 0 266 1

The 0 266 3
Muslim 0 266 3
Brotherhood's 0 266 3
leaders 0 266 3
praising 0 266 3
Hitler, 0 266 3
calling 0 266 3
for 0 266 3
another 0 266 3
Holocaust 0 266 3
and 0 266 3
killing 0 266 3
Jews 0 266 3
is 0 266 3
nothing 0 266 3
like 0 266 3
the 0 266 3
Holocaust. 0 266 3

And 0 266 4
only 1 266 4
shameless 1 266 4
Zionists 1 266 4
would 1 266 4
attempt 1 266 4
to 1 266 4
equate 1 266 4
killing 1 266 4

Anything 1 266 6
a 1 266 6
Republican 1 266 6
president 1 266 6
does 1 266 6
is 1 266 6
exactly 1 266 6
like 1 266 6
the 1 266 6
Holocaust. 1 266 6

A 0 266 7
former 0 266 7
CIA 0 266 7
director 0 266 7
compared 1 266 7
US 1 266 7
immigration 1 266 7
policy 1 266 7
to 1 266 7
Nazi 1 266 7
Germany 1 266 7
in 0 266 7
an 0 266 7
ominous 0 266 7
Tweet. 0 266 7

“Other 0 266 8
governments 0 266 8
have 0 266 8
separated 0 266 8
mothers 0 266 8
and 0 266 8
children,” 0 266 8
Former 0 266 8
CIA 0 266 8
and 0 266 8
NSA 0 266 8
chief 0 266 8
Michael 0 266 8
Hayden 0 266 8
wrote 0 266 8
on 0 266 8
Saturday, 0 266 8
along 0 266 8
with 0 266 8
a 0 266 8
black 0 266 8
and 0 266 8
white 0 266 8
photo 0 266 8
of 0 266 8
the 0 266 8
Birkenau 0 266 8
concentration 0 266 8
and 0 266 8
death-camp 1 266 8
in 0 266 8
Poland. 0 266 8

Then 0 266 9
Hayden 0 266 9
doubled 0 266 9
down 0 266 9
on 0 266 9
that 0 266 9
analogy. 0 266 9

It's 0 266 10
particularly 1 266 10
stupid 1 266 10
of 0 266 10
Michael 0 266 10
Hayden 0 266 10
to 0 266 10
make 0 266 10
that 0 266 10
analogy 0 266 10
because 0 266 10
during 0 266 10
the 0 266 10
Bush 0 266 10
years, 0 266 10
the 0 266 10
agencies 0 266 10
he 0 266 10
ran 0 266 10
were 0 266 10
compared 0 266 10
to 0 266 10
Nazi 1 266 10
Germany. 0 266 10

Repeatedly. 0 266 11

You 0 266 12
might 0 266 12
think 0 266 12
that 0 266 12
would 0 266 12
have 0 266 12
cured 0 266 12
him 0 266 12
of 0 266 12
facile 0 266 12
Nazi 1 266 12
analogies. 0 266 12

But 0 266 13
instead 0 266 13
it 0 266 13
seems 0 266 13
to 0 266 13
have 0 266 13
whetted 0 266 13
his 0 266 13
appetite 0 266 13
for 0 266 13
making 0 266 13
them. 0 266 13

Yes, 0 266 14
the 0 266 14
Nazi 1 266 14
arrested 0 266 14
people, 0 266 14
asked 0 266 14
them 0 266 14
for 0 266 14
ID, 0 266 14
split 0 266 14
up 0 266 14
families 0 266 14
and... 0 266 14
then 0 266 14
killed 1 266 14
them 1 266 14
all. 1 266 14

That's 0 266 15
the 0 266 15
really 0 266 15
relevant 0 266 15
part. 0 266 15

Every 0 266 16
country 0 266 16
arrests 0 266 16
people. 0 266 16

Just 0 266 17
about 0 266 17
every 0 266 17
country 0 266 17
splits 0 266 17
up 0 266 17
families 0 266 17
when 0 266 17
they 0 266 17
arrest 0 266 17
the 0 266 17
parents. 0 266 17

That's 0 266 18
not 0 266 18
unique. 0 266 18

Selecting 0 266 19
the 0 266 19
Jews, 0 266 19
based 0 266 19
on 0 266 19
race, 0 266 19
for 0 266 19
extermination 1 266 19
is 0 266 19
more 0 266 19
of 0 266 19
the 0 266 19
reason 0 266 19
why 0 266 19
the 0 266 19
term 0 266 19
Nazi 1 266 19
is 0 266 19
not 0 266 19
a 0 266 19
positive 0 266 19
one. 0 266 19

Hayden's 0 266 20
thoughtless 1 266 20
tweet 0 266 20
can 0 266 20
just 0 266 20
as 0 266 20
easily 0 266 20
be 0 266 20
used 0 266 20
to 0 266 20
delegitimize 0 266 20
any 0 266 20
and 0 266 20
all 0 266 20
law 0 266 20
enforcement. 0 266 20

The 1 266 21
attacks 1 266 21
here 1 266 21
are 1 266 21
motivated 1 266 21
by 1 266 21
a 1 266 21
desire 1 266 21
for 1 266 21
open 1 266 21
borders. 1 266 21
