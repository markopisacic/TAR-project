you 0

the 0
party’s 0
investigation 0
of 0
the 0
allegations 0
against 0
Ellison 0
will 0
be 0
finished 0
soon, 0

to 0
the 0

An 0

and 0
Kim 0

The 0

a 0
statement 0
from 0
Kim 0
Ellison 0
on 0
behalf 0
of 0
both 0
her 0
and 0
Keith 0
Ellison. 0

“Our 0
divorce 0
simply 0
isn’t 0
the 0
public’s 0
business, 0
and 0
therefore, 0
when 0
we 0
separated, 0
we 0
jointly 0
asked 0
the 0
court 0
to 0
seal 0
the 0
file. 0

Now, 0
one 0
month 0
before 0
a 0
closely 0
contested 0
election 0
for 0
Minnesota 0
Attorney 0
General, 0
a 0
conservative 0
group 0
wants 0
to 0
probe 0
our 0
divorce 0
file 0
in 0
search 0
of 0
something 0
to 0
use 0
against 0
Keith 0
in 0
this 0
race. 0

I 0
am 0
disappointed 0
that 0
the 0
Star 0
Tribune 0
would 0
choose 0
to 0
file 0
this 0
motion.” 0
