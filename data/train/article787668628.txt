She 0 350 14
claims 0 350 14
that 0 350 14
Kavanaugh 0 350 14
knocked 0 350 14
her 0 350 14
down, 0 350 14
groped 0 350 14

attempted 0 350 14
to 0 350 14

her 0 350 14
clothes. 0 350 14

Here’s 0 350 15
the 0 350 15
core 0 350 15
of 0 350 15
her 0 350 15
story: 0 350 15

While 0 350 16
his 0 350 16
friend 0 350 16
watched, 0 350 16
she 0 350 16
said, 0 350 16
Kavanaugh 0 350 16
pinned 0 350 16
her 0 350 16
to 0 350 16
a 0 350 16
bed 0 350 16
on 0 350 16
her 0 350 16
back 0 350 16
and 0 350 16
groped 0 350 16
her 0 350 16
over 0 350 16
her 0 350 16
clothes, 0 350 16
grinding 0 350 16
his 0 350 16
body 0 350 16
against 0 350 16
hers 0 350 16
and 0 350 16
clumsily 0 350 16
attempting 0 350 16
to 0 350 16
pull 0 350 16
off 0 350 16
her 0 350 16
one-piece 0 350 16
bathing 0 350 16
suit 0 350 16
and 0 350 16
the 0 350 16
clothing 0 350 16
she 0 350 16
wore 0 350 16
over 0 350 16
it. 0 350 16

When 0 350 17
she 0 350 17
tried 0 350 17
to 0 350 17
scream, 0 350 17
she 0 350 17
said, 0 350 17
he 0 350 17
put 0 350 17
his 0 350 17
hand 0 350 17
over 0 350 17
her 0 350 17
mouth. 0 350 17

“I 0 350 18
thought 0 350 18
he 0 350 18
might 0 350 18
inadvertently 0 350 18
kill 0 350 18
me,” 0 350 18
said 0 350 18
Ford, 0 350 18
now 0 350 18
a 0 350 18
51-year-old 0 350 18
research 0 350 18
psychologist 0 350 18
in 0 350 18
northern 0 350 18
California. 0 350 18

“He 0 350 19
was 0 350 19
trying 0 350 19
to 0 350 19
attack 0 350 19
me 0 350 19
and 0 350 19
remove 0 350 19
my 0 350 19
clothing.” 0 350 19
Ford 0 350 19
said 0 350 19
she 0 350 19
was 0 350 19
able 0 350 19
to 0 350 19
escape 0 350 19
when 0 350 19
Kavanaugh’s 0 350 19
friend 0 350 19
and 0 350 19
classmate 0 350 19
at 0 350 19
Georgetown 0 350 19
Preparatory 0 350 19
School, 0 350 19
Mark 0 350 19
Judge, 0 350 19
jumped 0 350 19
on 0 350 19
top 0 350 19
of 0 350 19
them, 0 350 19
sending 0 350 19
all 0 350 19
three 0 350 19
tumbling. 0 350 19

She 0 350 20
said 0 350 20
she 0 350 20
ran 0 350 20
from 0 350 20
the 0 350 20
room, 0 350 20
briefly 0 350 20
locked 0 350 20
herself 0 350 20
in 0 350 20
a 0 350 20
bathroom 0 350 20
and 0 350 20
then 0 350 20
fled 0 350 20
the 0 350 20
house. 0 350 20

Do 0 350 21
not 0 350 21
count 0 350 21
me 0 350 21
among 0 350 21
those 0 350 21
who 0 350 21
would 0 350 21
minimize 0 350 21
this 0 350 21
alleged 0 350 21
assault. 0 350 21

I 0 350 22
went 0 350 22
to 0 350 22
a 0 350 22
high 0 350 22
school 0 350 22
that 0 350 22
had 0 350 22
more 0 350 22
than 0 350 22
its 0 350 22
share 0 350 22
of 0 350 22
drunken 0 350 22
parties, 0 350 22
and 0 350 22
my 0 350 22
classmates 0 350 22
could 0 350 22
do 0 350 22
crazy 0 350 22
and 0 350 22
stupid 0 350 22
things, 0 350 22
but 0 350 22
an 0 350 22
act 0 350 22
like 0 350 22
this 0 350 22
was 0 350 22
beyond 0 350 22
the 0 350 22
pale. 0 350 22

This 0 350 23
isn’t 0 350 23
“boys 1 350 23
will 1 350 23
be 1 350 23
boys.” 1 350 23
Actions 0 350 23
have 0 350 23
consequences, 0 350 23
and 0 350 23
it’s 0 350 23
hardly 0 350 23
unjust 0 350 23
to 0 350 23
tell 0 350 23
a 0 350 23
person 0 350 23
that 0 350 23
if 0 350 23
he 0 350 23
mistreated 0 350 23
another 0 350 23
human 0 350 23
being 0 350 23
like 0 350 23
this 0 350 23
— 0 350 23
even 0 350 23
a 0 350 23
long 0 350 23
time 0 350 23
ago 0 350 23
— 0 350 23
he 0 350 23
has 0 350 23
to 0 350 23
remain 0 350 23
“merely” 0 350 23
a 0 350 23
judge 0 350 23
on 0 350 23
the 0 350 23
D.C. 0 350 23

Circuit 0 350 24
Court 0 350 24
of 0 350 24
Appeals. 0 350 24

Since 0 350 25
Kavanaugh 0 350 25
has 0 350 25
denied 0 350 25
the 0 350 25
story, 0 350 25
however, 0 350 25
the 0 350 25
question 0 350 25
of 0 350 25
whether 0 350 25
the 0 350 25
event 0 350 25
is 0 350 25
so 0 350 25
egregious 0 350 25
that 0 350 25
it 0 350 25
should 0 350 25
disqualify 0 350 25
him 0 350 25
is 0 350 25
moot. 0 350 25

At 0 350 26
the 0 350 26
very 0 350 26
least, 0 350 26
if 0 350 26
the 0 350 26
attack 0 350 26
happened, 0 350 26
he 0 350 26
should 0 350 26
be 0 350 26
disqualified 0 350 26
for 0 350 26
lying. 0 350 26

Yet 0 350 27
unless 0 350 27
all 0 350 27
parties 0 350 27
start 0 350 27
telling 0 350 27
the 0 350 27
same 0 350 27
story, 0 350 27
there 0 350 27
is 0 350 27
no 0 350 27
way 0 350 27
to 0 350 27
know 0 350 27
for 0 350 27
certain 0 350 27
if 0 350 27
this 0 350 27
event 0 350 27
occurred. 0 350 27

We 0 350 28
don’t 0 350 28
need 0 350 28
certainty, 0 350 28
however, 0 350 28
to 0 350 28
make 0 350 28
a 0 350 28
decision 0 350 28
on 0 350 28
whether 0 350 28
a 0 350 28
man 0 350 28
should 0 350 28
sit 0 350 28
on 0 350 28
the 0 350 28
Supreme 0 350 28
Court. 0 350 28

I 0 350 29
have 0 350 29
the 0 350 29
same 0 350 29
standard 0 350 29
for 0 350 29
Brett 0 350 29
Kavanaugh 0 350 29
as 0 350 29
I 0 350 29
did 0 350 29
for 0 350 29
Roy 0 350 29
Moore, 0 350 29
for 0 350 29
Donald 0 350 29
Trump, 0 350 29
for 0 350 29
Bill 0 350 29
Clinton 0 350 29
— 0 350 29
or 0 350 29
for 0 350 29
any 0 350 29
other 0 350 29
politician 0 350 29
who’s 0 350 29
accused 0 350 29
of 0 350 29
misconduct. 0 350 29

Is 0 350 30
it 0 350 30
more 0 350 30
likely 0 350 30
than 0 350 30
not 0 350 30
that 0 350 30
the 0 350 30
allegation 0 350 30
is 0 350 30
true? 0 350 30

Given 0 350 31
the 0 350 31
totality 0 350 31
of 0 350 31
the 0 350 31
evidence, 0 350 31
I 0 350 31
believe 0 350 31
it 0 350 31
is 0 350 31
more 0 350 31
likely 0 350 31
than 0 350 31
not 0 350 31
that 0 350 31
Bill 0 350 31
Clinton 0 350 31
committed 0 350 31
rape 0 350 31
and 0 350 31
sexual 0 350 31
harassment. 0 350 31

I 0 350 32
believe 0 350 32
it 0 350 32
is 0 350 32
more 0 350 32
likely 0 350 32
than 0 350 32
not 0 350 32
that 0 350 32
Donald 0 350 32
Trump 0 350 32
has 0 350 32
committed 0 350 32
sexual 0 350 32
assault. 0 350 32

I 0 350 33
believe 0 350 33
it 0 350 33
is 0 350 33
more 0 350 33
likely 0 350 33
than 0 350 33
not 0 350 33
that 0 350 33
Roy 0 350 33
Moore 0 350 33
engaged 0 350 33
in 0 350 33
sexual 0 350 33
misconduct 0 350 33
with 0 350 33
underage 0 350 33
girls. 0 350 33

But 0 350 34
the 0 350 34
evidence 0 350 34
against 0 350 34
Kavanaugh 0 350 34
falls 0 350 34
far 0 350 34
short 0 350 34
of 0 350 34
the 0 350 34
evidence 0 350 34
arrayed 0 350 34
against 0 350 34
each 0 350 34
of 0 350 34
these 0 350 34
men. 0 350 34

So 0 350 35
far 0 350 35
at 0 350 35
least 0 350 35
it 1 350 35
falls 1 350 35
far 1 350 35
short 1 350 35
of 1 350 35
the 1 350 35
evidence 1 350 35
against 1 350 35
virtually 1 350 35
any 1 350 35
other 1 350 35
politician 1 350 35
or 1 350 35
celebrity 1 350 35
who 1 350 35
has 1 350 35
faced 1 350 35
consequences 1 350 35
during 0 350 35
this 0 350 35
#MeToo 0 350 35
moment. 0 350 35

Here’s 0 350 36
why: 0 350 36

First, 0 350 37
one 0 350 37
way 0 350 37
to 0 350 37
help 0 350 37
test 0 350 37
the 0 350 37
veracity 0 350 37
of 0 350 37
old 0 350 37
claims 0 350 37
is 0 350 37
to 0 350 37
ask 0 350 37
whether 0 350 37
there 0 350 37
is 0 350 37
any 0 350 37
contemporaneous 0 350 37
corroboration. 0 350 37

Did 0 350 38
the 0 350 38
accuser 0 350 38
tell 0 350 38
a 0 350 38
friend 0 350 38
or 0 350 38
family 0 350 38
member 0 350 38
or 0 350 38
anyone 0 350 38
about 0 350 38
the 0 350 38
alleged 0 350 38
assault 0 350 38
when 0 350 38
it 0 350 38
occurred? 0 350 38

With 0 350 39
Clinton, 0 350 39
Trump, 0 350 39
Moore, 0 350 39
and 0 350 39
many 0 350 39
other 0 350 39
politicians 0 350 39
and 0 350 39
celebrities, 0 350 39
there 0 350 39
was 0 350 39
ample 0 350 39
contemporaneous 0 350 39
corroboration. 0 350 39

Here, 0 350 40
there 0 350 40
was 0 350 40
not. 0 350 40

According 0 350 41
to 0 350 41
the 0 350 41
Washington 0 350 41
Post, 0 350 41
“Ford 0 350 41
said 0 350 41
she 0 350 41
told 0 350 41
no 0 350 41
one 0 350 41
of 0 350 41
the 0 350 41
incident 0 350 41
in 0 350 41
any 0 350 41
detail 0 350 41
until 0 350 41
2012, 0 350 41
when 0 350 41
she 0 350 41
was 0 350 41
in 0 350 41
couples 0 350 41
therapy 0 350 41
with 0 350 41
her 0 350 41
husband.” 0 350 41

That’s 0 350 42
almost 0 350 42
three 0 350 42
decades 0 350 42
of 0 350 42
silence 0 350 42
— 0 350 42
three 0 350 42
decades 0 350 42
when 0 350 42
memories 0 350 42
can 0 350 42
grow 0 350 42
cloudy 0 350 42
and 0 350 42
recollections 0 350 42
can 0 350 42
change. 0 350 42

But 0 350 43
even 0 350 43
the 0 350 43
allegedly 0 350 43
corroborating 0 350 43
notes 0 350 43
of 0 350 43
the 0 350 43
therapist 0 350 43
raise 0 350 43
a 0 350 43
separate 0 350 43
problem. 0 350 43

They 0 350 44
actually 0 350 44
contradict 0 350 44
her 0 350 44
story 0 350 44
on 0 350 44
a 0 350 44
key 0 350 44
detail. 0 350 44

According 0 350 45
to 0 350 45
the 0 350 45
Post, 0 350 45
“The 0 350 45
notes 0 350 45
say 0 350 45
four 0 350 45
boys 0 350 45
were 0 350 45
involved, 0 350 45
a 0 350 45
discrepancy 0 350 45
that 0 350 45
Ford 0 350 45
says 0 350 45
was 0 350 45
an 0 350 45
error 0 350 45
on 0 350 45
the 0 350 45
therapist’s 0 350 45
part. 0 350 45

Ford 0 350 46
said 0 350 46
there 0 350 46
were 0 350 46
four 0 350 46
boys 0 350 46
at 0 350 46
the 0 350 46
party 0 350 46
but 0 350 46
only 0 350 46
two 0 350 46
in 0 350 46
the 0 350 46
room.” 0 350 46
Nor 0 350 46
do 0 350 46
the 0 350 46
notes 0 350 46
mention 0 350 46
Kavanaugh’s 0 350 46
name, 0 350 46
even 0 350 46
though 0 350 46
her 0 350 46
husband 0 350 46
says 0 350 46
Ford 0 350 46
named 0 350 46
Kavanaugh 0 350 46
in 0 350 46
the 0 350 46
sessions. 0 350 46

Those 0 350 47
are 0 350 47
important 0 350 47
discrepancies, 0 350 47
and 1 350 47
if 1 350 47
six 1 350 47
years 1 350 47
ago 1 350 47
she 1 350 47
told 1 350 47
the 1 350 47
therapist 1 350 47
four 1 350 47
men 1 350 47
and 1 350 47
says 1 350 47
two 1 350 47
men 1 350 47
now, 1 350 47
that 1 350 47
suggests 1 350 47
that 1 350 47
her 1 350 47
memory 1 350 47
of 1 350 47
the 1 350 47
event 1 350 47
may 1 350 47
be 1 350 47
suspect. 1 350 47

As 0 350 48
a 0 350 48
former 0 350 48
trial 0 350 48
lawyer, 0 350 48
I 1 350 48
can 1 350 48
tell 1 350 48
you 1 350 48
that 1 350 48
while 1 350 48
neither 1 350 48
notes 1 350 48
nor 1 350 48
memories 1 350 48
are 1 350 48
infallible, 1 350 48
in 1 350 48
a 1 350 48
contest 1 350 48
between 1 350 48
contemporaneous 1 350 48
notes 1 350 48
and 1 350 48
later 1 350 48
verbal 1 350 48
testimony 1 350 48
about 1 350 48
those 1 350 48
notes, 1 350 48
the 1 350 48
content 1 350 48
of 1 350 48
the 1 350 48
written 1 350 48
notes 1 350 48
usually 1 350 48
prevails. 1 350 48

Juries 0 350 49
are 0 350 49
extremely 1 350 49
skeptical 1 350 49
of 0 350 49
witnesses 0 350 49
who 0 350 49
contradict 0 350 49
written 0 350 49
notes 0 350 49
— 0 350 49
after 0 350 49
all, 0 350 49
the 0 350 49
notes 0 350 49
are 0 350 49
taken 0 350 49
when 0 350 49
the 0 350 49
words 0 350 49
are 0 350 49
immediate 0 350 49
and 0 350 49
there 0 350 49
isn’t 0 350 49
the 0 350 49
overwhelming 0 350 49
pressure 0 350 49
of 0 350 49
a 0 350 49
trial 0 350 49
to 0 350 49
conform 0 350 49
your 0 350 49
testimony 0 350 49
to 0 350 49
the 0 350 49
desired 0 350 49
outcome. 0 350 49

At 0 350 50
least 0 350 50
the 0 350 50
investigation 0 350 50
seems 0 350 50
somewhat 0 350 50
manageable. 0 350 50

If 0 350 51
there 0 350 51
were 0 350 51
only 0 350 51
four 0 350 51
boys 0 350 51
there, 0 350 51
who 0 350 51
were 0 350 51
the 0 350 51
other 0 350 51
two? 0 350 51

Let’s 0 350 52
hear 0 350 52
from 0 350 52
them. 0 350 52

In 0 350 53
fact, 0 350 53
investigators 0 350 53
should 0 350 53
interview 0 350 53
everyone 0 350 53
else 0 350 53
at 0 350 53
the 0 350 53
party. 0 350 53

Yet 0 350 54
given 0 350 54
all 0 350 54
the 0 350 54
years 0 350 54
that 0 350 54
have 0 350 54
passed, 0 350 54
would 0 350 54
it 0 350 54
be 0 350 54
possible 0 350 54
to 0 350 54
find 0 350 54
anyone 0 350 54
who 0 350 54
remembers 0 350 54
being 0 350 54
at 0 350 54
that 0 350 54
party? 0 350 54

Would 0 350 55
they 0 350 55
remember 0 350 55
any 0 350 55
details 0 350 55
at 0 350 55
all? 0 350 55

If 0 350 56
someone 0 350 56
saw 0 350 56
Kavanaugh 0 350 56
stumbling 1 350 56
drunk 1 350 56
at 0 350 56
the 0 350 56
party, 0 350 56
that 0 350 56
would 0 350 56
obviously 0 350 56
bolster 0 350 56
Ford’s 0 350 56
account. 0 350 56

If 0 350 57
another 0 350 57
attendee 0 350 57
says, 0 350 57
“He 0 350 57
was 0 350 57
totally 0 350 57
sober 0 350 57
and 0 350 57
with 0 350 57
me 0 350 57
the 0 350 57
whole 0 350 57
time,” 0 350 57
that 0 350 57
helps 0 350 57
Kavanaugh. 0 350 57

But 0 350 57

the 0 350 57

odds 0 350 57

of 0 350 57

getting 0 350 57

details 0 350 57

that 0 350 57

precise 0 350 57

are 0 350 57

long 0 350 57

indeed, 0 350 57

and 0 350 57

there 0 350 57

is 0 350 57

always 0 350 57

a 0 350 57

chance 0 350 57

that 0 350 57

a 0 350 57

motivated 0 350 57

classmate 0 350 57

might 0 350 57

lie 0 350 57

— 0 350 57

for 0 350 57

either 0 350 57

person…. 0 350 57
