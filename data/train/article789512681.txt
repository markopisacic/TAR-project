Ellison 0 368 26
not 0 368 26

claimed 0 368 26
the 0 368 26
women 0 368 26
were 0 368 26
lying 0 368 26
but 0 368 26
then 0 368 26
fled 0 368 26
the 0 368 26
scene. 0 368 26

At 0 368 27
least 0 368 27
he 0 368 27
said 0 368 27
something 0 368 27
there, 0 368 27
which 0 368 27
is 0 368 27
more 0 368 27
than 0 368 27
I 0 368 27
can 0 368 27
say 0 368 27
for 0 368 27
his 0 368 27
response 0 368 27
earlier 0 368 27
in 0 368 27

Failing 0 368 28
to 0 368 28
answer, 0 368 28
Ellison 0 368 28
tried 0 368 28
to 0 368 28
move 0 368 28
from 0 368 28
person 0 368 28
to 0 368 28

allowing 0 368 28
his 0 368 28

to 0 368 28
try 0 368 28
and 0 368 28
provide 0 368 28
cover 0 368 28
for 0 368 28
him, 0 368 28
similar 0 368 28
to 0 368 28
that 0 368 28
of 0 368 28

Finally, 0 368 29

Ellison 0 368 77
to 0 368 77

contrary 0 368 77
notwithstanding, 0 368 77
Soliah/Olson 0 368 77
pleaded 0 368 77
guilty 0 368 77

According 0 368 78
to 0 368 78
Ellison, 0 368 78
Soliah/Olson 0 368 78
was 0 368 78
a 0 368 78
social 0 368 78
justice 0 368 78
warrior 0 368 78
fighting 0 368 78

The 0 368 79

had 0 368 79
nothing 0 368 79

with 0 368 79
the 0 368 79
attempted 0 368 79

that 0 368 79
was 0 368 79
but 0 368 79
a 0 368 79
pretext. 0 368 79

Seems 0 368 80
he 0 368 80
is 0 368 80
more 0 368 80
than 0 368 80
willing 0 368 80
to 0 368 80

him 0 368 80

the 0 368 80
press 0 368 80
who 0 368 80
will 0 368 80
confront 0 368 80
him 0 368 80
publicly 0 368 80
while 0 368 80
taking 0 368 80
the 0 368 80
side 0 368 80
of 0 368 80
