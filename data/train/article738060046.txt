Pamela 0

and 0
I 0
are 0
banned 0
from 0
entering 0
the 0
country 0
for 0
the 0
crime 0
of 0
telling 0
the 0
truth 0
about 0
Islam 0
and 0
jihad. 0

According 0
to 0
Breitbart, 0
“Sellner, 0
who 0
described 0
the 0
detention 0
centre 0
as 0
looking 0
akin 0
to 0
a 0
typical 0
American 0
prison, 0
said 0
he 1
was 1
told 1
by 1
authorities 1
that 1
his 1
speaking 1
at 1
Hyde 1
Park 1
could 1
cause 1
violence 1
and 1
disrupt 1
community 1
cohesion.” 1

That’s 1
just 1
what 1
they 1
claimed 1
about 1
Pamela 1
Geller 1
and 1
me: 1
that 1
our 1
visit 1
could 1
cause 1
violence 1
and 1
disrupt 1
community 1
cohesion. 1

But 0
we, 0
of 0
course, 0
have 0
never 0
advocated 0
or 0
approved 0
of 0
any 0
violence. 0

The 0
UK 0
Home 0
Office 0
meant 0
that 0
our 0
visit 0
could 0

violence 0
from 0
Muslims. 0

They 1
were 1
bowing 1
to 1
jihadist 1
intimidation. 1

Meanwhile, 1
Britain 1
has 1
a 1
steadily 1
lengthening 1
record 1
of 1
admitting 1
jihad 1
preachers 1
without 1
a 1
moment 1
of 1
hesitation. 1

that 0
he 0
was 0
banned 0
from 0

said: 0
“If 1
there’s 1
homosexual 1
men, 1
the 1
punishment 1
is 1
one 1
of 1
five 1
things. 1

One 1
– 1
the 1
easiest 1
one 1
maybe 1
– 1
chop 1
their 1
head 1
off, 1
that’s 1
the 1
easiest. 1

Second 1
– 1
burn 1
them 1
to 1
death. 1

Third 1
– 1
throw 1
’em 1
off 1
a 1
cliff. 1

Fourth 1
– 1
tear 1
down 1
a 1
wall 1
on 1
them 1
so 1
they 1
die 1
under 1
that. 1

Fifth 1
– 1
a 1
combination 1
of 1
the 1
above.” 1

Theresa 0
