Pamela 0 70 2
Geller 0 70 2
and 0 70 2
I 0 70 2
are 0 70 2
banned 0 70 2
from 0 70 2
entering 0 70 2
the 0 70 2
country 0 70 2
for 0 70 2
the 0 70 2
crime 0 70 2
of 0 70 2
telling 0 70 2
the 0 70 2
truth 0 70 2
about 0 70 2
Islam 0 70 2
and 0 70 2
jihad. 0 70 2

According 0 70 3
to 0 70 3
Breitbart, 0 70 3
“Sellner, 0 70 3
who 0 70 3
described 0 70 3
the 0 70 3
detention 0 70 3
centre 0 70 3
as 0 70 3
looking 0 70 3
akin 0 70 3
to 0 70 3
a 0 70 3
typical 0 70 3
American 0 70 3
prison, 0 70 3
said 0 70 3
he 1 70 3
was 1 70 3
told 1 70 3
by 1 70 3
authorities 1 70 3
that 1 70 3
his 1 70 3
speaking 1 70 3
at 1 70 3
Hyde 1 70 3
Park 1 70 3
could 1 70 3
cause 1 70 3
violence 1 70 3
and 1 70 3
disrupt 1 70 3
community 1 70 3
cohesion.” 1 70 3

That’s 1 70 4
just 1 70 4
what 1 70 4
they 1 70 4
claimed 1 70 4
about 1 70 4
Pamela 1 70 4
Geller 1 70 4
and 1 70 4
me: 1 70 4
that 1 70 4
our 1 70 4
visit 1 70 4
could 1 70 4
cause 1 70 4
violence 1 70 4
and 1 70 4
disrupt 1 70 4
community 1 70 4
cohesion. 1 70 4

But 0 70 5
we, 0 70 5
of 0 70 5
course, 0 70 5
have 0 70 5
never 0 70 5
advocated 0 70 5
or 0 70 5
approved 0 70 5
of 0 70 5
any 0 70 5
violence. 0 70 5

The 0 70 6
UK 0 70 6
Home 0 70 6
Office 0 70 6
meant 0 70 6
that 0 70 6
our 0 70 6
visit 0 70 6
could 0 70 6
cause 0 70 6
violence 0 70 6
from 0 70 6
Muslims. 0 70 6

They 1 70 7
were 1 70 7
bowing 1 70 7
to 1 70 7
jihadist 1 70 7
intimidation. 1 70 7

Meanwhile, 1 70 8
Britain 1 70 8
has 1 70 8
a 1 70 8
steadily 1 70 8
lengthening 1 70 8
record 1 70 8
of 1 70 8
admitting 1 70 8
jihad 1 70 8
preachers 1 70 8
without 1 70 8
a 1 70 8
moment 1 70 8
of 1 70 8
hesitation. 1 70 8

Syed 0 70 9
Muzaffar 0 70 9
Shah 0 70 9
Qadri’s 0 70 9
preaching 1 70 9
of 1 70 9
hatred 1 70 9
and 1 70 9
jihad 1 70 9
violence 1 70 9
was 0 70 9
so 0 70 9
hardline 0 70 9
that 0 70 9
he 0 70 9
was 0 70 9
banned 0 70 9
from 0 70 9
preaching 0 70 9
in 0 70 9
Pakistan, 0 70 9
but 0 70 9
the 0 70 9
UK 0 70 9
Home 0 70 9
Office 0 70 9
welcomed 0 70 9
him 0 70 9
into 0 70 9
Britain. 0 70 9

The 0 70 10
UK 0 70 10
Home 0 70 10
Office 0 70 10
also 0 70 10
admitted 0 70 10
Shaykh 0 70 10
Hamza 0 70 10
Sodagar 0 70 10
into 0 70 10
the 0 70 10
country, 0 70 10
despite 0 70 10
the 0 70 10
fact 0 70 10
that 0 70 10
he 0 70 10
has 0 70 10
said: 0 70 10
“If 1 70 10
there’s 1 70 10
homosexual 1 70 10
men, 1 70 10
the 1 70 10
punishment 1 70 10
is 1 70 10
one 1 70 10
of 1 70 10
five 1 70 10
things. 1 70 10

One 1 70 11
– 1 70 11
the 1 70 11
easiest 1 70 11
one 1 70 11
maybe 1 70 11
– 1 70 11
chop 1 70 11
their 1 70 11
head 1 70 11
off, 1 70 11
that’s 1 70 11
the 1 70 11
easiest. 1 70 11

Second 1 70 12
– 1 70 12
burn 1 70 12
them 1 70 12
to 1 70 12
death. 1 70 12

Third 1 70 13
– 1 70 13
throw 1 70 13
’em 1 70 13
off 1 70 13
a 1 70 13
cliff. 1 70 13

Fourth 1 70 14
– 1 70 14
tear 1 70 14
down 1 70 14
a 1 70 14
wall 1 70 14
on 1 70 14
them 1 70 14
so 1 70 14
they 1 70 14
die 1 70 14
under 1 70 14
that. 1 70 14

Fifth 1 70 15
– 1 70 15
a 1 70 15
combination 1 70 15
of 1 70 15
the 1 70 15
above.” 1 70 15

Theresa 0 70 16
May’s 0 70 16
relentlessly 1 70 16
appeasement-minded 1 70 16
government 1 70 16
also 0 70 16
admitted 0 70 16
two 0 70 16
jihad 0 70 16
preachers 0 70 16
who 0 70 16
had 0 70 16
praised 0 70 16
the 0 70 16
murderer 0 70 16
of 0 70 16
a 0 70 16
foe 0 70 16
of 0 70 16
Pakistan’s 0 70 16
blasphemy 0 70 16
laws. 0 70 16

One 0 70 17
of 0 70 17
them 0 70 17
was 0 70 17
welcomed 0 70 17
by 0 70 17
the 0 70 17
Archbishop 0 70 17
of 0 70 17
Canterbury. 0 70 17

Nor 0 70 18
does 0 70 18
the 0 70 18
UK 0 70 18
admit 0 70 18
only 0 70 18
preachers 0 70 18
of 0 70 18
jihad 0 70 18
terror. 0 70 18

It 0 70 19
admits 0 70 19
jihad 0 70 19
terrorists 0 70 19
as 0 70 19
well, 0 70 19
even 0 70 19
when 0 70 19
it 0 70 19
knows 0 70 19
they 0 70 19
are 0 70 19
jihad 0 70 19
terrorists. 0 70 19

The 0 70 20
Muslim 0 70 20
migrant 0 70 20
teen 0 70 20
who 0 70 20
bombed 0 70 20
the 0 70 20
London 0 70 20
Tube 0 70 20
told 0 70 20
border 0 70 20
officials 0 70 20
that 0 70 20
he 0 70 20
was 0 70 20
trained 0 70 20
by 0 70 20
ISIS, 0 70 20
but 0 70 20
was 0 70 20
admitted 0 70 20
anyway. 0 70 20

Meanwhile, 1 70 21
the 1 70 21
UK 1 70 21
banned 1 70 21
three 1 70 21
bishops 1 70 21
from 1 70 21
areas 1 70 21
of 1 70 21
Iraq 1 70 21
and 1 70 21
Syria 1 70 21
where 1 70 21
Christians 1 70 21
are 1 70 21
persecuted 1 70 21
from 1 70 21
entering 1 70 21
the 1 70 21
country. 1 70 21
