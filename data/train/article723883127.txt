Pope 0 427 6
Francis 0 427 6
accused 0 427 6

notorious 0 427 6

Thursday, 0 427 6
an 0 427 6
astonishing 0 427 6
end 0 427 6
to 0 427 6

Francis 0 427 7
said 0 427 7
that 0 427 7
until 0 427 7
he 0 427 7
sees 0 427 7
proof 0 427 7
that 0 427 7
Bishop 0 427 7
Juan 0 427 7
Barros 0 427 7
was 0 427 7
complicit 0 427 7
in 0 427 7
covering 0 427 7
up 0 427 7
the 0 427 7

crimes 0 427 7
of 0 427 7
the 0 427 7
Rev. 0 427 7

Fernando 0 427 8
Karadima, 0 427 8
such 0 427 8
accusations 0 427 8
against 0 427 8
Barros 0 427 8
are 0 427 8
“all 1 427 8
calumny.” 1 427 8
The 0 427 8
pope’s 0 427 8
remarks 0 427 8
drew 0 427 8
shock 1 427 8
from 0 427 8
Chileans 0 427 8
and 0 427 8
immediate 0 427 8
rebuke 0 427 8
from 0 427 8
victims 0 427 8
and 0 427 8
their 0 427 8
advocates. 0 427 8

They 0 427 9
noted 0 427 9
the 0 427 9
accusers 0 427 9
were 0 427 9
deemed 0 427 9
credible 0 427 9
enough 0 427 9
by 0 427 9
the 0 427 9
Vatican 0 427 9
that 0 427 9
it 0 427 9
sentenced 0 427 9
Karadima 0 427 9
to 0 427 9
a 0 427 9
lifetime 0 427 9
of 0 427 9
“penance 0 427 9
and 0 427 9
prayer” 0 427 9
for 0 427 9
his 0 427 9
crimes 0 427 9
in 0 427 9
2011. 0 427 9

A 0 427 10
Chilean 0 427 10
judge 0 427 10
also 0 427 10
found 0 427 10
the 0 427 10
victims 0 427 10
to 0 427 10
be 0 427 10
credible, 0 427 10
saying 0 427 10
that 0 427 10
while 0 427 10
she 0 427 10
had 0 427 10
to 0 427 10
drop 0 427 10
criminal 0 427 10
charges 0 427 10
against 0 427 10
Karadima 0 427 10
because 0 427 10
too 0 427 10
much 0 427 10
time 0 427 10
had 0 427 10
passed, 0 427 10
proof 0 427 10
of 0 427 10
his 0 427 10
crimes 0 427 10
wasn’t 0 427 10
lacking. 0 427 10

[…] 0 427 11
The 0 427 11
Karadima 0 427 11
scandal 0 427 11
dominated 0 427 11
Francis’ 0 427 11
visit 0 427 11
to 0 427 11
Chile 0 427 11
and 0 427 11
the 0 427 11
overall 0 427 11
issue 0 427 11
of 0 427 11
sex 0 427 11
abuse 0 427 11
and 0 427 11
church 0 427 11
cover-up 0 427 11
was 0 427 11
likely 0 427 11
to 0 427 11
factor 0 427 11
into 0 427 11
his 0 427 11
three-day 0 427 11
trip 0 427 11
to 0 427 11
Peru 0 427 11
that 0 427 11
began 0 427 11
late 0 427 11
Thursday. 0 427 11

Karadima’s 0 427 12
victims 0 427 12
reported 0 427 12
to 0 427 12
church 0 427 12
authorities 0 427 12
as 0 427 12
early 0 427 12
as 0 427 12
2002 0 427 12
that 0 427 12
he 0 427 12
would 0 427 12
kiss 1 427 12
and 1 427 12
fondle 1 427 12
them 1 427 12
in 1 427 12
the 1 427 12
swank 1 427 12
Santiago 0 427 12
parish 0 427 12
he 0 427 12
ran, 0 427 12
but 0 427 12
officials 0 427 12
refused 0 427 12
to 0 427 12
believe 0 427 12
them. 0 427 12

Only 0 427 13
when 0 427 13
the 0 427 13
victims 0 427 13
went 0 427 13
public 0 427 13
with 0 427 13
their 0 427 13
accusations 0 427 13
in 0 427 13
2010 0 427 13
did 0 427 13
the 0 427 13
Vatican 0 427 13
launch 0 427 13
an 0 427 13
investigation 0 427 13
that 0 427 13
led 0 427 13
to 0 427 13
Karadima 0 427 13
being 0 427 13
removed 0 427 13
from 0 427 13
ministry. 0 427 13

The 0 427 14
emeritus 0 427 14
archbishop 0 427 14
of 0 427 14
Santiago 0 427 14
subsequently 0 427 14
apologized 0 427 14
for 0 427 14
having 0 427 14
refused 0 427 14
to 0 427 14
believe 0 427 14
the 0 427 14
victims 0 427 14
from 0 427 14
the 0 427 14
start. 0 427 14

One 0 427 15
of 0 427 15
the 0 427 15
victims 0 427 15
made 0 427 15
clear 0 427 15
his 0 427 15
disgust 0 427 15
at 0 427 15
Pope 0 427 15
Francis 0 427 15
for 0 427 15
essentially 0 427 15
covering 0 427 15
up 0 427 15
for 0 427 15
a 0 427 15
man 0 427 15
who 0 427 15
watched 0 427 15
as 0 427 15
another 0 427 15
bishop 0 427 15
sexually 0 427 15
abused 0 427 15
him. 0 427 15

“As 0 427 16
if 0 427 16
I 0 427 16
could 0 427 16
have 0 427 16
taken 0 427 16
a 0 427 16
selfie 0 427 16
or 0 427 16
a 0 427 16
photo 0 427 16
while 0 427 16
Karadima 0 427 16
abused 0 427 16
me 0 427 16
and 0 427 16
others 0 427 16
and 0 427 16
Juan 0 427 16
Barros 0 427 16
stood 0 427 16
by 0 427 16
watching 0 427 16
it 0 427 16
all,” 0 427 16
tweeted 0 427 16
Juan 0 427 16
Carlos 0 427 16
Cruz. 0 427 16

“These 1 427 17
people 1 427 17
are 1 427 17
truly 1 427 17
crazy, 1 427 17
and 0 427 17
the 0 427 17
pontiff 0 427 17
talks 0 427 17
about 0 427 17
atonement 0 427 17
to 0 427 17
the 0 427 17
victims. 0 427 17

Nothing 0 427 18
has 0 427 18
changed, 0 427 18
and 0 427 18
his 0 427 18
plea 0 427 18
for 0 427 18
forgiveness 0 427 18
is 0 427 18
empty.” 0 427 18

This 0 427 19
obviously 0 427 19
does 0 427 19
not 0 427 19
look 0 427 19
good 0 427 19
for 0 427 19
the 0 427 19
Pope 0 427 19
or 0 427 19
the 0 427 19
Catholic 0 427 19
Church 0 427 19
as 0 427 19
they 0 427 19
are 0 427 19
now 0 427 19
apparently 0 427 19
engaging 0 427 19
in 0 427 19
attacking 0 427 19
the 0 427 19
victims 0 427 19
instead 0 427 19
of 0 427 19
actually 0 427 19
going 0 427 19
after 0 427 19
the 0 427 19
abusers. 0 427 19
