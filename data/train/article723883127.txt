That’s 0

defending 0

of 0

Thursday, 0
an 0

meant 0

that 0
has 0
cost 0
the 0

Church 0
its 0
credibility 0
in 0

country. 0

Francis 0
said 0
that 0
until 0
he 0
sees 0
proof 0
that 0
Bishop 0
Juan 0
Barros 0
was 0
complicit 0
in 0
covering 0
up 0
the 0
sex 0
crimes 0
of 0
the 0
Rev. 0

Fernando 0
Karadima, 0
such 0
accusations 0
against 0
Barros 0
are 0
“all 1
calumny.” 1
The 0
pope’s 0
remarks 0
drew 0
shock 1
from 0
Chileans 0
and 0
immediate 0
rebuke 0
from 0
victims 0
and 0
their 0
advocates. 0

They 0
noted 0
the 0
accusers 0
were 0
deemed 0
credible 0
enough 0
by 0
the 0
Vatican 0
that 0
it 0
sentenced 0
Karadima 0
to 0
a 0
lifetime 0
of 0
“penance 0
and 0
prayer” 0
for 0
his 0
crimes 0
in 0
2011. 0

A 0
Chilean 0
judge 0
also 0
found 0
the 0
victims 0
to 0
be 0
credible, 0
saying 0
that 0
while 0
she 0
had 0
to 0
drop 0
criminal 0
charges 0
against 0
Karadima 0
because 0
too 0
much 0
time 0
had 0
passed, 0
proof 0
of 0
his 0
crimes 0
wasn’t 0
lacking. 0

[…] 0
The 0
Karadima 0
scandal 0
dominated 0
Francis’ 0
visit 0
to 0
Chile 0
and 0
the 0
overall 0
issue 0
of 0
sex 0
abuse 0
and 0
church 0
cover-up 0
was 0
likely 0
to 0
factor 0
into 0
his 0
three-day 0
trip 0
to 0
Peru 0
that 0
began 0
late 0
Thursday. 0

Karadima’s 0
victims 0
reported 0
to 0
church 0
authorities 0
as 0
early 0
as 0
2002 0
that 0
he 0
would 0
kiss 1
and 1
fondle 1
them 1
in 1
the 1
swank 1
Santiago 0
parish 0
he 0
ran, 0
but 0
officials 0
refused 0
to 0
believe 0
them. 0

Only 0
when 0
the 0
victims 0
went 0
public 0
with 0
their 0
accusations 0
in 0
2010 0
did 0
the 0
Vatican 0
launch 0
an 0
investigation 0
that 0
led 0
to 0
Karadima 0
being 0
removed 0
from 0
ministry. 0

The 0
emeritus 0
archbishop 0
of 0
Santiago 0
subsequently 0
apologized 0
for 0
having 0
refused 0
to 0
believe 0
the 0
victims 0
from 0
the 0
start. 0

One 0
of 0
the 0
victims 0
made 0
clear 0
his 0
disgust 0
at 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
for 0
essentially 0
covering 0
up 0
for 0
a 0
man 0
who 0
watched 0
as 0
another 0
bishop 0
sexually 0
abused 0
him. 0

“As 0
if 0
I 0
could 0
have 0
taken 0
a 0
selfie 0
or 0
a 0
photo 0
while 0
Karadima 0
abused 0
me 0
and 0
others 0
and 0
Juan 0
Barros 0
stood 0
by 0
watching 0
it 0
all,” 0
tweeted 0
Juan 0
Carlos 0
Cruz. 0

“These 1
people 1
are 1
truly 1
crazy, 1
and 0
the 0
pontiff 0
talks 0
about 0
atonement 0
to 0
the 0
victims. 0

Nothing 0
has 0
changed, 0
and 0
his 0
plea 0
for 0
forgiveness 0
is 0
empty.” 0

This 0
obviously 0
does 0
not 0
look 0
good 0
for 0
the 0
Pope 0
or 0
the 0
Catholic 0
Church 0
as 0
they 0
are 0
now 0
apparently 0
engaging 0
in 0
attacking 0
the 0
victims 0
instead 0
of 0
actually 0
going 0
after 0
the 0
abusers. 0
