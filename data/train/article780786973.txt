Trump 0 325 2
alleged 0 325 2
in 0 325 2
a 0 325 2
morning 0 325 2
tweet 0 325 2
series 0 325 2
that 0 325 2
the 0 325 2

director 0 325 2
is 0 325 2
“Disgraced 1 325 2
and 1 325 2
discredited,” 1 325 2
claiming 0 325 2
his 1 325 2
staff 1 325 2
amounts 1 325 2
to 1 325 2
nothing 1 325 2
more 1 325 2
than 1 325 2
a 1 325 2
“group 1 325 2
of 1 325 2
Angry 1 325 2

That 0 325 3
came 0 325 3
hours 0 325 3
after 0 325 3
a 0 325 3
Sunday 0 325 3

on 0 325 4
Mueller 0 325 4
and 0 325 4
his 0 325 4
team 0 325 4

his 0 325 4

more 0 325 4
than 0 325 4
one 0 325 4

Trump 0 325 5
contends 0 325 5
he 0 325 5
signed 0 325 5
off 0 325 5
on 0 325 5

however, 0 325 5
told 0 325 5
CNN 0 325 5
Monday 0 325 5
morning 0 325 5
that 0 325 5
a 0 325 5
sitting 0 325 5
White 0 325 5
House 0 325 5
counsel 0 325 5
would 0 325 5
be 0 325 5
required 0 325 5
to 0 325 5
fully 0 325 5
cooperate 0 325 5
with 0 325 5
a 0 325 5
federal 0 325 5
investigation 0 325 5
because 0 325 5
he 0 325 5
is 0 325 5
a 0 325 5
government 0 325 5
lawyer, 0 325 5
not 0 325 5
a 0 325 5
president’s 0 325 5

attorney. 0 325 5

But 0 325 6
Trump 0 325 6
on 0 325 6
Monday 0 325 6
morning 0 325 6
tweeted 0 325 6
that 0 325 6
McGahn 0 325 6
spoke 0 325 6
with 0 325 6
the 0 325 6
special 0 325 6
counsel 0 325 6
team 0 325 6
for 0 325 6
“over 0 325 6

approval, 0 325 6
for 0 325 6
purposes 0 325 6
of 0 325 6
transparency.” 0 325 6
(The 1 325 6
tweet 1 325 6
included 1 325 6
a 1 325 6
misspelling 1 325 6
of 1 325 6
“counsel.”) 1 325 6

The 0 325 7
length 0 325 7
of 0 325 7
the 0 325 7
Mueller-McGahn 0 325 7
sessions 0 325 7
led 0 325 7
Trump 0 325 7
to 0 325 7
the 0 325 7
conclusion 0 325 7
the 0 325 7
special 0 325 7
counsel 0 325 7
is 0 325 7
“looking 1 325 7
for 1 325 7
trouble” 1 325 7
because 0 325 7
they 0 325 7
“they 1 325 7
know 1 325 7
there 1 325 7
is 1 325 7
no 1 325 7
Russian 1 325 7
Collusion.” 1 325 7

But 0 325 8
Mueller 0 325 8
reportedly 0 325 8
is 0 325 8
keenly 0 325 8
interested 0 325 8
in 0 325 8
a 0 325 8
widely 0 325 8

June 0 325 8

arranged 0 325 8
by 0 325 8
Donald 0 325 8
Trump 0 325 8
Jr., 0 325 8
which 0 325 8
included 0 325 8
a 0 325 8
Russian 0 325 8
attorney 0 325 8
who 0 325 8
promised 0 325 8

The 0 325 9
session 0 325 9
also 0 325 9
was 0 325 9
attended 0 325 9
by 0 325 9
then-campaign 0 325 9
chairman 0 325 9
Paul 0 325 9
Manafort 0 325 9
and 0 325 9
Trump 0 325 9
son-in-law 0 325 9
Jared 0 325 9
Kushner; 0 325 9
the 1 325 9
president 1 325 9
dictated 1 325 9
a 1 325 9
misleading 1 325 9
statement 1 325 9
about 1 325 9
it 1 325 9
a 1 325 9
year 1 325 9
later 1 325 9
and 1 325 9
it 1 325 9
remains 1 325 9
murky 1 325 9
just 1 325 9
when 1 325 9
he 1 325 9
learned 1 325 9
about 1 325 9
the 1 325 9
meeting. 1 325 9

As 0 325 10
Roll 0 325 10
Call 0 325 10
has 0 325 10
reported, 0 325 10
Trump 0 325 10
was 0 325 10
in 0 325 10
the 0 325 10
tower 0 325 10
at 0 325 10
the 0 325 10
time 0 325 10
of 0 325 10
the 0 325 10
session 0 325 10
with 0 325 10
the 0 325 10
Russian 0 325 10
lawyer. 0 325 10

The 0 325 11
president 0 325 11
also 0 325 11
continued 0 325 11
to 0 325 11
push 0 325 11
a 0 325 11
line 0 325 11
first 1 325 11
floated 1 325 11
by 0 325 11
his 0 325 11
attorney, 0 325 11
former 0 325 11
New 0 325 11
York 0 325 11
mayor 0 325 11
and 0 325 11
U.S. 0 325 11
attorney 0 325 11
Rudolph 0 325 11
Giuliani, 0 325 11
tweeting 0 325 11
that 0 325 11
campaign 0 325 11
collusion 0 325 11
with 0 325 11
Russia 0 325 11
would 0 325 11
be 0 325 11
a 1 325 11
“phony 1 325 11
crime.” 1 325 11
He’s 0 325 11
right, 0 325 11
there 0 325 11
is 0 325 11
no 0 325 11
specific 0 325 11
collusion 0 325 11
statute. 0 325 11

But 1 325 12
legal 1 325 12
experts 1 325 12
say 1 325 12
anyone 1 325 12
in 1 325 12
Trump’s 1 325 12
orbit 1 325 12
would 1 325 12
be 1 325 12
charged 1 325 12
with 1 325 12
conspiracy, 1 325 12
making 1 325 12
false 1 325 12
statements 1 325 12
to 1 325 12
federal 1 325 12
investigators 1 325 12
or 1 325 12
obstructing 1 325 12
justice. 1 325 12

All 1 325 13
are 1 325 13
federal 1 325 13
crimes. 1 325 13

Trump 1 325 14
also 1 325 14
continued 1 325 14
to 1 325 14
cast 1 325 14
himself 1 325 14
as 1 325 14
a 1 325 14
victim 1 325 14
in 1 325 14
the 1 325 14
matter, 1 325 14
saying 1 325 14
when 1 325 14
he 1 325 14
attempts 1 325 14
to 1 325 14
“FIGHT 1 325 14
BACK 1 325 14
or 1 325 14
say 1 325 14
anything 1 325 14
bad 1 325 14
about 1 325 14
the 1 325 14
Rigged 1 325 14

Hunt,” 1 325 14
his 1 325 14
critics 1 325 14
“scream 1 325 14
Obstruction!” 1 325 14

Mueller 0 325 15
also 0 325 15
is 0 325 15
looking 0 325 15
at 0 325 15
whether 0 325 15
some 0 325 15
of 0 325 15
Trump’s 0 325 15
