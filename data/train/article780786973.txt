that 0 127 5
a 0 127 5

cooperate 0 127 5
with 0 127 5
a 0 127 5
federal 0 127 5
investigation 0 127 5

he 0 127 5
is 0 127 5
a 0 127 5
government 0 127 5

But 0 127 6
Trump 0 127 6
on 0 127 6
Monday 0 127 6
morning 0 127 6
tweeted 0 127 6
that 0 127 6
McGahn 0 127 6
spoke 0 127 6
with 0 127 6
the 0 127 6
special 0 127 6

(The 1 127 6

misspelling 1 127 6

The 0 127 7
length 0 127 7
of 0 127 7
the 0 127 7
Mueller-McGahn 0 127 7
sessions 0 127 7
led 0 127 7
Trump 0 127 7
to 0 127 7
the 0 127 7
conclusion 0 127 7
the 0 127 7
special 0 127 7
counsel 0 127 7
is 0 127 7
“looking 1 127 7
for 1 127 7
trouble” 1 127 7
because 0 127 7
they 0 127 7
“they 1 127 7

But 0 127 8
Mueller 0 127 8
reportedly 0 127 8
is 0 127 8
keenly 0 127 8
interested 0 127 8

included 0 127 8
a 0 127 8
Russian 0 127 8

The 0 127 9
session 0 127 9
also 0 127 9
was 0 127 9

by 0 127 9

son-in-law 0 127 9
Jared 0 127 9
Kushner; 0 127 9
the 1 127 9
president 1 127 9
dictated 1 127 9
a 1 127 9
misleading 1 127 9
statement 1 127 9
about 1 127 9
it 1 127 9
a 1 127 9
year 1 127 9
later 1 127 9
and 1 127 9
it 1 127 9
remains 1 127 9
murky 1 127 9
just 1 127 9
when 1 127 9
he 1 127 9
learned 1 127 9
about 1 127 9
the 1 127 9
meeting. 1 127 9

As 0 127 10
Roll 0 127 10
Call 0 127 10
has 0 127 10
reported, 0 127 10
Trump 0 127 10
was 0 127 10
in 0 127 10
the 0 127 10
tower 0 127 10
at 0 127 10
the 0 127 10
time 0 127 10
of 0 127 10
the 0 127 10
session 0 127 10
with 0 127 10
the 0 127 10
Russian 0 127 10
lawyer. 0 127 10

The 0 127 11
president 0 127 11
also 0 127 11
continued 0 127 11
to 0 127 11
push 0 127 11
a 0 127 11
line 0 127 11
first 1 127 11
floated 1 127 11
by 0 127 11
his 0 127 11
attorney, 0 127 11
former 0 127 11
New 0 127 11
York 0 127 11
mayor 0 127 11
and 0 127 11
U.S. 0 127 11
attorney 0 127 11
Rudolph 0 127 11
Giuliani, 0 127 11
tweeting 0 127 11
that 0 127 11
campaign 0 127 11
collusion 0 127 11
with 0 127 11
Russia 0 127 11
would 0 127 11
be 0 127 11
a 1 127 11
“phony 1 127 11
crime.” 1 127 11
He’s 0 127 11
right, 0 127 11
there 0 127 11
is 0 127 11
no 0 127 11
specific 0 127 11
collusion 0 127 11
statute. 0 127 11

But 1 127 12
legal 1 127 12
experts 1 127 12
say 1 127 12
anyone 1 127 12
in 1 127 12
Trump’s 1 127 12
orbit 1 127 12
would 1 127 12
be 1 127 12
charged 1 127 12
with 1 127 12
conspiracy, 1 127 12
making 1 127 12
false 1 127 12
statements 1 127 12
to 1 127 12
federal 1 127 12
investigators 1 127 12
or 1 127 12
obstructing 1 127 12
justice. 1 127 12

All 1 127 13
are 1 127 13
federal 1 127 13
crimes. 1 127 13

Trump 1 127 14
also 1 127 14
continued 1 127 14
to 1 127 14
cast 1 127 14
himself 1 127 14
as 1 127 14
a 1 127 14
victim 1 127 14
in 1 127 14
the 1 127 14
matter, 1 127 14
saying 1 127 14
when 1 127 14
he 1 127 14
attempts 1 127 14
to 1 127 14
“FIGHT 1 127 14
BACK 1 127 14
or 1 127 14
say 1 127 14
anything 1 127 14
bad 1 127 14
about 1 127 14
the 1 127 14

Hunt,” 1 127 14
his 1 127 14
critics 1 127 14
“scream 1 127 14
Obstruction!” 1 127 14

Mueller 0 127 15
also 0 127 15
is 0 127 15
looking 0 127 15
at 0 127 15
whether 0 127 15
