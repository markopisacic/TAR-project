are 0 73 8
equally 0 73 8

Very 0 73 10
little 0 73 10

And 0 73 11
perhaps 0 73 11
most 0 73 11
telling 0 73 11
of 0 73 11
all, 0 73 11
not 0 73 11
one 0 73 11

hour. 0 73 11

Nothing 0 73 12
is 0 73 12

of 0 73 12
increased 0 73 12
intensity 0 73 12

of 0 73 12

foundress 0 73 12
or 0 73 12
returning 0 73 12
to 0 73 12
sources, 0 73 12
still 1 73 12
less 1 73 12
of 0 73 12

the 0 73 12
Carmelites’ 0 73 12

Indeed, 0 73 13
in 0 73 13
one 0 73 13
case 0 73 13
in 0 73 13
Spain, 0 73 13
the 0 73 13

altogether. 0 73 13

last 0 73 14
40 0 73 14

There 0 73 15
have 0 73 15
been 0 73 15
two 0 73 15
amalgamations 0 73 15
in 0 73 15

monastery 0 73 16
as 0 73 16
a 0 73 16
temporary 0 73 16
measure.” 0 73 16

The 0 73 17
case 0 73 17
of 0 73 17
the 0 73 17
Netherlands 0 73 17
is 0 73 17
downright 1 73 17
bizarre; 1 73 17
sisters 0 73 17
so 0 73 17
old 0 73 17
that 0 73 17
even 0 73 17
the 0 73 17
federation 0 73 17
structures 0 73 17
are 0 73 17
breaking 0 73 17
down. 0 73 17

Only 0 73 18
one 0 73 18
fully 0 73 18
autonomous 0 73 18
functioning 0 73 18
Carmel 0 73 18
still 0 73 18
exists 0 73 18
in 0 73 18
the 0 73 18
Netherlands, 0 73 18
and 0 73 18
the 0 73 18

religious 0 73 18
brothers. 0 73 18

But 0 73 19
in 0 73 19
this 0 73 19
situation, 0 73 19
the 0 73 19
“solution” 0 73 19
undertaken 0 73 19
has 0 73 19
been 0 73 19
an 0 73 19
elaborate 0 73 19
bureaucratic 0 73 19
reshuffle, 0 73 19
including 0 73 19
gaining 0 73 19
approval 0 73 19
from 0 73 19
Rome, 0 73 19
for 0 73 19
“a 0 73 19
completely 0 73 19
new 0 73 19
structure,” 0 73 19
whose 0 73 19
main 0 73 19
task, 0 73 19
no 0 73 19
doubt, 0 73 19
will 0 73 19
be 0 73 19
the 0 73 19
making 0 73 19
of 0 73 19

The 0 73 20
atmosphere 0 73 20
is 0 73 20
weirdly 0 73 20

– 0 73 20
one 0 73 20

simply 0 73 20
“forgetting 0 73 20
the 0 73 20
numbers” 0 73 20
– 0 73 20
with 0 73 20
many 0 73 20
notes 0 73 20
of 0 73 20
mutual 0 73 20

over 0 73 20
“unity,” 0 73 20
the 0 73 20
creating 0 73 20
of 0 73 20

and 0 73 20
the 0 73 20
“building 0 73 20

The 0 73 21
report 0 73 21

formation 0 73 21
for 0 73 21
11 0 73 21
monasteries 0 73 21
– 0 73 21
states 0 73 21
tersely 0 73 21
that 0 73 21
their 0 73 21
biggest 0 73 21
problem 0 73 21
is 0 73 21
“ageing” 0 73 21
but 0 73 21
under 0 73 21
“possible 0 73 21
solutions” 0 73 21
says 0 73 21
only, 0 73 21
“We 0 73 21
want 0 73 21
to 0 73 21
continue 0 73 21
along 0 73 21
the 0 73 21
path 0 73 21
we 0 73 21
have 0 73 21
begun.” 0 73 21

It 0 73 22
is 0 73 22
only 0 73 22
in 0 73 22
the 0 73 22
report 0 73 22
from 0 73 22
Croatia 0 73 22
where 0 73 22
the 0 73 22
problem 0 73 22
changes 0 73 22
abruptly 0 73 22
from 0 73 22
aging 0 73 22
nuns 0 73 22
and 0 73 22
no 0 73 22
vocations 0 73 22
to 0 73 22
too 0 73 22
many 0 73 22
vocations 0 73 22
with 0 73 22
not 0 73 22
enough 0 73 22
room[2]. 0 73 22

It 0 73 23
is 0 73 23
also 0 73 23
notable 0 73 23
that 0 73 23
it 0 73 23
is 0 73 23
only 0 73 23
in 0 73 23
the 0 73 23
Croatian 0 73 23
report 0 73 23
that 0 73 23
Christ 0 73 23
gets 0 73 23
a 0 73 23
direct 0 73 23
mention. 0 73 23

Federation 0 73 24
of 0 73 24
Croatia 0 73 24
& 0 73 24
Bosnia-Herzegovina: 0 73 24
82 0 73 24
nuns 0 73 24
in 0 73 24
5 0 73 24
convents, 0 73 24
with 0 73 24
an 0 73 24
average 0 73 24
age 0 73 24
of 0 73 24
47, 0 73 24
and 0 73 24
eleven 0 73 24
in 0 73 24
formation. 0 73 24

This 0 73 25
outlier 0 73 25
differs 0 73 25
from 0 73 25
the 0 73 25
Western 0 73 25
European 0 73 25
federations 0 73 25
in 0 73 25
several 0 73 25
respects, 0 73 25
notably 0 73 25
that 0 73 25
it 0 73 25
was 0 73 25
only 0 73 25
federated 0 73 25
in 0 73 25
2002. 0 73 25

But 0 73 26
the 0 73 26
effects 0 73 26
of 0 73 26
the 0 73 26
federating/formation 0 73 26
courses 0 73 26
are 0 73 26
already 0 73 26
being 0 73 26
felt: 0 73 26
“Nowadays, 0 73 26
two 0 73 26
monasteries 0 73 26
have 0 73 26
difficulty 0 73 26
because 0 73 26
of 0 73 26
a 0 73 26
lack 0 73 26
of 0 73 26
vocations.” 0 73 26

Path 0 73 27
taken: 0 73 27
Have 0 73 27
made 0 73 27
a 0 73 27
foundation 0 73 27
in 0 73 27
Albania; 0 73 27
however 0 73 27
this 0 73 27
community 0 73 27
is 0 73 27
not 0 73 27
federated. 0 73 27

From 0 73 28
the 0 73 28
beginning, 0 73 28
our 0 73 28
Association 0 73 28
has 0 73 28
organized 0 73 28
formation 0 73 28
courses 0 73 28
for 0 73 28
the 0 73 28
younger 0 73 28
sisters 0 73 28
as 0 73 28
well 0 73 28
as 0 73 28
courses 0 73 28
of 0 73 28
permanent 0 73 28
formation. 0 73 28

Each 0 73 29

two 0 73 33

the 0 73 94
really 0 73 94

this 0 73 127
has 0 73 127
not 0 73 127

With 0 73 143
the 0 73 143
passing 0 73 143

the 0 73 143

We 0 73 147
are 0 73 147
left 0 73 147
with 0 73 147
the 0 73 147
problem 0 73 147
that 0 73 147
in 0 73 147
the 0 73 147

there 0 73 147
are 0 73 147
no 0 73 147

now 0 73 148
is 0 73 148
thus 0 73 148
no 0 73 148

possible. 0 73 148

Possible 0 73 149
solutions: 0 73 149
The 0 73 149

on 0 73 149
a 0 73 149

been 0 73 149
constantly 0 73 149
kept 0 73 149
in 0 73 149
mind. 0 73 149

We 0 73 150
began 0 73 150
from 0 73 150
three 0 73 150
points: 0 73 150

1)Maintenance 0 73 151
of 0 73 151
the 0 73 151
formal 0 73 151
autonomy 0 73 151
of 0 73 151
the 0 73 151
Carmels 0 73 151
that 0 73 151
still 0 73 151
exist, 0 73 151
but 0 73 151
with 0 73 151
the 0 73 151
chance 0 73 151
to 0 73 151
transfer 0 73 151
tasks 0 73 151
gradually 0 73 151
to 0 73 151
the 0 73 151
council 0 73 151
of 0 73 151
the 0 73 151
Federation. 0 73 151

2)Appointment 0 73 152
of 0 73 152
The 0 73 152
Federal 0 73 152
board 0 73 152
or 0 73 152
Federal 0 73 152
Council 0 73 152
of 0 73 152
the 0 73 152
Federation, 0 73 152
preferably 0 73 152
appointed 0 73 152
by 0 73 152
the 0 73 152
Superior 0 73 152
General. 0 73 152

The 0 73 153
team 0 73 153
will 0 73 153
consist 0 73 153
of 0 73 153
a 0 73 153
president 0 73 153
and 0 73 153
vice-president 0 73 153
who 0 73 153
are 0 73 153
members 0 73 153
of 0 73 153
one 0 73 153
of 0 73 153
the 0 73 153
convents, 0 73 153
appointed 0 73 153
to 0 73 153
functions, 0 73 153
and 0 73 153
of 0 73 153
three 0 73 153
people 0 73 153
who 0 73 153
are 0 73 153
members, 0 73 153
or 0 73 153
not, 0 73 153
of 0 73 153
one 0 73 153
of 0 73 153
the 0 73 153
convents. 0 73 153

3)A 0 73 154
Supervisory 0 73 154
council, 0 73 154
also 0 73 154
to 0 73 154
be 0 73 154
appointed 0 73 154
periodically 0 73 154
by 0 73 154
the 0 73 154
Superior 0 73 154
General, 0 73 154
which 0 73 154
will 0 73 154
be 0 73 154
made 0 73 154
up 0 73 154
of 0 73 154
three 0 73 154
members, 0 73 154
whose 0 73 154
president 0 73 154
will 0 73 154
be, 0 73 154
preferably, 0 73 154
a 0 73 154
member 0 73 154
of 0 73 154
a 0 73 154
religious 0 73 154
institute, 0 73 154
preferably 0 73 154
of 0 73 154
the 0 73 154
Carmelite 0 73 154
Order 0 73 154
and 0 73 154
appointed 0 73 154
to 0 73 154
functions. 0 73 154

This 0 73 155
council 0 73 155
sees 0 73 155
itself 0 73 155
as 0 73 155
a 0 73 155
supervisory 0 73 155
body 0 73 155
and 0 73 155
to 0 73 155
give 0 73 155
advice 0 73 155
that 0 73 155
will 0 73 155
more 0 73 155
or 0 73 155
less 0 73 155
replace 0 73 155
the 0 73 155

2008, 0 73 156
the 0 73 156

were 0 73 156
in 0 73 156
Rome 0 73 156
where 0 73 156
they 0 73 156
explained 0 73 156
the 0 73 156
proposals. 0 73 156

They 0 73 157
had 0 73 157
meetings 0 73 157
with 0 73 157
Fr. 0 73 157

General 0 73 158
and 0 73 158
with 0 73 158
the 0 73 158
Congregation 0 73 158
for 0 73 158
Religious. 0 73 158

These 0 73 159
were 0 73 159
open 0 73 159
meetings 0 73 159
that 0 73 159
helped 0 73 159
us 0 73 159
to 0 73 159
clarify 0 73 159
matters. 0 73 159

An 0 73 160
important 0 73 160
concern 0 73 160
was 0 73 160
that 0 73 160
they 0 73 160
would 0 73 160
allow 0 73 160
us 0 73 160
to 0 73 160
use 0 73 160
lay 0 73 160
people 0 73 160
on 0 73 160
the 0 73 160
Federal 0 73 160
Council 0 73 160
of 0 73 160
the 0 73 160
Federation 0 73 160
and 0 73 160
the 0 73 160
Supervisory 0 73 160
council. 0 73 160

We 0 73 161
were 0 73 161
aware 0 73 161
that 0 73 161
we 0 73 161
were 0 73 161
not 0 73 161
dealing 0 73 161
with 0 73 161
a 0 73 161
simple 0 73 161
matter, 0 73 161
but 0 73 161
we 0 73 161
think 0 73 161
that, 0 73 161
in 0 73 161
view 0 73 161
of 0 73 161
our 0 73 161
present 0 73 161
situation 0 73 161
today, 0 73 161
we 0 73 161
do 0 73 161
not 0 73 161
have 0 73 161
much 0 73 161
choice. 0 73 161

It 0 73 162
is 0 73 162
important 0 73 162
to 0 73 162
continue 0 73 162
to 0 73 162
protect 0 73 162
the 0 73 162
interests 0 73 162
of 0 73 162
our 0 73 162
Federation 0 73 162
in 0 73 162
the 0 73 162
most 0 73 162
responsible 0 73 162
and 0 73 162
careful 0 73 162
way, 0 73 162
so 0 73 162
that 0 73 162
all 0 73 162
the 0 73 162
sisters, 0 73 162
even 0 73 162
those 0 73 162
advanced 0 73 162
in 0 73 162
years, 0 73 162
can 0 73 162
continue 0 73 162
to 0 73 162
live 0 73 162
their 0 73 162
life 0 73 162
in 0 73 162
Carmel. 0 73 162

Definitive 0 73 163
permission 0 73 163
came 0 73 163
at 0 73 163
the 0 73 163
25th 0 73 163
of 0 73 163
February. 0 73 163

~~~ 0 73 164

Given 0 73 165
this 0 73 165
incredible 1 73 165
picture 0 73 165
of 0 73 165
a 0 73 165
Carmelite 0 73 165
Order 0 73 165
in 0 73 165
the 0 73 165
last 0 73 165
rattle 0 73 165
of 0 73 165
its 0 73 165
death 1 73 165
throes, 1 73 165
the 0 73 165
rest 0 73 165
of 0 73 165
the 0 73 165
summaries 0 73 165
of 0 73 165
speeches 0 73 165
given 0 73 165
at 0 73 165
the 0 73 165
meeting 0 73 165
in 0 73 165
Avila 0 73 165
read 0 73 165
as 0 73 165
outright 0 73 165
surreal, 0 73 165
leaving 0 73 165
us 0 73 165
to 0 73 165
wonder 0 73 165
if 0 73 165
any 0 73 165
of 0 73 165
these 0 73 165
people 0 73 165
are 0 73 165
attached 0 73 165
in 0 73 165
any 0 73 165
way 0 73 165
to 0 73 165
reality. 0 73 165

Sr. 0 73 166
Enrica 0 73 166
Rosanna, 0 73 166
the 0 73 166
representative 0 73 166
of 0 73 166
the 0 73 166
Vatican’s 0 73 166
Congregation 0 73 166
for 0 73 166
Religious 0 73 166
told 0 73 166
them 0 73 166
that 0 73 166
the 0 73 166
“two 0 73 166
great 0 73 166
challenges 0 73 166
to 0 73 166
our 0 73 166
contemplative 0 73 166
life” 0 73 166
are 0 73 166
“the 0 73 166
challenge 0 73 166
of 0 73 166
globalization 0 73 166
and 0 73 166
the 0 73 166
challenge 0 73 166
of 0 73 166
irrelevancy.” 0 73 166
She 0 73 166
warned 0 73 166
the 0 73 166
nuns 0 73 166
against 0 73 166
bringing 0 73 166
vocations 0 73 166
from 0 73 166
other 0 73 166
countries 0 73 166
to 0 73 166
keep 0 73 166
their 0 73 166
monasteries 0 73 166
alive, 0 73 166
dropping 0 73 166
a 0 73 166
hint 0 73 166
about 0 73 166
what 0 73 166
now 0 73 166
seems 0 73 166
to 0 73 166
be 0 73 166
a 0 73 166
particular 0 73 166
obsession 0 73 166
of 0 73 166
the 0 73 166
Congregation. 0 73 166

Cor 0 73 167
orans 0 73 167
would 0 73 167
take 0 73 167
this 0 73 167
subject 0 73 167
up 0 73 167
definitively 0 73 167
in 0 73 167
2018: 0 73 167

The 0 73 168
nuns 0 73 168
were 0 73 168
exhorted 0 73 168
to 0 73 168
“stay 0 73 168
awake 0 73 168
to 0 73 168
welcome 0 73 168
the 0 73 168
dawn” 0 73 168
of 0 73 168
a 0 73 168
bright 0 73 168
new 0 73 168
future: 0 73 168

“These 0 73 169
are 0 73 169
difficult 0 73 169
and 0 73 169
uncertain 0 73 169
times, 0 73 169
but 0 73 169
it 0 73 169
is 0 73 169
also 0 73 169
the 0 73 169
time 0 73 169
to 0 73 169
stay 0 73 169
awake 0 73 169
as 0 73 169
the 0 73 169
new 0 73 169
dawn 0 73 169
is 0 73 169
already 0 73 169
announcing 0 73 169
itself.” 0 73 169
“Our 0 73 169
aim 0 73 169
must 0 73 169
be 0 73 169
to 0 73 169
be 0 73 169
open 0 73 169
to 0 73 169
the 0 73 169
future. 0 73 169

We 0 73 170
should 0 73 170
not 0 73 170
forget 0 73 170
that 0 73 170
we 0 73 170
are 0 73 170
following 0 73 170
in 0 73 170
the 0 73 170
tradition 0 73 170
of 0 73 170
Teresa 0 73 170
of 0 73 170
Jesus 0 73 170
and 0 73 170
in 0 73 170
the 0 73 170
tradition 0 73 170
of 0 73 170
all 0 73 170
those 0 73 170
who 0 73 170
have 0 73 170
followed 0 73 170
in 0 73 170
her 0 73 170
footsteps. 0 73 170

It 0 73 171
is 0 73 171
a 0 73 171
wide 0 73 171
road 0 73 171
that 0 73 171
opens 0 73 171
up 0 73 171
before 0 73 171
us. 0 73 171

We 0 73 172
must 0 73 172
be 0 73 172
women 0 73 172
of 0 73 172
hope 0 73 172
and 0 73 172
faith. 0 73 172

We 0 73 173
must 0 73 173
always 0 73 173
believe 0 73 173
that 0 73 173
God 0 73 173
is 0 73 173
the 0 73 173
one 0 73 173
who 0 73 173
directs 0 73 173
history. 0 73 173

From 0 73 174
this 0 73 174
derives 0 73 174
our 0 73 174
task, 0 73 174
to 0 73 174
be 0 73 174
creative 0 73 174
and, 0 73 174
at 0 73 174
the 0 73 174
same 0 73 174
time, 0 73 174
faithful 0 73 174
(creative 0 73 174
fidelity).” 0 73 174
[emphasis 0 73 174
in 0 73 174
the 0 73 174
original.] 0 73 174

While 0 73 175
there 0 73 175
can 0 73 175
be 0 73 175
no 0 73 175
doubt 0 73 175
that 0 73 175
the 0 73 175
impending 1 73 175
total 1 73 175
extinction 1 73 175
of 0 73 175
the 0 73 175
Carmelite 0 73 175
Order 0 73 175
in 0 73 175
Western 0 73 175
Europe 0 73 175
was 0 73 175
foremost 0 73 175
in 0 73 175
the 0 73 175
minds 0 73 175
of 0 73 175
the 0 73 175
nuns 0 73 175
present, 0 73 175
it 0 73 175
seems 0 73 175
that 0 73 175
the 0 73 175
issue 0 73 175
was 0 73 175
simply 0 73 175
not 0 73 175
addressed 0 73 175
out 0 73 175
loud 0 73 175
by 0 73 175
the 0 73 175
representatives 0 73 175
of 0 73 175
the 0 73 175
bureaucracy. 0 73 175

Instead, 0 73 176
Sr. 0 73 176
Enrica, 0 73 176
after 0 73 176
this 0 73 176
bizarre 0 73 176
and 0 73 176
cryptic 0 73 176
comment, 0 73 176
spoke 0 73 176
of 0 73 176
the 0 73 176
“problems 0 73 176
and 0 73 176
difficulties 0 73 176
that 0 73 176
we 0 73 176
can 0 73 176
encounter” 0 73 176
in 0 73 176
discernment 0 73 176
of 0 73 176
mostly 0 73 176
non-existent 0 73 176
vocations, 0 73 176
including 0 73 176
“consumerism, 0 73 176
modern 0 73 176
means 0 73 176
of 0 73 176
communication, 0 73 176
difficulties 0 73 176
in 0 73 176
creating 0 73 176
a 0 73 176
stable 0 73 176
personality, 0 73 176
autonomy 0 73 176
of 0 73 176
the 0 73 176
young, 0 73 176
the 0 73 176
need 0 73 176
to 0 73 176
be 0 73 176
always 0 73 176
supported, 0 73 176
the 0 73 176
ideology 0 73 176
of 0 73 176
subjectivism.” 0 73 176

What 1 73 177
are 1 73 177
these 1 73 177
people 1 73 177
smoking? 1 73 177

Given 0 73 178
that 0 73 178
this 0 73 178
was 0 73 178
three 0 73 178
years 0 73 178
or 0 73 178
more 0 73 178
from 0 73 178
the 0 73 178
abdication 0 73 178
of 0 73 178
Benedict 0 73 178
and 0 73 178
the 0 73 178
installation 0 73 178
of 0 73 178
the 0 73 178
New 0 73 178
Paradigm 0 73 178
of 0 73 178
Francis/Kasper, 0 73 178
one 0 73 178
wonders 0 73 178
what 0 73 178
this 0 73 178
“new 0 73 178
dawn” 0 73 178
was 0 73 178
actually 0 73 178
about. 0 73 178

Perhaps 0 73 179
a 0 73 179
useful 0 73 179
question 0 73 179
for 0 73 179
one 0 73 179
of 0 73 179
the 0 73 179
nuns 0 73 179
present 0 73 179
could 0 73 179
have 0 73 179
been, 0 73 179
“A 0 73 179
‘new 1 73 179
dawn’ 1 73 179
of 0 73 179
what, 0 73 179
exactly?” 0 73 179
This 0 73 179
kind 0 73 179
of 0 73 179
coded 0 73 179
language 0 73 179
has 0 73 179
been 0 73 179
popular 0 73 179
with 0 73 179
the 0 73 179
progressivist 0 73 179
faction 0 73 179
in 0 73 179
the 0 73 179
Church 0 73 179
since 0 73 179
the 0 73 179
1960s, 0 73 179
when 0 73 179
the 0 73 179
expectation 0 73 179
was 0 73 179
for 0 73 179
the 0 73 179
installation 0 73 179
of 0 73 179
a 0 73 179
totally 0 73 179
new 0 73 179
Church. 0 73 179

Was 0 73 180
Sr. 0 73 180
Enrica 0 73 180
somehow 0 73 180
anticipating 0 73 180
the 0 73 180
fulfillment 0 73 180
of 0 73 180
those 0 73 180
hippie-era 0 73 180
dreams 0 73 180
in 0 73 180
the 0 73 180
years 0 73 180
to 0 73 180
come? 0 73 180

It 0 73 181
is 0 73 181
certainly 0 73 181
clear 0 73 181
from 0 73 181
Francis’ 0 73 181
first 0 73 181
acts 0 73 181
as 0 73 181
pope 0 73 181
that 0 73 181
he 0 73 181
had 0 73 181
dealing 0 73 181
with 0 73 181
conservative 0 73 181
and 0 73 181
Traditionalist 0 73 181
nuns 0 73 181
high 0 73 181
on 0 73 181
his 0 73 181
list 0 73 181
of 0 73 181
priorities. 0 73 181

His 0 73 182
first 0 73 182
appointment, 0 73 182
no 0 73 182
more 0 73 182
than 0 73 182
three 0 73 182
weeks 0 73 182
after 0 73 182
the 0 73 182
Conclave 0 73 182
was 0 73 182
Jose 0 73 182
Rodrigues 0 73 182
Carballo, 0 73 182
the 0 73 182
Religious 0 73 182
Congregation’s 0 73 182
Secretary 0 73 182
and 0 73 182
– 0 73 182
given 0 73 182
the 0 73 182
scandal 0 73 182
that 0 73 182
erupted 0 73 182
on 0 73 182
his 0 73 182
leaving 0 73 182
them 0 73 182
– 0 73 182
the 0 73 182
financial 0 73 182
wrecking 0 73 182
ball 0 73 182
of 0 73 182
the 0 73 182
Franciscan 0 73 182
Friars 0 73 182
Minor. 0 73 182

The 0 73 183
first 0 73 183
task 0 73 183
Francis 0 73 183
gave 0 73 183
Carballo 0 73 183
was 0 73 183
the 0 73 183
demolition 1 73 183
of 0 73 183
the 0 73 183
Franciscan 0 73 183
Friars 0 73 183
of 0 73 183
the 0 73 183
Immaculate. 0 73 183

Certainly 0 73 184
this 0 73 184
record 0 73 184
of 0 73 184
the 0 73 184
European 0 73 184
Carmelites’ 0 73 184
meeting 0 73 184
is 0 73 184
jammed 0 73 184
with 0 73 184
hints 0 73 184
that 0 73 184
Cor 0 73 184

there 0 73 189

Arostegui 0 73 190
asked 0 73 190
some 0 73 190
very 0 73 190

“...We 0 73 203

We 0 73 204
perceive 0 73 204
that 0 73 204
there 0 73 204
is 0 73 204
a 0 73 204
shortage 0 73 204

We 0 73 205
do 0 73 205
not 0 73 205
want 0 73 205
new 0 73 205

rather 0 73 205
those 0 73 205

already 0 73 205
exist 0 73 205

(canonically) 0 73 205
to 0 73 205

“...We 0 73 205
are 0 73 205
also 0 73 205
concerned 0 73 205
for 0 73 205

not 0 73 205

Maybe 0 73 206
this 0 73 206
summary 0 73 206
document 0 73 206
of 0 73 206
2009 0 73 206
can 0 73 206
give 0 73 206
us 0 73 206
an 0 73 206
idea 0 73 206
what 0 73 206
to 0 73 206
expect 0 73 206
from 0 73 206
Rome 0 73 206
in 0 73 206
2018, 0 73 206
now 0 73 206
that 0 73 206
the 0 73 206
“progressivist” 0 73 206
faction 0 73 206
in 0 73 206
the 0 73 206
Vatican 0 73 206
is 0 73 206
in 0 73 206
the 0 73 206
ascendancy 0 73 206
and 0 73 206
is 0 73 206
free 0 73 206
to 0 73 206
act 0 73 206
without 0 73 206
restriction. 0 73 206

What 0 73 207
comes 0 73 207
clear 0 73 207
comparing 0 73 207
this 0 73 207
document 0 73 207
to 0 73 207
Cor 0 73 207
orans 0 73 207
is 0 73 207
that 0 73 207
the 0 73 207
Vatican’s 0 73 207
machinery 0 73 207
has 0 73 207
long 0 73 207
been 0 73 207
at 0 73 207
work 0 73 207
forcing 0 73 207
a 0 73 207
uniform 0 73 207
and 0 73 207
essentially 0 73 207
bureaucratic, 0 73 207
heavily 0 73 207
authoritarian 0 73 207
and 0 73 207
legalistic 0 73 207
vision 0 73 207
of 0 73 207
contemplative 0 73 207
life 0 73 207
on 0 73 207
anyone 0 73 207
who 0 73 207
fails 0 73 207
sufficiently 0 73 207
to 0 73 207
resist 0 73 207
it. 0 73 207

And 0 73 208
with 0 73 208
the 0 73 208
statistics 0 73 208
offered 0 73 208
at 0 73 208
this 0 73 208
meeting 0 73 208
we 0 73 208
can 0 73 208
see 0 73 208
clearly 0 73 208
where 0 73 208
this 0 73 208
road 0 73 208
leads. 0 73 208

So 0 73 209
many 0 73 209
Catholics 0 73 209
in 0 73 209
the 0 73 209
last 0 73 209
40 0 73 209
years 0 73 209
assumed 0 73 209
that 0 73 209
under 0 73 209
the 0 73 209
“conservatives” 0 73 209
John 0 73 209
Paul 0 73 209
II 0 73 209
and 0 73 209
Benedict 0 73 209
XVI 0 73 209
at 0 73 209
least 0 73 209
the 0 73 209
Vatican 0 73 209
was 0 73 209
“onside.” 0 73 209
At 0 73 209
least 0 73 209
in 0 73 209
Rome 0 73 209
they 0 73 209
understood 0 73 209
the 0 73 209
terrible 1 73 209
threat 0 73 209
of 0 73 209
the 0 73 209
Bolshie 0 73 209
VaticanTwoist 0 73 209
revolutionaries. 0 73 209

But 0 73 210
this 0 73 210
report 0 73 210
of 0 73 210
2009 0 73 210
shows 0 73 210
a 0 73 210
clear 0 73 210
picture 0 73 210
of 0 73 210
a 0 73 210
Roman 0 73 210
congregation 0 73 210
determined 0 73 210
to 0 73 210
see 0 73 210
the 0 73 210
revolution 0 73 210
through 0 73 210
to 0 73 210
its 0 73 210
inevitable 0 73 210
conclusion. 0 73 210
