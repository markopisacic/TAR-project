joint 0
investigation 0
with 0
the 0
District 0
Attorney’s 0
Office. 0

This 0

is 0
ongoing 0
and 0
we 0
will 0
release 0
additional 0
details 0
as 0
they 0
become 0
available 0
and 0
it 0
is 0
appropriate 0
to 0
do 0
so. 0

If 0
an 0
average 0
citizen 0

into 0
the 0

home 0
and 0
shot 0
and 0
killed 0
an 0

they 0
would 0
be 0
in 0
jail—right 0
now. 0

However, 0
instead 0
of 0
immediately 0
arresting 0
the 0
officer 0
for 0
trespassing 0
and 0
murder, 0
she 0
was 0
simply 0
placed 0
on 0
administrative 0
leave—a 0
glaring 1
function 0
of 0
blue 1
privilege 1
indeed. 0

“Super 1
scary 1
because 0
the 0
police 0
are 0
supposed 0
to 0
protect 0
you 0
and 0
then 0
they 0
come 0
home 0
and, 0
you 0
know, 0
you’re 0
just 0
hanging 0
out 0
in 0
your 0
own 0
house 0
and 0
then 0
they 0
come 0
home 0
thinking 0
they’re 0
home 0
or 0
whatever. 0

I 0
don’t 0
know 0
if 0
she 0
was 0
tired 0
but 0
that’s 0
pretty 0
scary,” 0

reports 0

wrong 0
home 0
during 0
raids 0
and 0
killing, 0
maiming, 1
or 0
traumatizing 1
entirely 1
innocent 1
people, 0
this 0
is 0
the 0
first 0
time 0
we’ve 0
reported 0
a 0
story 0
of 0
an 0
off-duty 0
cop 0
going 0
into 0
the 0

home, 0
on 0
their 0

killing 0
someone. 0

why 0
this 0
officer 0
would 0
walk 0
into 0
an 0
apartment 0
that 0
was 0
not 0
hers 0
are 0
unclear. 0

However, 0
what 0
is 0
entirely 0
clear 0
is 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
a 0
mother 0
and 0
father 0
are 0
now 0
and 0
will 0
be 0
grieving 0
for 0
the 0
rest 0
of 0
their 0
lives 0
because 0
of 0
her 0
actions. 0

And, 0
in 0
a 0
slap 0
to 0
the 0
face 0
of 0
Jean’s 0
parents, 0
the 0
person 0
who 0
admitted 0
to 0
killing 0
their 0
innocent 1
son 0
has 0
yet 0
to 0
be 0
arrested. 0
