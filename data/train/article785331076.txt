Preliminary 0 339 17
information 0 339 17
suggests 0 339 17
that 0 339 17
the 0 339 17
officer 0 339 17
arrived 0 339 17
home 0 339 17
in 0 339 17
full 0 339 17
uniform 0 339 17
after 0 339 17
working 0 339 17
a 0 339 17
full 0 339 17
shift. 0 339 17

The 0 339 18
officer 0 339 18
reported 0 339 18
to 0 339 18
the 0 339 18
responding 0 339 18
officers 0 339 18
that 0 339 18
she 0 339 18
entered 0 339 18
the 0 339 18
victim’s 0 339 18
apartment 0 339 18
believing 0 339 18
that 0 339 18
it 0 339 18
was 0 339 18
her 0 339 18
own. 0 339 18

At 0 339 19
some 0 339 19
point, 0 339 19
the 0 339 19
officer 0 339 19
fired 0 339 19
her 0 339 19
weapon 0 339 19
striking 0 339 19
the 0 339 19
victim. 0 339 19

Responding 0 339 20
officers 0 339 20
administered 0 339 20
aid 0 339 20
to 0 339 20
the 0 339 20
victim, 0 339 20
a 0 339 20
26-year-old 0 339 20
male, 0 339 20
at 0 339 20
the 0 339 20
scene. 0 339 20

The 0 339 21
victim 0 339 21
was 0 339 21
then 0 339 21
transported 0 339 21
to 0 339 21
the 0 339 21
hospital 0 339 21
and 0 339 21

The 0 339 23
officer 0 339 23
was 0 339 23
not 0 339 23
injured 0 339 23
and 0 339 23
will 0 339 23
be 0 339 23
placed 0 339 23

pending 0 339 23
the 0 339 23
outcome 0 339 23
of 0 339 23
the 0 339 23
investigation. 0 339 23

Dallas 0 339 24

Department 0 339 24

conducting 0 339 24
a 0 339 24
joint 0 339 24
investigation 0 339 24
with 0 339 24
the 0 339 24
District 0 339 24
Attorney’s 0 339 24
Office. 0 339 24

This 0 339 25
investigation 0 339 25
is 0 339 25
ongoing 0 339 25
and 0 339 25
we 0 339 25
will 0 339 25
release 0 339 25
additional 0 339 25
details 0 339 25
as 0 339 25
they 0 339 25
become 0 339 25
available 0 339 25
and 0 339 25
it 0 339 25
is 0 339 25
appropriate 0 339 25
to 0 339 25
do 0 339 25
so. 0 339 25

If 0 339 26
an 0 339 26
average 0 339 26
citizen 0 339 26
walked 0 339 26
into 0 339 26
the 0 339 26
wrong 0 339 26
home 0 339 26
and 0 339 26
shot 0 339 26
and 0 339 26
killed 0 339 26
an 0 339 26
innocent 1 339 26
homeowner, 0 339 26
rest 0 339 26
assured 0 339 26
that 0 339 26
they 0 339 26
would 0 339 26
be 0 339 26
in 0 339 26
jail—right 0 339 26
now. 0 339 26

However, 0 339 27
instead 0 339 27
of 0 339 27
immediately 0 339 27
arresting 0 339 27
the 0 339 27
officer 0 339 27
for 0 339 27
trespassing 0 339 27
and 0 339 27
murder, 0 339 27
she 0 339 27
was 0 339 27
simply 0 339 27
placed 0 339 27
on 0 339 27
administrative 0 339 27
leave—a 0 339 27
glaring 1 339 27
function 0 339 27
of 0 339 27
blue 1 339 27
privilege 1 339 27
indeed. 0 339 27

“Super 1 339 28
scary 1 339 28
because 0 339 28
the 0 339 28
police 0 339 28
are 0 339 28
supposed 0 339 28
to 0 339 28
protect 0 339 28
you 0 339 28

then 0 339 28
they 0 339 28
come 0 339 28

you 0 339 28

don’t 0 339 29

this 0 339 32

However, 0 339 34
what 0 339 34
is 0 339 34
entirely 0 339 34
