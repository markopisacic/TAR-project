Wednesday 0
to 0

publish 0

for 0
a 0

to 0
block 0
the 0
venture. 0

Eight 0
US 0
states 0
and 0
the 0
District 0
of 0
Columbia 0
have 0
argued 0
in 0
court 0
that 0
the 0

make 0
untraceable, 0

Cody 0
Wilson's 0
Texas-based 0
company 0
Defense 0
Distributed 0
had 0
briefly 0
made 0
the 0
blueprints 0
available 0
online, 0

Seattle-based 0
US 0
District 0
Judge 0
Robert 0
Lasnik 0
granted 0
an 0
injunction 0
Tuesday 0
to 0
take 0
the 0
material 0
down. 0

The 0
Donald 0
Trump 0
administration 0
last 0
month 0
gave 0
permission 0
for 0
Wilson 0
to 0
publish 0
the 0
blueprints, 0
but 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
said 0
Wednesday 0
the 0
president 0
was 0
unaware 0
of 0
the 0
decision 0
and 0
was 0
glad 0
it 0
was 0
being 0
reviewed. 0

Eight 0
US 0
states 0
and 0
the 0
District 0
of 0
Columbia 0
sued, 0
arguing 0
the 0
blueprints 0
could 0
allow 0
anyone 0
-- 0
from 0
a 0
teen 0
to 0
a 0
'lone 0
wolf' 0
gunman 0
-- 0
to 0
make 0
untraceable, 1
undetectable 1
plastic 1
weapons. 1

Wilson 0
complied 0
with 0
the 0
judge's 0
order, 0
but 0
put 0
out 0
a 0
call 0
for 0
financial 0
support 0
for 0
the 0
legal 0
battle 0
ahead, 0
including 0
a 0
scheduled 0
August 0
10 0
court 0
hearing. 0

He 0
told 0
CBS 0
News 0
ahead 0
of 0
the 0
injunction 0
that 0
he 0
believes 0
"access 0
to 0
firearms 0
is 0
a 0
fundamental 0
human 0
dignity. 0

It's 0
a 0
fundamental 0
human 0
right." 0

"What 0
I'm 0
doing 0
is 0
legally 0
protected," 0
he 0
said. 0

"I 0
will 0
go 0
to 0
the 0
appellate 0
level. 0

I 0
will 0
go 0
to 0
the 0
Supreme 0
Court. 0

I 0
will 0
waste 0
all 0
my 0
time." 0

President 0
'glad' 0
for 0
review 0
- 0

As 0
uproar 0
was 0
building 0
Tuesday 0
over 0
Wilson's 0
efforts, 0
the 0
president 0
tweeted 0
that 0
making 0
plastic 0
3D-printed 0
guns 0
publicly 0
available 0
"doesn't 0
seem 0
to 0
make 0
much 0
sense." 0

White 0
House 0
spokeswoman 0
Sarah 0
Sanders 0
elaborated 0
Wednesday, 0
saying 0
the 0
administration's 0
Justice 0
Department 0
had 0
acted 0
on 0
its 0
own 0
in 0
granting 0
Wilson 0
permission 0
to 0
publish 0
the 0
blueprints 0
on 0
his 0
Defcad 0
website 0
-- 0
settling 0
a 0
five-year 0
legal 0
battle. 0

"The 0
Department 0
of 0
Justice 0
made 0
a 0
deal 0
without 0
the 0
president's 0
approval," 0
Sanders 0
said. 0

"The 0
president's 0
glad 0
this 0
effort 0
was 0
delayed 0
to 0
give 0
more 0
time 0
to 0
review 0
the 0
issue." 0

Sanders 0
also 0
repeated 0
the 0
administration's 0
claim 0
from 0
a 0
day 0
earlier 0
that 0
existing 0
law 0
already 0
prohibits 0
plastic 0
firearms. 0

The 0
National 0
Rifle 0
Association, 0
the 0
nation's 0
most 0
politically 0
influential 0
gun 0
rights 0
group, 0
echoed 0
that 0
claim, 0
contending 0
that 0
the 0
1988 0
law 0
made 0
the 0
current 0
3D-printed 0
gun 0
issue 0
moot. 0

"Regardless 0
of 0
what 0
a 0
person 0
may 0
be 0
able 0
to 0
publish 0
on 0
the 0
Internet, 0
undetectable 0
plastic 0
guns 0
have 0
been 0
illegal 0
for 0
30 0
years," 0
the 0
NRA 0
said 0
in 0
a 0
statement. 0

But 0
Wilson 0
has 0
gotten 0
around 0
the 0
legal 0
prohibition 0
by 0
providing 0
instructions 0
with 0
the 0
digital 0
files 0
for 0
3D 0
printing 0
his 0
"Liberator" 0
plastic 0
gun 0
that 0
call 0
for 0
an 0
approximately 0
six-ounce 0
block 0
of 0
steel 0
to 0
be 0
affixed 0
to 0
the 0
weapon. 0

Should 0
those 0
who 0
print 0
the 0
gun 0
follow 0
those 0
instructions, 0
metal 0
detectors 0
would 0
pick 0
up 0
the 0
weapons, 0
thus 0
complying 0
with 0
the 0
law. 0

But 0
while 0
users 0
can 0
build 0
the 0
gun, 0
there 0
is 0
no 0
way 0
to 0
ensure 0
they 0
affix 0
metal 0
to 0
it. 0

'The 0
debate 0
is 0
over' 0
- 0

Late 0
Tuesday, 0
dozens 0
of 0
Democratic 0
senators 0
introduced 0
legislation 0
to 0
prohibit 0
the 0
publication 0
of 0
3D-printable 0
firearm 0
designs, 0
a 0
move 0
gun 0
control 0
groups 0
applauded. 0

But 0
some 0
damage 0
was 0
already 0
done. 0

Wilson's 0
blueprints 0
had 0
been 0
posted 0
on 0
Defcad 0
before 0
the 0
court 0
order 0
took 0
effect 0
and 0
had 0
already 0
been 0
downloaded 0
thousands 0
of 0
times. 0

"The 0
debate 0
is 0
over. 0

The 0
guns 0
are 0
downloadable. 0

The 0
files 0
are 0
in 0
the 0
public 0
domain 0
-- 0
you 0
cannot 0
take 0
them 0
back," 0
Wilson 0
told 0
CBS. 0

Gun 0
control 0
groups 0
nevertheless 0
were 0
relieved 0
by 0
the 0
judge's 0
decision, 0
with 0
the 0
Brady 0
Campaign 0
to 0
Prevent 0
Gun 0
Violence 0
calling 0
3D-printed 0
firearms 0
"nothing 1
short 1
of 1
a 1
menace 1
to 0
society." 0

"There 0
is 0
simply 0
no 0
way 0
of 0
telling 0
how 0
much 0
damage 0
has 0
already 0
been 0
done 0
by 0
Cody 0
Wilson's 0
dangerous 1
and 1
reckless 1
actions," 0
Brady 0
Campaign 0
co-president 0
Kris 0
Brown 0
said 0
in 0
a 0
statement. 0

"This 0
is 0
a 0
strong 0
step 0
and 0
a 0
clear 0
victory 0
for 0
the 0
entire 0
gun 0
safety 0
movement, 0
but 0
we 0
simply 0
can't 0
let 0
up." 0

Prior 0
to 0
last 0
month, 0
Wilson 0
had 0
actually 0
been 0
losing 0
his 0
drawn-out 0
legal 0
battle, 0
after 0
both 0
a 0
federal 0
district 0
court 0
and 0
an 0
appellate 0
court 0
ruled 0
against 0
him. 0

The 0
US 0
Supreme 0
Court 0
declined 0
to 0
take 0
up 0
his 0
case. 0

But 0
in 0
a 0
sign 0
of 0
his 0
determination 0
to 0
continue 0
the 0
legal 0
fight, 0
a 0
message 0
on 0
the 0
Defense 0
Distributed 0
website 0
made 0
a 0
public 0
appeal 0
for 0
financial 0
support 0
"to 0
uncensor 0
the 0
site." 0
