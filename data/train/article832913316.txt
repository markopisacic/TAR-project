The 0
liberal 0
activist 0
group 0
MoveOn.org 0
issued 0
a 0
statement 0
just 0
as 0
news 0
that 0
Mueller’s 0
report 0
had 0
been 0
submitted 0
was 0
breaking. 0

“Should 1
Barr 1
announce 1
his 1
intention 1
to 1
cover 1
up 1
Mueller’s 1
report, 1
we 1
would 1
take 1
to 1
the 1
streets 1
in 1
‘Trump 1
Is 1
Not 1
Above 1
the 1
Law’ 1
rapid-response 1
protests 1
around 0
the 0
country,” 0
the 0
group’s 0
statement 0
read. 0

“We 0
will 0
not 0
allow 0
Trump 1
or 1
his 1
hand-picked 1
attorney 1
general 1
to 1
get 1
away 1
with 1
obstructing 1
this 1
criminal 1
investigation, 1
and 0
we 0
will 0
not 0
allow 0
Congress 0
to 0
abdicate 0
its 0
responsibility 0
under 0
the 0
Constitution.” 0

During 0
his 0
January 0
confirmation 0
hearings 0
before 0
the 0
Senate 0
Judiciary 0
Committee, 0
Barr 0
testified 0
that 0
he 0
would 0
“provide 0
as 0
much 0
transparency” 0
as 0
he 0
could 0
regarding 0
Mueller’s 0
report. 0

“I 0
also 0
believe 0
it 0
is 0
very 0
important 0
that 0
the 0
public 0
and 0
Congress 0
be 0
informed 0
of 0
the 0
results 0
of 0
the 0
special 0
counsel’s 0
work. 0

For 0
that 0
reason 0
my 0
goal 0
will 0
be 0
to 0
provide 0
as 0
much 0
transparency 0
as 0
I 0
can 0
consistent 0
with 0
the 0
law,” 0
Barr 0
told 0
the 0
committee. 0

“I 0
can 0
assure 0
you 0
that, 0
where 0
judgments 0
are 0
to 0
be 0
made 0
by 0
me, 0
I 0
will 0
make 0
those 0
judgments 0
based 0
solely 0
on 0
the 0
law 0
and 0
will 0
let 0
no 0
personal, 0
political 0
or 0
other 0
improper 0
interests 0
influence 0
my 0
decision.” 0
