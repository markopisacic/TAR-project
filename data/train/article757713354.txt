reneged 0

Trump 0
demanded 0
that 0

In 0

policy 0
leading 0
to 0

Hardly 0
an 0
encouragement 0
for 0
North 0
Korea. 0

North 0
Korea 0
was 0
right 0
on 0
target 0
when 0
it 0
accused 0
arch-neocon 0
John 0
Bolton 0
of 0
trying 0
to 0
sabotage 0
the 0
peace 0
deal. 0

In 0
2005-2006, 0
Bolton 0
served 0
as 0
the 0
Bush 0
administration’s 0
ambassador 0
to 0
the 0
UN. 0

He 0
established 0
a 0
tradition 0
for 0
the 0
post 0
of 0
being 0
anti-Muslim, 0
pro-Israel 0
and 0
anti-Russian, 0
a 0
policy 0
continued 0
to 0
this 0
day 0
by 0
the 0
current 0
US 0
UN 0
rep, 0
loud-mouthed 0
neocon 0
Nikki 0
Haley. 0

In 0
the 0
2005-2006 0
period, 0
after 0
years 0
of 0
negotiations, 0
the 0
US 0
and 0
North 0
Korea 0
were 0
close 0
to 0
a 0
nuclear/peace 0
deal. 0

Enter 0
John 0
Bolton. 0

He 0
succeeded 0
in 0
sabotaging 0
the 0
US-North 0
Korea 0
deal. 0

Why? 0

Because 0
Bolton, 0
as 0
an 0
arch 0
neocon, 0
was 0
fanatically 1
pro-Israel 0
and 0
feared 0
that 0
North 0
Korea 0
might 0
provide 0
nuclear 0
technology 0
to 0
Israel’s 0
foes. 0

As 0
usual 0
with 0
the 0
neocons, 0
Israel’s 0
interests 0
came 0
before 0
those 0
of 0
the 0
United 0
States. 0

Trump’s 0
newly 0
named 0
Secretary 0
of 0
State, 0
Michael 0
Pompeo, 0
is 0
also 0
an 0
ardent 0
neocon. 0

Last 0
week, 0
Bolton 0
went 0
onto 0
US 0
TV 0
and 0
actually 0
suggested 0
North 0
Korea 0
might 0
follow 0
the 0
course 0
set 0
by 0
Libya, 0
of 0
all 0
places. 0

Libya’s 0
then 0
ruler, 0
Muammar 0
Kadaffi, 0
bought 0
some 0
nuclear 0
equipment 0
from 0
Pakistan 0
so 0
he 0
could 0
hand 0
it 0
over 0
to 0
the 0
US 0
as 0
a 0
gesture 0
of 0
cooperation 0
after 0
the 0
Bush 0
administration 0
invaded 0
Iraq. 0

The 0
handover 0
was 0
done 0
with 0
much 1
fanfare, 1
then 0
the 0
US, 0
France 0
and 0
Britain 0
attacked 0
Libya 0
and 0
overthrew 0
Kadaffi. 0

Is 1
this 1
what 1
Bolton 1
has 1
in 1
mind 1
for 1
North 1
Korea? 1

The 0
Northerners 0
certainly 0
seemed 0
to 0
think 0
so. 0

Some 0
wondered 0
if 0
Bolton 0
and 0
perhaps 0
Pompeo 0
were 0
trying 0
to 0
sabotage 0
the 0
North 0
Korea 0
deal. 0

Or 0
were 0
at 0

being 0
incredibly 1
obtuse 1
and 0
belligerent. 0

Was 1
Trump 1
involved 1
in 1
this 1
intrigue? 1

Hard 0
to 0
tell. 0

But 0
he 0
can’t 0
be 0
happy. 0

His 0
minions 1

bootlickers 1
are 0
promoting 0
Trump 0

the 0
Nobel 0

rather 0

was 0
the 0

rattling 0
its 0
sabers 0
and 0
trying 0
to 0
protect 0
its 0
huge 0

Asia? 0

The 0
Pentagon 0
takes 0
a 0
dim 0

of 0

The 0

coming 0

just 0
sounds 0
too 1
good 1

Veteran 0

observers, 0
this 0

find 0
it 0
hard 0
to 0
believe 0
Kim 0
Jong-un 0
will 0
give 0
up 0
his 0

particularly 0
after 0
seeing 0
Trump’s 0
deceit 0
in 0
dealing 0
with 0
Iran 0
and 0
Kadaffi’s 0
murder. 0

Speaking 0

why 0
does 0
North 0
Korea 0
not 0
demand 0
that 0
the 0
US 0
