thoroughness.” 0 18 10

He 0 18 11
said 0 18 11
he 0 18 11
told 0 18 11
the 0 18 11
president 0 18 11
“that 0 18 11
we 0 18 11

so 0 18 11
that 0 18 11
we 0 18 11
too 0 18 11

how 0 18 11
the 0 18 11

is 0 18 12
conducting 0 18 12
its 0 18 12
own 0 18 12

Pompeo 0 18 12
said 0 18 12
those 0 18 12
results 0 18 12
will 0 18 12
also 0 18 12
be 0 18 12
taken 0 18 12
into 0 18 12
consideration. 0 18 12

He 0 18 13
again 0 18 13
stressed 0 18 13
the 0 18 13
importance 0 18 13
of 0 18 13

Arabia 0 18 13
as 0 18 13

ally, 0 18 13
in 0 18 13
a 0 18 13

he 0 18 13
noted, 0 18 13
that 0 18 13
dates 0 18 13
back 0 18 13
more 0 18 13
than 0 18 13
80 0 18 13

The 0 18 14
administration’s 0 18 14
reluctance 0 18 14
to 0 18 14
condemn 0 18 14
the 0 18 14
Saudi 0 18 14
government 0 18 14
has 0 18 14
fueled 0 18 14
criticism 0 18 14
from 0 18 14
Democrats 0 18 14
and 0 18 14
Republicans 0 18 14
in 0 18 14
Congress, 0 18 14
from 0 18 14
diplomats 0 18 14
and 0 18 14
from 0 18 14
even 0 18 14
some 0 18 14
corporations 0 18 14
that 0 18 14
long 0 18 14
have 0 18 14
profited 0 18 14
from 0 18 14
close 0 18 14
relations 0 18 14
with 0 18 14
the 0 18 14
Saudi 0 18 14
royal 0 18 14
family. 0 18 14

“We 0 18 15
just 0 18 15
are 0 18 15
going 0 18 15
to 0 18 15
allow 0 18 15
the 0 18 15

Pompeo 0 18 15
said. 0 18 15

“And 0 18 16
as 0 18 16
they 0 18 16
unfold, 0 18 16
as 0 18 16
we 0 18 16
make 0 18 16
a 0 18 16

for 0 18 16
ourselves 0 18 16
about 0 18 16
what 0 18 16
happened 0 18 16
there, 0 18 16
based 0 18 16
on 0 18 16
the 0 18 16
facts 0 18 16
that 0 18 16
are 0 18 16

to 0 18 16
us, 0 18 16
the 1 18 16
United 1 18 16

will 0 18 16
determine 0 18 16
what 0 18 16
the 0 18 16
