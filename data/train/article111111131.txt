Trump's 0
North 0
Korean 0
gamble 0
ends 0
with 0
'special 0
bond' 0
with 0
Kim 0

Nearly 0
five 0
hours 0
of 0
unprecedented 1
and 0
surreal 1
talks 0
between 0
US 0
President 0
Donald 0
Trump 0
and 0
North 0
Korea's 0
Kim 0
Jong 0
Un 0
culminated 1
on 0
Tuesday 0
with 0
fulsome 1
declarations 0
of 0
a 0
new 0
friendship 0
but 0
just 0
vague 0
pledges 0
of 0
nuclear 0
disarmament. 0

For 0

Trump, 0
that 0
amounted 0
to 0
a 0
triumphant 1
outcome 0
in 0
his 0
extraordinary 1
gamble 0
with 0
the 0
rogue 1
kingdom's 1
despotic 1
leader. 1

But 0
there 0
were 0
scant 0
details 0
on 0
what 0
new 0
commitments 0
had 0
been 0
secured 0
from 0
Kim, 0
even 0
as 0
Trump 0
announced 0
he 0
would 0
end 0
the 0
regular 0
military 0
exercises 0
the 0
US 0
conducts 0
with 0
South 0
Korea. 0

Whether 0
nuclear 0
disarmament 0
is 0
indeed 0
the 0
final 0
outcome 0
of 0
Tuesday's 0
summit 0
won't 0
be 0
known 0
for 0
years, 0
if 0
not 0
decades. 0

But 0
the 0
dramatic 1
act 0
of 0
extending 0
his 0
hand 0
to 0
one 0
of 0
America's 0
longtime 0
adversaries 0
will 0
forever 1
illustrate 0
Trump's 1
gut-driven, 1
norm-shattering 1
tenure. 1

"We 0
both 0
want 0
to 0
do 0
something. 0

We 0
both 0
are 0
going 0
to 0
do 0
something. 0

And 0
we 0
have 0
developed 0
a 0
very 0
special 0
bond," 0
Trump 0
said 0
at 0
the 0
conclusion 0
of 0
the 0
landmark 0
summit. 0

"People 1
are 1
going 1
to 1
be 1
very 1
impressed. 1

People 0
are 0
going 0
to 0
be 0
very 0
happy." 0

The 0
document 0
he 0
and 0
Kim 0
signed 0
said 0
the 0
North 0
Korean 0
leader 0
"reaffirmed 0
his 0
firm 0
and 0
unwavering 1
commitment 0
to 0
complete 0
denuclearization 0
of 0
the 0
Korean 0
Peninsula." 0

In 0
exchange, 0
Trump 0
agreed 0
to 0
"provide 0
security 0
guarantees" 0
to 0
North 0
Korea. 0

But 0
there 0
was 0
no 0
mentioning 0
the 0
previous 0
US 0
aim 0
of 0
"complete, 0
verifiable 0
and 0
irreversible 0
denuclearization." 0

And 0
Kim's 0
commitments 0
did 0
not 0
appear 0
to 0
go 0
beyond 0
what 0
he 0
already 0
pledged 0
to 0
do 0
in 0
April 0
when 0
he 0
met 0
South 0
Korean 0
President 0
Moon 0
Jae-in 0
along 0
their 0
countries' 0
border. 0

Trump 0
insisted 0
during 0
a 0
news 0
conference 0
the 0
agreement 0
went 0
further 0
than 0
many 0
people 0
expected. 0

But 0
he 0
acknowledged 0
the 0
effort 0
to 0
rid 0
North 0
Korea 0
of 0
its 0
nuclear 0
arsenal 0
was 0
in 0
its 0
early 0
stages. 0

"We 0
will 0
do 0
it 0
as 0
fast 0
as 0
it 0
can 0
mechanically 0
and 0
physically 0
be 0
done," 0
he 0
said. 0

More 0
critical, 0
in 0
Trump's 0
telling, 0
was 0
the 0
development 0
of 0
a 0
personal 0
bond 0
with 0
Kim, 0
a 0
brutal 1
dictator 1
responsible 0
for 0
the 0
deaths 0
not 0
only 0
of 0
his 0
own 0
citizens 0
but 0
of 0
at 0
least 0
one 0
American, 0
Otto 0
Warmbier, 0
who 0
was 0
returned 0
to 0
the 0
US 0
in 0
a 0
coma 0
only 0
to 0
die 0
days 0
later. 0

"I 0
think 0
our 0
whole 0
relationship 0
with 0
North 0
Korea 0
and 0
the 0
Korean 0
Peninsula 0
is 0
going 0
to 0
be 0
a 0
very 0
much 0
different 0
situation 0
than 0
it 0
has 0
in 0
the 0
past," 0
Trump 0
said 0
during 0
the 0
summit. 0

Later, 0
during 0
his 0
news 0
conference, 0
Trump 0
said 0
Warmbier's 0
death 0
contributed 0
to 0
the 0
summit 0
taking 0
place. 0

"Without 0
Otto, 0
this 0
would 0
not 0
have 0
happened," 0
Trump 0
said. 0

Trump 0
and 0
Kim 0
-- 0
both 0
intent 0
on 0
making 0
history 0
-- 0
greeted 0
each 0
other 0
early 0
in 0
the 0
day 0
with 0
extended 0
hands 0
in 0
front 0
of 0
a 0
row 0
of 0
US 0
and 0
North 0
Korean 0
flags, 0
a 0
previously 0
unthinkable 1
sight 0
that 0
reflects 0
a 0
new 0
chapter 0
in 0
the 0
two 0
countries' 0
acrimonious 1
relationship. 0

Trump's 0
threats 0
to 0
politely 0
walk 0
out 0
of 0
the 0
meeting 0
if 0
his 0
expectations 0
were 0
unmet 0
did 0
not 0
materialize. 0

Instead 0
he 0
predicted 0
he 0
could 0
"solve 0
a 0
big 1
problem, 1
a 0
big 1
dilemma" 1
alongside 0
his 0
new 0
partner. 0

"Working 1
together, 1
we'll 1
get 1
it 1
taken 1
care 1
of," 1
Trump 0
said. 0

The 0
remarks 0
came 0
amid 0
an 0
improbable 0
series 0
of 0
events 0
that 0
few 0
could 0
have 0
anticipated 0
even 0
three 0
months 0
ago. 0

The 0
unlikely 0
images 0
of 0
US 0
and 0
North 0
Korean 0
counterparts 0
engaging 0
in 0
friendly 0
dialogue 0
lent 0
the 0
day 0
an 0
air 0
of 0
unreality. 0

In 0
a 0
detailed 0
menu, 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
said 0
the 0
men 0
were 0
served 0
HÃ¤agen-Dazs 0
vanilla 0
ice 0
cream 0
for 0
dessert. 0

Other 0
unforeseen 0
events 0
also 0
surrounded 0
the 0
summit, 0
increasing 1
the 1
drama. 1

Minutes 0
before 0
the 0
historic 1
handshake, 0
Trump 0
tweeted 0
that 0
his 0
top 0
economic 0
adviser 0
Larry 0
Kudlow 0
had 0
suffered 0
a 0
heart 0
attack. 0

Immediately 0
after 0
the 0
encounter, 0
Dennis 0
Rodman 0
-- 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
only 0
Americans 0
to 0
have 0
met 0
Kim 0
-- 0
was 0
openly 0
weeping 0
while 0
being 0
interviewed 0
by 0
CNN's 0
Chris 0
Cuomo. 0

Even 0
Kim 0
seemed 0
to 0
acknowledge 0
the 0
surreality 1
of 0
the 0
day. 0

"Many 0
people 0
in 0
the 0
world 0
will 0
think 0
of 0
this 0
as 0
a 0
(inaudible) 0
form 0
of 0
fantasy 0
... 0
from 0
a 0
science 0
fiction 0
movie," 0
his 0
translator 0
was 0
overheard 0
saying 0
as 0
the 0
two 0
leaders 0
walked 0
down 0
a 0
white-columned 0
colonnade. 0

At 0
the 0
conclusion 0
of 0
the 0
summit, 0
Trump 0
hailed 1
the 0
talks 0
as 0
a 0
historic, 1
and 0
personal, 0
achievement. 0

"We 0
learned 0
a 0
lot 0
about 0
each 0
other 0
and 0
our 0
countries," 0
Trump 0
said. 0

"I 0
learned 0
he's 0
a 0
very 1
talented 1
man." 1

When 0
pressed 0
about 0
those 0
comments 0
in 0
light 0
of 0
Kim's 0
brutal 1
tactics, 0
Trump 0
continued 0
praising 1
the 0
North 0
Korean 0
leaders' 0
ability 0
to 0
run 0
a 0
country 0
at 0
a 0
young 0
age. 0

"He 0
is 0
very 1
talented," 1
Trump 0
said, 0
citing 0
Kim's 0
ability 0
to 0
"take 0
over 0
a 0
situation 0
like 0
he 0
did 0
at 0
26 0
years 0
of 0
age 0
and 0
run 0
it, 0
and 0
run 0
it 0
tough." 0

Kim 0
assumed 0
power 0
after 0
his 0
father 0
Kim 0
Jong 0
Il, 0
also 0
a 0
brutal 1
dictator, 1
died 0
in 0
2011. 0

Throughout 0
the 0
day, 0
Trump 0
and 0
Kim's 0
body 0
language 0
was 0
openly 0
friendly, 0
a 0
striking 1
warmth 0
given 0
Kim's 0
iron 0
grip 0
on 0
power 0
and 0
dismal 0
record 0
on 0
human 0
rights. 0

Trump's 0
move 0
to 0
meet 0
him 0
attracted 0
fierce 1
criticism 1
for 0
normalizing 0
a 0
regime 0
routinely 0
called 0
out 0
for 0
its 0
human 0
rights 0
abuses, 0
that 0
over 0
years 0
has 0
built 0
an 0
image 0
of 0
fearsome 1
renegade 1
regime, 0
throwing 0
around 0
threats 0
of 0
nuclear 0
war. 0

The 0
day 0
began 0
with 0
Trump 0
patting 0
Kim 0
on 0
the 0
back 0
and 0
placing 0
his 0
hand 0
on 0
the 0
North 0
Korean's 0
shoulder 0
as 0
they 0
walked 0
into 0
their 0
first 0
meeting. 0

Later 0
they 0
were 0
seen 0
smiling 0
and 0
laughing 0
over 0
lunch. 0

Trump 0
told 0
reporters 0
he 0
would 0
"absolutely" 1
extend 0
an 0
invitation 0
to 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
to 0
Kim, 0
who 0
also 0
heralded 1
a 1
new 1
era. 1

"Today, 0
we 0
had 0
a 0
historic 1
meeting 0
and 0
decided 0
to 0
leave 0
the 0
past 0
behind," 0
Kim 0
said 0
through 0
a 0
translator. 0

"The 1
world 1
will 0
see 0
a 0
major 0
change." 0

The 0
meeting 0
came 0
only 0
months 0
after 0
the 0
two 0
men 0
traded 0
nuclear 0
taunts, 0
ratcheting 0
up 0
tensions 0
and 0
leading 0
to 0
fears 0
of 0
war. 0

By 0
contrast, 0
Trump 0
appeared 0
to 0
back 0
off 0
a 0
military 0
footing 0
on 0
Tuesday, 0
declaring 0
the 0
US 0
will 0
stop 0
the 0
"war 0
games," 0
an 0
apparent 0
reference 0
to 0
joint 0
military 0
exercises 0
with 0
South 0
Korea 0
that 0
North 0
Korea 0
has 0
long 0
rebuked 0
as 0
provocative. 0

Trump 0
also 0
said 0
he 0
hopes 0
to 0
eventually 0
withdraw 0
US 0
forces 0
from 0
South 0
Korea, 0
but 0
said 0
"that's 0
not 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
equation 0
right 0
now." 0

"I 0
want 0
to 0
get 0
our 1
soldiers 1
out. 0

I 0
want 0
to 0
bring 0
our 1
soldiers 1
back 0
home," 0
Trump 0
said. 0

"But 0
that's 0
not 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
equation 0
right 0
now. 0

I 0
hope 0
it 0
will 0
be 0
eventually." 0

Tuesday's 0
meeting, 0
convened 0
at 0
a 0
luxury 0
hotel 0
on 0
the 0
island 0
of 0
Sentosa, 0
came 0
just 0
three 0
months 0
after 0
Trump 0
accepted 0
North 0
Korea's 0
invitation 0
for 0
talks 0
on 0
the 0
spot. 0

It 0
was 0
an 0
extraordinarily 0
compressed 0
timeline 0
for 0
the 0
landmark 0
summit, 0
which 0
at 0
one 0
point 0
was 0
called 0
off 0
entirely 0
as 0
communication 0
broke 0
down 0
between 0
Washington 0
and 0
Pyongyang. 0

The 0
talks 0
were 0
quickly 0
revived, 0
leading 0
to 0
the 0
highly 0
choreographed 0
event 0
that 0
unfolded 0
Tuesday. 0

After 0
the 0
men 0
shook 0
hands, 0
they 0
repaired 0
inside 0
for 0
one-on-one 0
talks. 0

In 0
that 0
first 0
meeting 0
they 0
were 0
joined 0
only 0
by 0
translators, 0
a 0
break 0
from 0
standard 0
practice 0
of 0
having 0
at 0
least 0
one 0
aide 0
present 0
for 0
high-stakes 0
huddles. 0

Later 0
in 0
the 0
day, 0
advisers 0
joined 0
the 0
talks 0
for 0
a 0
larger 0
bilateral 0
session 0
and 0
a 0
working 0
lunch. 0

Trump 0
took 0
keen 0
interest 0
in 0
the 0
pageantry 0
of 0
the 0
day, 0
insisting 0
the 0
pictures 0
beamed 0
around 0
the 0
world 0
reflect 0
a 0
commanding 1
leader 1
making 0
a 0
decisive, 0
world-altering 1
move. 0

At 0
the 0
same 0
time, 0
he'd 0
admitted 0
he 0
didn't 0
believe 0
he 0
required 0
extensive 0
preparation 0
to 0
take 0
stock 0
of 0
Kim. 0

As 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
advance 0
work, 0
Trump 0
commissioned 0
a 0
highly 0
produced 0
video 0
meant 0
to 0
convince 0
Kim 0
to 0
relinquish 0
his 0
weapons 0
and 0
open 0
his 0
country 0
to 0
outside 0
investment. 0

Trump 0
showed 0
Kim 0
the 0
movie 0
on 0
an 0
iPad 0
during 0
their 0
talks. 0

Here 0
in 0
futuristic 1
Singapore, 0
however, 0
Kim 0
was 0
able 0
to 0
view 0
the 0
benefits 0
of 0
economic 0
advancement 0
at 0
close 0
range. 0

He 0
was 0
spotted 0
taking 0
a 0
moonlit 0
stroll 0
around 0
the 0
high-end 0
Marina 0
Bay 0
Sands 0
hotel 0
and 0
casino, 0
owned 0
by 0
GOP 0
mega-donor 0
Sheldon 0
Adelson, 0
the 0
type 0
of 0
glitzy 0
development 0
few 0
North 0
Koreans 0
could 0
ever 0
imagine 0
coming 0
to 0
their 0
country. 0

Kim 0
was 0
cheered 0
by 0
onlookers 0
who 0
caught 0
sight 0
of 0
the 0
dictator, 1
who 0
until 0
earlier 0
this 0
spring 0
was 0
not 0
believed 0
to 0
have 0
ever 0
left 0
North 0
Korea 0
as 0
supreme 0
leader. 0
