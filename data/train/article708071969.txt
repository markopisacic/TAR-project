the 0

the 0
airborne 0
pneumonic 0
plague, 0
or 0
black 1

in 0
Madagascar 0
has 0
been 0
released. 0

Officials 0
warn 0
that 0
it’s 0
inevitable 0
that 0
this 0
bacterial 0
infection 0
that’s 0
infected 0
over 0
2000 0
people 1
will 1
become 1
resistant 1

The 0
only 0
way 0
to 0
treat 0
a 0
person 0
who 0
has 0
contracted 0
the 0
plague 0
is 0
with 0
antibiotics. 0

But 0
experts 0
now 0
warn 0
that 0
because 0
they 0
are 0
being 0
used 0
so 0
much 0
to 0
treat 0
the 0
infection, 0
antibiotics 1
resistance 1

making 0
this 0

Once 1
the 1

the 0
Madagascar 0
healthcare 0
system 0
will 0
be 0
overwhelmed, 0

As 0

noted, 0
should 0
the 0
disease 0
spread 0
to 0
the 0
African 0
mainland, 0
one 0
can 0
assume 0
that 0
it 0
will 0
be 0
all 0

impossible 0

thus 0
increasing 1
the 1
