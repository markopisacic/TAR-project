On 0

Shia 0

Despite 0
Israel's 0
repeated 0
warnings, 0
Barack 1
Obama's 1
reckless 1
appeasement 1
of 1
the 1
Iranian 1
regime 1
has 1
enabled 1
its 1
rise 1
as 1
a 1
hegemonic 1
threat 1
in 0
the 0
Middle 0
East 0
region 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
a 0
threat 0
to 0
international 0
peace 0
and 0
security. 0

In 0
2009, 0
Obama 0
turned 1
his 1
back 1
on 1
millions 1
of 1
dissidents 1
in 0
the 0
streets 0
of 0
Tehran 0
and 0
other 0
Iranian 0
cities, 0
who 0
were 0
peacefully 0
protesting 0
the 0
rigged 0
election 0
of 0
Mahmoud 0
Ahmadinejad 0
as 0
president. 0

In 0
2011, 0
Obama 0
precipitously 0
removed 0
the 0
remaining 0
U.S. 0
combat 0
troops 0
from 0
Iraq, 0
giving 1
rise 1
to 1
ISIS’s 1
re-emergence 1
in 1
Iraq 1
from 0
its 0
bases 0
in 0
Syria. 0

The 0
radical 0
Shiite 0
Iranian 0
regime 0
purported 0
to 0
come 0
to 0
the 0
“rescue” 0
of 0
both 0
countries 0
from 0
the 0
Sunni 0
terrorists, 0
turning 1
Iraq 1
into 1
a 1
virtual 1
vassal 1
state 1
of 1
the 1
largest 1
state 1
sponsor 1
of 1
terrorism 1
in 0
the 0
process. 0

Obama's 0
disastrous 1
nuclear 0
deal 0
with 0
Iran 0
legitimized 1
Iran's 1
path 1
to 1
eventually 1
becoming 1
a 1
nuclear-armed 1
state, 1
while 0
immediately 0
filling 0
its 0
coffers 0
with 0
billions 0
of 0
dollars 0
to 0
fund 0
its 0
aggression. 0

Meanwhile, 0
Syria 0
has 0
become 0
ground 0
zero 0
for 0
Iran's 0
execution 0
of 0
its 0
regional 0
ambitions, 0
which 0
is 0
to 0
establish 0
its 0
Shiite 0
Crescent 0
connecting 0
with 0
its 0
allies, 0
including 0
Iraq, 0
Syria 0
and 0
Lebanon. 0

This 0
plan 0
has 0
included 0
the 0
establishment 0
of 0
a 0
land 0
route 0
that 0
Iranian-backed 0
militias 0
secured 0
in 0
June, 0
beginning 0
on 0
Iran’s 0
border 0
with 0
Iraq 0
and 0
running 0
across 0
Iraq 0
and 0
Syria 0
all 0
the 0
way 0
to 0
Syria’s 0
Mediterranean 0
coast. 0

This 0
road 0
makes 0
Iran’s 0
job 0
easier 0
in 0
supplying 0
arms 0
by 0
land, 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
by 0
air 0
and 0
sea, 0
to 0
prop 0
up 0
Syrian 0
President 0
Bashar 0
al-Assad’s 0
regime 0
and 0
to 0
equip 0
Iran’s 0
own 0
forces 0
fighting 0
inside 0
of 0
Syria 0
in 0
support 0
of 0
Assad. 0

This 0
helps 0
explain 0
why 0
Iran 0
has 0
placed 0
so 0
much 0
importance 0
on 0
helping 0
the 0
Syrian 0
regime 0
establish 0
control 0
over 0
the 0
Deir 0
ez-Zor 0
area 0
in 0
eastern 0
Syria, 0
near 0
the 0
Iraqi 0
border. 0

“Everything 0
depends 0
now 0
on 0
the 0
Americans’ 0
willingness 0
to 0
stop 0
this,” 0
said 0
an 0
Iraqi 0
Kurdish 0
official 0
who 0
was 0
quoted 0
in 0
a 0
New 0
Yorker 0
article. 0

However, 0
U.S.-led 0
coalition 0
forces 0
apparently 0
have 0
done 0
next 0
to 0
nothing 0
to 0
stop 0
this 0
major 0
advance 0
in 0
Iran’s 0
Shiite 0
Crescent 0
expansion. 0

“Obama 0
ran 0
down 0
our 0
options 0
in 0
Syria 0
so 0
thoroughly, 0
by 0
the 0
time 0
this 0
administration 0
took 0
over,” 0
said 0
Andrew 0
Tabler, 0
senior 0
fellow 0
at 0
the 0
Washington 0
Institute 0
for 0
Near 0
East 0
Policy. 0

“The 0
Iranian 0
influence 0
is 0
spreading 0
because 0
they 0
are 0
so 0
heavily 0
involved 0
in 0
regime 0
activities,” 0
Tabler 0
added. 0

“It’s 1
a 1
new 1
monster.” 1

Furthermore, 0
Iran 0
has 0
funded 0
and 0
armed 0
its 0
terrorist 0
proxy 0
Hezbollah, 0
which 0
has 0
sent 0
its 0
militia 0
from 0
its 0
home 0
base 0
of 0
Lebanon 0
to 0
fight 0
alongside 0
Assad's 0
forces. 0

And 0
Iran 0
has 0
used 0
Syria 0
as 0
a 0
transit 0
point 0
for 0
shipment 0
of 0
sophisticated 0
rockets 0
to 0
Hezbollah 0
in 0
Lebanon 0
for 0
future 0
use 0
against 0
Israeli 0
population 0
centers. 0

Despite 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
Hezbollah 0
has 0
American 1
blood 1
on 0
its 0
hands, 0
the 0
U.S.-led 0
coalition 0
has 0
chosen 0
not 0
to 0
do 0
anything 0
about 0
Hezbollah’s 0
presence 0
in 0
Syria, 0
bought 0
and 0
paid 0
for 0
by 0
Iran. 0

While 0
Israel 0
chose 0
not 0
to 0
take 0
sides 0
in 0
Syria's 0
civil 0
war 0
with 0
military 0
intervention 0
of 0
its 0
own, 0
it 0
has 0
bombed 0
weapons 0
storage 0
facilities 0
and 0
convoys 0
inside 0
Syria 0
for 0
its 0
own 0
protection. 0

Just 0
recently, 0
on 0
September 0
7th, 0
Israeli 0
jets 0
struck 0
a 0
Syrian 0
weapons 0
facility 0
near 0
Masyaf, 0
which 0
was 0
reported 0
to 0
have 0
been 0
used 0
for 0
the 0
production 0
of 0
chemical 0
weapons 0
and 0
the 0
storage 0
of 0
missiles. 0

Israel 0
will 0
also 0
do 0
what 0
is 0
necessary 0
to 0
repel 0
Iranian-backed 0
forces 0
if 0
they 0
edge 0
too 0
close 0
to 0
areas 0
near 0
the 0
Golan 0
Heights, 0
shrinking 0
the 0
buffer 0
between 0
Israel 0
and 0
Iranian 0
controlled 0
territories. 0

However, 0
such 0
tactical 0
measures 0
may 0
not 0
be 0
enough 0
to 0
thwart 0
Iran’s 0
larger 0
ambitions. 0

In 0
light 0
of 0
intelligence 0
reports 0
that 0
Assad 0
may 0
be 0
ready 0
to 0
invite 0
Iran 0
to 0
set 0
up 0
military 0
bases 0
in 0
Syria, 0
Israeli 0
leaders 0
have 0
concluded 0
that 0
they 0
cannot 0
wait 0
until 0
the 0
Trump 0
administration 0
decides 0
to 0
deal 0
more 0
forcefully 0
with 0
Iran's 0
growing 0
use 0
of 0
Syria 0
as 0
a 0
staging 0
area 0
for 0
carrying 0
out 0
its 0
expansionist 0
Shiite 0
Crescent 0
strategy. 0

“Their 0
overriding 0
concern 0
in 0
Syria 0
is 0
the 0
free 0
reign 0
that 0
all 0
the 0
major 0
players 0
there 0
seem 0
willing 0
to 0
afford 0
Iran 0
and 0
its 0
various 0
proxies 0
in 0
the 0
country,” 0
wrote 0
Jonathan 0
Spyer 0
in 0
an 0
article 0
for 0
Foreign 0
Policy. 0

As 0
long 0
as 0
nobody 0
else 0
is 0
addressing 0
the 0
concern 0
Iran’s 0
growing 0
control 0
raises 0
in 0
a 0
satisfactory 0
manner, 0
“Israel 0
is 0
determined 0
to 0
continue 0
addressing 0
it 0
on 0
its 0
own.” 0

At 0
least, 0
Israel 0
has 0
a 0
more 0
sympathetic 0
ear 0
in 0
the 0
Trump 0
administration 0
than 0
it 0
did 0
in 0
the 0
Obama 0
administration 0
for 0
raising 0
its 0
concerns 0
about 0
Iran’s 0
growing 0
threat, 0
not 0
only 0
to 0
Israel 0
but 0
to 0
U.S. 0
interests 0
in 0
the 0
region 0
and 0
beyond. 0

President 0
Trump’s 0
sharp 0
denunciation 0
of 0
the 0
Iranian 0
regime 0
during 0
his 0
address 0
to 0
the 0
UN 0
General 0
Assembly 0
represented 0
a 0
welcome 0
departure 0
from 0
the 0
Obama 0
administration’s 0
milquetoast 1
approach 0
to 0
Iran. 0

As 0
the 0
U.S.-led 0
coalition 0
continues 0
to 0
drive 0
ISIS 0
from 0
its 0
bases 0
of 0
operation 0
in 0
Syria, 0
the 0
Trump 0
administration 0
has 0
proclaimed 0
its 0
intention 0
not 0
to 0
allow 0
Iran 0
to 0
turn 0
Syria 0
into 0
its 0
own 0
satellite, 0
as 0
Iran 0
has 0
essentially 0
done 0
in 0
Iraq. 0

National 0
Security 0
Adviser 0
H.R. 0

McMaster 0
said 0
that 0
the 0
“so 0
called 0
liberation 0
of 0
areas 0
by 0
Assad’s 0
forces 0
and 0
Iranian 0
proxies 0
could 1
actually 1
accelerate 1
the 1
cycle 1
of 1
violence 1
and 1
perpetuate 1
conflict 1
rather 1
than 1
get 1
us 1
to 1
a 1
sustainable 1
outcome.” 1
He 0
claimed 0
that 0
the 0
Trump 0
administration’s 0
“objectives 0
are 0
to 0
weaken 0
Iranian 0
influence 0
across 0
the 0
region 0
broadly,” 0
without 0
discussing 0
the 0
means 0
to 0
accomplish 0
those 0
objectives. 0

Whether 1
the 1
Trump 1
administration 1
follows 1
through 1
remains 1
to 1
be 1
seen. 1

In 0
the 0
meantime, 0
Israel 0
will 0
have 0
to 0
deal 0
with 0
the 0
fallout 0
of 0
Iran’s 0
ambitions 0
in 0
Syria 0
itself. 0
