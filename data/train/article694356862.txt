In 0 290 2
2009, 0 290 2

Obama's 0 290 5
disastrous 1 290 5
nuclear 0 290 5
deal 0 290 5
with 0 290 5
Iran 0 290 5
legitimized 1 290 5
Iran's 1 290 5
path 1 290 5
to 1 290 5
eventually 1 290 5
becoming 1 290 5
a 1 290 5
nuclear-armed 1 290 5
state, 1 290 5
while 0 290 5
immediately 0 290 5
filling 0 290 5
its 0 290 5
coffers 0 290 5
with 0 290 5
billions 0 290 5
of 0 290 5
dollars 0 290 5
to 0 290 5
fund 0 290 5
its 0 290 5
aggression. 0 290 5

Meanwhile, 0 290 6
Syria 0 290 6
has 0 290 6
become 0 290 6
ground 0 290 6
zero 0 290 6
for 0 290 6
Iran's 0 290 6
execution 0 290 6
of 0 290 6
its 0 290 6
regional 0 290 6
ambitions, 0 290 6
which 0 290 6
is 0 290 6
to 0 290 6
establish 0 290 6
its 0 290 6
Shiite 0 290 6
Crescent 0 290 6
connecting 0 290 6
with 0 290 6
its 0 290 6

including 0 290 6
Iraq, 0 290 6
Syria 0 290 6
and 0 290 6
Lebanon. 0 290 6

This 0 290 7
plan 0 290 7
has 0 290 7
included 0 290 7
the 0 290 7
establishment 0 290 7
of 0 290 7
a 0 290 7
land 0 290 7
route 0 290 7
that 0 290 7
Iranian-backed 0 290 7
militias 0 290 7
secured 0 290 7
in 0 290 7
June, 0 290 7
beginning 0 290 7
on 0 290 7
Iran’s 0 290 7
border 0 290 7
with 0 290 7
Iraq 0 290 7
and 0 290 7
running 0 290 7
across 0 290 7
Iraq 0 290 7
and 0 290 7
Syria 0 290 7
all 0 290 7
the 0 290 7
way 0 290 7
to 0 290 7
Syria’s 0 290 7
Mediterranean 0 290 7
coast. 0 290 7

This 0 290 8
road 0 290 8
makes 0 290 8
Iran’s 0 290 8
job 0 290 8
easier 0 290 8
in 0 290 8
supplying 0 290 8
arms 0 290 8
by 0 290 8
land, 0 290 8
as 0 290 8
well 0 290 8
as 0 290 8
by 0 290 8
air 0 290 8
and 0 290 8
sea, 0 290 8
to 0 290 8
prop 0 290 8
up 0 290 8
Syrian 0 290 8
President 0 290 8
Bashar 0 290 8
al-Assad’s 0 290 8
regime 0 290 8
and 0 290 8
to 0 290 8
equip 0 290 8
Iran’s 0 290 8
own 0 290 8
forces 0 290 8
fighting 0 290 8
inside 0 290 8
of 0 290 8
Syria 0 290 8
in 0 290 8
support 0 290 8
of 0 290 8
Assad. 0 290 8

This 0 290 9
helps 0 290 9
explain 0 290 9
why 0 290 9
Iran 0 290 9
has 0 290 9
placed 0 290 9
so 0 290 9
much 0 290 9
importance 0 290 9
on 0 290 9
helping 0 290 9
the 0 290 9
Syrian 0 290 9
regime 0 290 9
establish 0 290 9
control 0 290 9
over 0 290 9
the 0 290 9
Deir 0 290 9

area 0 290 9
in 0 290 9
eastern 0 290 9

near 0 290 9
the 0 290 9

“Everything 0 290 10
depends 0 290 10
now 0 290 10
on 0 290 10
the 0 290 10

to 0 290 10
stop 0 290 10
this,” 0 290 10
said 0 290 10
an 0 290 10
Iraqi 0 290 10
Kurdish 0 290 10
official 0 290 10

in 0 290 10

However, 0 290 11
U.S.-led 0 290 11
coalition 0 290 11
forces 0 290 11
apparently 0 290 11
have 0 290 11

in 0 290 11
Iran’s 0 290 11

expansion. 0 290 11

“Obama 0 290 12

down 0 290 12
our 0 290 12
options 0 290 12
in 0 290 12
Syria 0 290 12
so 0 290 12
thoroughly, 0 290 12
by 0 290 12
the 0 290 12
time 0 290 12
this 0 290 12

took 0 290 12
over,” 0 290 12

Andrew 0 290 12

fellow 0 290 12
at 0 290 12
the 0 290 12

Institute 0 290 12
for 0 290 12
Near 0 290 12

Policy. 0 290 12

“The 0 290 13
Iranian 0 290 13
influence 0 290 13
is 0 290 13
spreading 0 290 13
because 0 290 13
they 0 290 13
are 0 290 13
so 0 290 13
heavily 0 290 13
involved 0 290 13
in 0 290 13
regime 0 290 13
activities,” 0 290 13
Tabler 0 290 13
added. 0 290 13

“It’s 1 290 14
a 1 290 14
new 1 290 14
monster.” 1 290 14

Furthermore, 0 290 15
Iran 0 290 15
has 0 290 15
funded 0 290 15
and 0 290 15
armed 0 290 15
its 0 290 15
terrorist 0 290 15
proxy 0 290 15
Hezbollah, 0 290 15
which 0 290 15
has 0 290 15
sent 0 290 15
its 0 290 15
militia 0 290 15
from 0 290 15
its 0 290 15
home 0 290 15
base 0 290 15
of 0 290 15
Lebanon 0 290 15
to 0 290 15
fight 0 290 15
alongside 0 290 15
Assad's 0 290 15
forces. 0 290 15

And 0 290 16
Iran 0 290 16
has 0 290 16
used 0 290 16
Syria 0 290 16
as 0 290 16
a 0 290 16
transit 0 290 16
point 0 290 16
for 0 290 16
shipment 0 290 16
of 0 290 16
sophisticated 0 290 16
rockets 0 290 16
to 0 290 16

use 0 290 16
against 0 290 16
Israeli 0 290 16
population 0 290 16
centers. 0 290 16

Despite 0 290 17
the 0 290 17
fact 0 290 17
that 0 290 17
Hezbollah 0 290 17
has 0 290 17
American 1 290 17
blood 1 290 17
on 0 290 17
its 0 290 17
hands, 0 290 17
the 0 290 17
U.S.-led 0 290 17
coalition 0 290 17
has 0 290 17
chosen 0 290 17
not 0 290 17
to 0 290 17
do 0 290 17
anything 0 290 17
about 0 290 17
Hezbollah’s 0 290 17
presence 0 290 17
in 0 290 17
Syria, 0 290 17
bought 0 290 17
and 0 290 17
paid 0 290 17
for 0 290 17
by 0 290 17
Iran. 0 290 17

While 0 290 18
Israel 0 290 18
chose 0 290 18
not 0 290 18
to 0 290 18
take 0 290 18
sides 0 290 18
in 0 290 18
Syria's 0 290 18
civil 0 290 18
war 0 290 18
with 0 290 18
military 0 290 18
intervention 0 290 18
of 0 290 18
its 0 290 18
own, 0 290 18
it 0 290 18
has 0 290 18
bombed 0 290 18
weapons 0 290 18
storage 0 290 18
facilities 0 290 18
and 0 290 18
convoys 0 290 18
inside 0 290 18
Syria 0 290 18
for 0 290 18
its 0 290 18
own 0 290 18
protection. 0 290 18

Just 0 290 19
recently, 0 290 19
on 0 290 19
September 0 290 19
7th, 0 290 19
Israeli 0 290 19
jets 0 290 19
struck 0 290 19
a 0 290 19
Syrian 0 290 19
weapons 0 290 19
facility 0 290 19
near 0 290 19

and 0 290 19
the 0 290 19
storage 0 290 19
of 0 290 19
missiles. 0 290 19

Israel 0 290 20
will 0 290 20
also 0 290 20
do 0 290 20
what 0 290 20
is 0 290 20
necessary 0 290 20
to 0 290 20
repel 0 290 20
Iranian-backed 0 290 20
forces 0 290 20
if 0 290 20
they 0 290 20
edge 0 290 20
too 0 290 20
close 0 290 20
to 0 290 20
areas 0 290 20
near 0 290 20
the 0 290 20
Golan 0 290 20
Heights, 0 290 20
shrinking 0 290 20
the 0 290 20
buffer 0 290 20
between 0 290 20
Israel 0 290 20
and 0 290 20
Iranian 0 290 20
controlled 0 290 20
territories. 0 290 20

However, 0 290 21
such 0 290 21
tactical 0 290 21
measures 0 290 21
may 0 290 21
not 0 290 21
be 0 290 21
enough 0 290 21
to 0 290 21
thwart 0 290 21
Iran’s 0 290 21
larger 0 290 21
ambitions. 0 290 21

In 0 290 22
light 0 290 22
of 0 290 22
intelligence 0 290 22
reports 0 290 22
that 0 290 22

Syria, 0 290 22
Israeli 0 290 22
leaders 0 290 22
have 0 290 22
concluded 0 290 22
that 0 290 22
they 0 290 22
cannot 0 290 22
wait 0 290 22
until 0 290 22
the 0 290 22

more 0 290 22

denunciation 0 290 26
of 0 290 26

As 0 290 27
the 0 290 27

Syria, 0 290 27
the 0 290 27
Trump 0 290 27

that 0 290 29
the 0 290 29
“so 0 290 29
called 0 290 29
liberation 0 290 29

Assad’s 0 290 29
forces 0 290 29
and 0 290 29
Iranian 0 290 29
proxies 0 290 29
could 1 290 29
actually 1 290 29
accelerate 1 290 29
the 1 290 29
cycle 1 290 29
of 1 290 29
violence 1 290 29

perpetuate 1 290 29
conflict 1 290 29
rather 1 290 29
than 1 290 29
get 1 290 29
us 1 290 29
to 1 290 29
a 1 290 29
sustainable 1 290 29
outcome.” 1 290 29
He 0 290 29
claimed 0 290 29
that 0 290 29
the 0 290 29
Trump 0 290 29
administration’s 0 290 29
“objectives 0 290 29
are 0 290 29

across 0 290 29
the 0 290 29
region 0 290 29
broadly,” 0 290 29
without 0 290 29
discussing 0 290 29
the 0 290 29
means 0 290 29

those 0 290 29
objectives. 0 290 29

seen. 1 290 30

In 0 290 31
the 0 290 31

Israel 0 290 31
will 0 290 31

to 0 290 31
deal 0 290 31
with 0 290 31
