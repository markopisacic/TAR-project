substantiate 0
the 0

of 0

"The 0

was 0
released 0
today 0
without 0
our 0
knowledge 0
by 0
someone 0
outside 0

said 0
they 0

“For 0

the 0
purpose 0
of 0
objectivity 0
and 0
getting 0
all 0
of 0
the 0
facts 0
regarding 0
these 0

we 0

review 0
the 0

whether 0

The 0

of 0
the 0
Democratic 0
National 0

In 0

Ellison 0
thanked 0
Ellingstad 0
for 0
conducting 0
a 0
"thorough, 0
independent, 0
and 0
fair 0
review." 0

"I 0

believe 0

be 0
heard, 0

to 0
have 0
their 0
allegations 0

"This 0
is 0
why 0
I 0

Ellison’s 0

ex-girlfriend, 0
Karen 0
Monahan, 0
alleged 0
in 0
August 0
that 0
Ellison 0
dragged 0
her 0
off 0
a 0
bed 0
by 0
her 0
feet 0
while 0
screaming 0
obscenities 0
at 0
her 0
in 0
2016. 0

Monahan 0
said 0
she 0
had 0
video 0
footage 0
of 0
the 0
incident 0
and 0
levied 0
the 0
allegation 0
just 0
days 0
ahead 0
of 0
a 0
crowded 0
Democratic 0
primary 0
for 0
Minnesota 0
attorney 0
general 0
that 0
Ellison 0
went 0
on 0
to 0
win. 0

The 0

state's 0
Democratic 0
party 0
launched 0
an 0
investigation 0
into 0
the 0
claim, 0
retaining 0
a 0
local 0
attorney 0
with 0
links 0
to 0
the 0
state 0
party 0
to 0
determine 0
whether 0
the 0
alleged 0
incident 0
took 0
place. 0

Democratic 0
party 0
chairman 0
Ken 0
Martin 0
said 0
last 0
week 0
he 0
expected 0
the 0
investigation 0
to 0
conclude 0
soon. 0

A 0

draft 0
report 0
obtained 0
by 0
the 0
AP 0
noted 0
Monahan's 0
shifting 0
rationale 0
for 0
refusing 0
to 0
produce 0
the 0
video 0
footage, 0
including 0
that 0
it 0
was 0
lost, 0
was 0
on 0
a 0
USB 0
drive 0
in 0
storage 0
and 0
would 0
be 0
too 0
embarrassing 0
and 0
traumatic 0
to 0
release 0
it. 0

The 0

Ellison 0
accusations 0
have 0
put 0
Democrats 0
in 0
an 0
uncomfortable 0
position, 0
as 0
they 0
speak 0
out 0
on 0
sexual 0
misconduct 0
claims 0
against 0
Supreme 0
Court 0
nominee 0
Brett 0
Kavanaugh. 0

Kavanaugh 0
denies 0
the 0
accusations. 0

Monahan 0

slammed 0
the 0
Democratic 0
Party 0
for 0
its 0
response 0
to 0
her 0
allegations 0
when 0
compared 0
to 0
its 0
treatment 0
of 0
Christine 0
Blasey 0
Ford. 0

Ford 0
has 0
accused 0
Kavanaugh 0
of 0
attempting 0
to 0
force 0
himself 0
onto 0
her 0
during 0
a 0
high 0
school 0
party 0
nearly 0
four 0
decades 0
ago. 0

Many 0
prominent 0
Democrats 0
have 0
supported 0
Ford’s 0
allegations. 0

“No, 0

they 0
don't,” 0
Monahan 0
tweeted 0
in 0
response 0
to 0
a 0
question 0
of 0
whether 0
the 0
party 0
believes 0
women’s 0
stories. 0

“I've 0
been 0
smeared, 0
threatened, 0
isolated 0
from 0
my 0
own 0
party. 0

I 0
provided 0
medical 0
records 0
from 0
2017, 0
stating 0
on 0
two 0
different 0
Dr. 0

Visits, 0
I 0
told 0
them 0
about 0
the 0
abuse 0
and 0
who 0
did 0
it. 0

My 0
therapist 0
released 0
records 0
stating 0
I 0
have 0
been 0
dealing 0
and 0
healing 0
from 0
the 0
abuse.” 0

She 0

added: 0
“Four 0
people, 0
including 0
my 0
supervisor 0
at 0
the 0
time, 0
stated 0
that 0
I 0
came 0
to 0
them 0
after 0
and 0
shared 0
the 0
exact 0
story 0
I 0
shared 0
publicly, 0
I 0
shared 0
multiple 0
text 0
between 0
me 0
and 0
Keith, 0
where 0
I 0
discuss 0
the 0
abuse 0
with 0
him 0
and 0
much 0
more. 0

As 0
I 0
said 0
before, 0
I 0
knew 0
I 0
wouldn't 0
be 0
believed.” 0

Many 0
other 0
Democrats 0
and 0
progressives 0
– 0
who 0
largely 0
stayed 0
silent 0
after 0
the 0
accusations 0
against 0
Ellison 0
emerged 0
– 0
came 0
out 0
in 0
support 0
of 0
Ford, 0
including 0
Vermont 0
Sen. 0
Bernie 0
Sanders 0
and 0
Tom 0
Perez, 0
chairman 0
of 0
the 0
DNC, 0
who 0
urged 0
to 0
investigate 0
the 0
claims 0
and 0
Kavanaugh. 0

Monahan 0

went 0
to 0
reiterate 0
that 0
her 0
story 0
has 0
nothing 0
to 0
do 0
with 0
politics. 0

“I 0
have 0
nothing 0
to 0
prove 0
to 0
anyone, 0
I 0
simply 0
shared 0
my 0
story. 0

People 0
can 0
believe 0
it 0
or 0
not. 0

I 0
don’t 0
need 0
anyone 0
to 0
affirm 0
my 0
humanity, 0
I 0
affirmed 0
it,” 0
she 0
wrote 0
in 0
another 0
tweet. 0

“The 0

fact 0
that 0
both 0
parties 0
only 0
care 0
if 0
it 0
scores 0
political 0
points 0
is 0
hypocritical,” 1
she 0
added. 0

“Do 0
you 0
think 0
a 0
person 0
who 0
has 0
dealt 0
with 0
any 0
form 0
of 0
abuse 0
by 0
politicians 0
is 0
thinking 0
about 0

No, 0
we 0

are 0

trying 0
to 0
