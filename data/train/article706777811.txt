Some 0 89 7

the 0 89 7

(which 0 89 7

so 0 89 7
deadly 0 89 7
because 0 89 7
it 0 89 7

could 1 89 7
mutate 1 89 7

blight 0 89 7

Others 0 89 8
worry 0 89 8
the 1 89 8

The 0 89 9

kill 0 89 9

of 0 89 15

was 0 89 15
the 0 89 15
first 0 89 15
expert 0 89 15

He 0 89 16
previously 0 89 16
said: 0 89 16
“The 0 89 16
big 0 89 16

it 0 89 16
could 0 89 16
spread 0 89 16
to 0 89 16

Africa, 0 89 16
it’s 0 89 16
not 0 89 16
probable, 0 89 16
but 0 89 16
certainly 0 89 16
possible, 0 89 16
that 0 89 16

be 0 89 16

happen 1 89 17

it 1 89 17

get 1 89 17
out 1 89 17
of 1 89 17
our 1 89 17

huge 1 89 17
devastation 1 89 17
all 1 89 17
around 1 89 17

There 0 89 17
is 0 89 17
always 0 89 17
a 0 89 17
risk 0 89 17
with 0 89 17

that 0 89 17

globally, 1 89 17
Hunter 0 89 17
added. 0 89 17

“We 0 89 18
don’t 0 89 18
want 0 89 18
a 0 89 18
situation 0 89 18
where 0 89 18
the 0 89 18
disease 0 89 18

fast 0 89 18
it 0 89 18
gets 0 89 18
out 0 89 18

We 0 89 19
are 0 89 19
talking 0 89 19
about 0 89 19
it 0 89 19
spreading 0 89 19
in 0 89 19
days 0 89 19
rather 0 89 19
than 0 89 19
weeks.” 0 89 19
But 0 89 19
Hunter 0 89 19
is 0 89 19
adamant 0 89 19
that 0 89 19
a 0 89 19
well-developed 0 89 19
country 0 89 19
could 0 89 19
manage 0 89 19
the 0 89 19

should 0 89 19
a 0 89 19
global 0 89 19
outbreak 0 89 19
occur. 0 89 19

Hopefully, 0 89 20
most 0 89 20
will 0 89 20
never 0 89 20
have 0 89 20
to 0 89 20
find 0 89 20
out 0 89 20
how 0 89 20
well 0 89 20
another 0 89 20
country 0 89 20
can 0 89 20
manage 0 89 20
this 0 89 20
infection. 0 89 20

A 0 89 21
few 0 89 21
health 0 89 21

have 1 89 21
warned 1 89 21
the 1 89 21

Conway 0 89 23

it’s 1 89 23
“only 1 89 23

Conroy 0 89 24
warned 1 89 24
it 1 89 24
is 1 89 24
inevitable 1 89 24
that 1 89 24
the 1 89 24

across 0 89 24

“I 1 89 25

that 1 89 25

arrive 1 89 25
in 1 89 25
the 1 89 25
UK 1 89 25
once 1 89 25
more 1 89 25
– 1 89 25
it’s 1 89 25
just 1 89 25
a 1 89 25
question 1 89 25
of 1 89 25
‘when’, 1 89 25
not 1 89 25

And 0 89 26
it’s 0 89 26
not 0 89 26
an 0 89 26
exaggeration 0 89 26
to 0 89 26

“With 0 89 26
