fear 1
the 0

the 1

Daily 0

experts 0
warn 0
the 0
outbreak 0

in 0
Madagascar 0
this 0

being 0

than 0

which 0

This 0

of 0
the 0
pneumonic 0
plague 0
is 0
airborne, 0
easily 0
spread 0
by 0
a 0
cough 0

has 0

The 0

the 0

“Black 1

in 0
the 0

strikes 0
the 0

Paul 0
Hunter, 0
a 0
professor 0
of 0
health 0
protection 0
at 0
the 0
world-renowned 0
University 0
of 0
East 0
Anglia, 0
was 0
the 0
first 0
expert 0
to 0
predict 0
the 0
plague 0
could 0
travel 0
across 0
the 0
sea. 0

He 0
previously 0
said: 0
“The 0
big 0
anxiety 0
is 0
it 0
could 0
spread 0
to 0
mainland 0
Africa, 0
it’s 0
not 0
probable, 0
but 0
certainly 0
possible, 0
that 0
might 0
then 0
be 0
difficult 0
to 0
control. 0

If 1
we 1
don’t 1
carry 1
on 1
doing 1
stuff 1
here, 1
at 1
one 1
point 1
something 1
will 1
happen 1
and 1
it 1
will 1
get 1
out 1
of 1
our 1
control 1
and 1
cause 1
huge 1
devastation 1
all 1
around 1
the 1
world.” 1
There 0
is 0
always 0
a 0
risk 0
with 0
travel 0
that 0
the 0
disease 1
will 1
spread 1
globally, 1
Hunter 0
added. 0

“We 0
don’t 0
want 0
a 0
situation 0
where 0
the 0
disease 0
spreads 0
so 0
fast 0
it 0
gets 0
out 0
of 0
control. 0

We 0
are 0
talking 0
about 0
it 0
spreading 0
in 0
days 0
rather 0
than 0
weeks.” 0
But 0
Hunter 0
is 0
adamant 0
that 0
a 0
well-developed 0
country 0
could 0
manage 0
the 0
plague 0
should 0
a 0
global 0
outbreak 0
occur. 0

Hopefully, 0
most 0
will 0
never 0
have 0
to 0
find 0
out 0
how 0
well 0
another 0
country 0
can 0
manage 0
this 0
infection. 0

A 0
few 0
health 0
experts 0
have 0
warned 0
that 0
there 0
is 0
no 0
threat 0
to 0
the 0
UK, 0
however, 0
some 1
have 1
warned 1
the 1
plague 1
outbreak 1
will 1
certainly 1
spread 1
to 1
the 1
region. 1

Richard 0
Conroy, 0
the 0
founder 0
of 0
Sick 0
Holiday, 0
has 0
sent 0
a 0
chilling 1
warning 1
to 0
UK 0
authorities. 0

Conway 0
is 0
saying 1
it’s 1
“only 1
a 1
matter 1
of 1
time” 1
before 1
the 1
disease 1
arrives 1
on 1
British 1
soil. 1

Conroy 0
warned 1
it 1
is 1
inevitable 1
that 1
the 1
plague 1
will 1
spread 1
due 0
to 0
the 0
vast 0
movement 0
of 0
people 0
across 0
the 0
globe. 0

“I 1
believe 1
that 1
it’s 1
100 1
percent 1
likely 1
that 1
plague 1
will 1
arrive 1
in 1
the 1
UK 1
once 1
more 1
– 1
it’s 1
just 1
a 1
question 1
of 1
‘when’, 1
not 1
‘if’. 1

And 0
it’s 0
not 0
an 0
exaggeration 0
to 0
say 0
that 0
this 0
is 0
a 0
real 0
threat 0
– 0
a 1
ticking 1
time 1
bomb 1
that’s 1
waiting 1
to 1
decimate 1
the 1
world,” 1
Conroy 0
continued. 0

“With 0
the 0
current 0
outbreak 0
still 0
remaining 0
treatable 0
with 0
antibiotics, 0
however, 0
the 0
current 0
risk 0
is 0
low.” 0
