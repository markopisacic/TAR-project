Fast! 0 433 0

Notice 0 433 1
how 0 433 1
quickly 0 433 1
the 0 433 1
drive-by 0 433 1
media 0 433 1
and 0 433 1
self-proclaimed 0 433 1
"fact 0 433 1

gunned 1 433 1
down 1 433 1
the 0 433 1

with 0 433 1
their 0 433 1
lying 1 433 1
propaganda 0 433 1
over 0 433 1
the 0 433 1
video 0 433 1
that 0 433 1
was 0 433 1
enhanced, 0 433 1
not 0 433 1
doctored, 0 433 1
to 0 433 1
demonstrate 0 433 1
that 0 433 1
all 0 433 1
of 0 433 1
them 0 433 1
and 0 433 1
Jim 0 433 1

are 0 433 1
lying 1 433 1
through 0 433 1
their 0 433 1
Communist 1 433 1
teeth? 1 433 1

Yep, 0 433 2
I 0 433 2
noticed 0 433 2
too, 0 433 2
and 0 433 2
now 0 433 2
they're 0 433 2
trying 0 433 2
to 0 433 2
move 0 433 2
on, 0 433 2
but 0 433 2
I'm 0 433 2
gonna 0 433 2
get 0 433 2
in 0 433 2
one 0 433 2
last 0 433 2
bit 0 433 2
before 0 433 2
we 0 433 2

course, 0 433 3
Infowars' 0 433 3
Paul 0 433 3
Joseph 0 433 3
Watson 0 433 3
simply 0 433 3
enhanced 0 433 3
the 0 433 3
video 0 433 3
from 0 433 3
C-SPAN, 0 433 3
which 0 433 3
was 0 433 3
a 0 433 3

said 0 433 3
didn't 0 433 3
occur. 0 433 3

Watson 0 433 4
then 0 433 4
went 0 433 4
on 0 433 4
to 0 433 4

CNN's 0 433 23

that 0 433 23

you're 0 433 27

New 0 433 28

Times, 0 433 28
you're 0 433 28
lying. 1 433 28

Every 0 433 29
media 0 433 29
outlet 0 433 29
from 0 433 29
the 0 433 29
Associated 0 433 29
Press 0 433 29
to 0 433 29
NBC, 0 433 29
you're 0 433 29
lying 1 433 29
when 0 433 29
you 0 433 29
say 0 433 29
the 0 433 29
video 0 433 29
was 0 433 29
doctored 0 433 29
and 0 433 29
that 0 433 29
Acosta 0 433 29
didn't 0 433 29
touch 0 433 29
the 0 433 29
woman. 0 433 29

At 0 433 30
least 0 433 30
C-SPAN 0 433 30
is 0 433 30
neutral 0 433 30
in 0 433 30
the 0 433 30
matter 0 433 30
and 0 433 30
simply 0 433 30
let 0 433 30
the 0 433 30
video 0 433 30
reprove 0 433 30
every 0 433 30
single 0 433 30
one 0 433 30
of 0 433 30
them. 0 433 30

But 0 433 31
it's 0 433 31
more 0 433 31
than 0 433 31
that, 0 433 31
self-proclaimed 1 433 31
"fact 1 433 31
checkers" 1 433 31
like 0 433 31
Snopes 0 433 31
simply 0 433 31
posted 0 433 31
an 0 433 31
Associated 0 433 31
Press 0 433 31
article, 0 433 31
which 0 433 31
clearly 0 433 31
biased 0 433 31
towards 0 433 31
indicating 0 433 31
the 0 433 31
video 0 433 31
was 0 433 31
"doctored" 0 433 31
by 0 433 31
saying 0 433 31
it 0 433 31
was 0 433 31
sped 0 433 31
up, 0 433 31
but 0 433 31
that's 0 433 31
not 0 433 31
doctoring. 0 433 31

Doctoring 0 433 32
is 0 433 32
when 0 433 32
you 0 433 32
manipulate 0 433 32
the 0 433 32
content 0 433 32
to 0 433 32
misconstrue 0 433 32
the 0 433 32
reality 0 433 32
of 0 433 32
what 0 433 32
took 0 433 32
place. 0 433 32

If 1 433 33
you 1 433 33
want 1 433 33
to 1 433 33
see 1 433 33
doctoring, 1 433 33
go 1 433 33
to 1 433 33
0:58 1 433 33
of 1 433 33
the 1 433 33
video 1 433 33
above, 1 433 33
and 1 433 33
don't 1 433 33
be 1 433 33
drinking 1 433 33
anything 1 433 33
when 1 433 33
you 1 433 33
do 1 433 33
because 1 433 33
it's 1 433 33
hilarious. 1 433 33

But 0 433 34
it 0 433 34
isn't 0 433 34
just 0 433 34
Snopes 0 433 34
or 0 433 34
Politifact 0 433 34
and 0 433 34
outlets 0 433 34
like 0 433 34
that. 0 433 34

Take, 0 433 35
for 0 433 35
instance, 0 433 35
websites 0 433 35
like 0 433 35
MediaBiasFactCheck.com, 0 433 35
whom 0 433 35
I 0 433 35
had 0 433 35
to 0 433 35
have 0 433 35
my 0 433 35
attorneys 0 433 35
send 0 433 35
a 0 433 35
letter 0 433 35
for 0 433 35
their 0 433 35
libel 0 433 35
and 0 433 35
they 0 433 35
didn't 0 433 35
just 0 433 35
correct 0 433 35
it, 0 433 35
they 0 433 35
removed 0 433 35
it 0 433 35
entirely 0 433 35
because 0 433 35
they 0 433 35
knew 0 433 35
I 0 433 35
was 0 433 35
two 0 433 35

from 0 433 35
filing 0 433 35
a 0 433 35
lawsuit 0 433 35
against 0 433 35
them. 0 433 35

MBFC 0 433 36
actually 0 433 36
called 0 433 36
CNN 0 433 36
"left 1 433 36
biased," 1 433 36
which 0 433 36
is 0 433 36
correct 0 433 36
but 0 433 36
followed 0 433 36
up 0 433 36
with: 0 433 36

Overall, 0 433 37
we 0 433 37
rate 0 433 37
CNN 0 433 37
left 0 433 37
biased 0 433 37
based 0 433 37
on 0 433 37

selection 0 433 37
that 0 433 37
often 0 433 37
favors 0 433 37
the 0 433 37
left. 0 433 37

We 0 433 38
rate 0 433 38
them 0 433 38
Mixed 0 433 38
for 0 433 38
factual 0 433 38

However, 0 433 39
CNN’s 0 433 39

qualified 0 433 46
to 0 433 46
comment 0 433 46
on 0 433 46
the 0 433 46

It 0 433 47
isn't 0 433 47
just 0 433 47
MBFC 0 433 47
though. 0 433 47

Newcomer 0 433 48
NewsGuard 0 433 48
also 0 433 48
covers 0 433 48
for 0 433 48
CNN. 0 433 48

This 0 433 49
is 0 433 49
supposed 0 433 49
to 0 433 49
be 0 433 49
an 0 433 49
outlet, 0 433 49
at 0 433 49
least 0 433 49
what 0 433 49
I 0 433 49
was 0 433 49
told 0 433 49
in 0 433 49
email 0 433 49
and 0 433 49
phone 0 433 49
communication, 0 433 49
that 0 433 49
is 0 433 49
simply 0 433 49
to 0 433 49
determine 0 433 49
transparency 0 433 49
of 0 433 49
websites. 0 433 49

Instead, 0 433 50
they 0 433 50
not 0 433 50
only 0 433 50
do 0 433 50
that, 0 433 50
but 0 433 50
they 0 433 50
go 0 433 50
on 0 433 50
to 0 433 50
do 0 433 50
far 0 433 50
more 0 433 50
than 0 433 50
that. 0 433 50

In 0 433 51
rating 0 433 51
CNN, 0 433 51
NewsGuard 0 433 51
posts 0 433 51
this 0 433 51
nonsense. 1 433 51

I'm 0 433 52
sure 0 433 52
NewsGuard, 0 433 52
Yemile 0 433 52
Bucay, 0 433 52
Anna-Sophie 0 433 52
Harling 0 433 52
and 0 433 52
Amy 0 433 52
Westfeldt 0 433 52
need 0 433 52
to 0 433 52
update 0 433 52
this 0 433 52
in 0 433 52
the 0 433 52
light 0 433 52
of 0 433 52
the 0 433 52
obvious 0 433 52
lies 1 433 52
and 0 433 52
editing 0 433 52
of 0 433 52
the 0 433 52
Acosta 0 433 52
video 0 433 52
and 0 433 52
decades 0 433 52
of 0 433 52
documented, 0 433 52
outright 1 433 52
lies 1 433 52
and 0 433 52
propaganda 1 433 52
by 0 433 52
the 0 433 52
Clown 1 433 52
News 1 433 52
Network, 1 433 52
but 0 433 52
you 0 433 52
can't 0 433 52
expect 0 433 52
real 0 433 52
transparency 0 433 52
from 0 433 52
an 0 433 52
outlet 0 433 52
like 0 433 52
Newsguard 0 433 52
whose 0 433 52
writers 0 433 52
aren't 0 433 52
transparent 0 433 52
about 0 433 52
their 0 433 52
own 0 433 52
political 0 433 52
bias, 0 433 52
can 0 433 52
you? 0 433 52

Nope, 0 433 53
you 1 433 53
can't, 1 433 53
and 0 433 53
you 1 433 53
can't 1 433 53
expect 0 433 53
it 0 433 53
when 0 433 53
some 0 433 53
of 0 433 53
those 0 433 53
writers 0 433 53
write 0 433 53
for 0 433 53
other 0 433 53
publications 0 433 53
that 0 433 53
don't 0 433 53
measure 0 433 53
up 0 433 53
to 0 433 53
NewsGuard's 0 433 53
standards 0 433 53
either. 0 433 53

The 0 433 54
reason 0 433 54
this 0 433 54
little 0 433 54
incident 0 433 54
shouldn't 0 433 54
be 0 433 54
let 0 433 54
go 0 433 54
of 0 433 54
so 0 433 54
soon 0 433 54
is 0 433 54
that 0 433 54
it 0 433 54
is 0 433 54
one 0 433 54
of 0 433 54
the 0 433 54
clearest 0 433 54
demonstrations 0 433 54
of 0 433 54
the 0 433 54
media's 0 433 54
bias, 0 433 54
which 0 433 54
we 0 433 54
all 0 433 54
have, 0 433 54
lies 1 433 54
and 0 433 54
propaganda. 1 433 54

It 0 433 55
should 0 433 55
be 0 433 55
used 0 433 55
over 0 433 55
and 0 433 55
over 0 433 55
in 0 433 55
article 0 433 55
after 0 433 55
article 0 433 55
to 0 433 55
remind 0 433 55
people 0 433 55
about 0 433 55
the 0 433 55
total 1 433 55
dishonesty 1 433 55
and 0 433 55
complete 1 433 55
disregard 1 433 55
for 0 433 55
reporting 0 433 55
the 0 433 55
facts 0 433 55
by 0 433 55
outlets 0 433 55
such 0 433 55
as 0 433 55
CNN 0 433 55
and 0 433 55
to 0 433 55
not 0 433 55
blindly 0 433 55
trust 0 433 55
self-proclaimed 1 433 55
fact-checkers 1 433 55
who 0 433 55
will 0 433 55
not 0 433 55
tell 0 433 55
you 0 433 55
the 0 433 55
truth 0 433 55
either. 0 433 55

CNN 0 433 56
has 0 433 56
lost 1 433 56
its 1 433 56
mind 1 433 56
to 0 433 56
the 0 433 56
point 0 433 56
that 0 433 56
they 0 433 56
are 0 433 56
suing 0 433 56
over 0 433 56
Acosta 0 433 56
losing 0 433 56
his 0 433 56
press 0 433 56
pass. 0 433 56

He 1 433 57
was 1 433 57
their 1 433 57
inside 1 433 57
boy, 1 433 57
after 0 433 57
all. 0 433 57

But 0 433 58
the 0 433 58
real 0 433 58
irony 0 433 58
here 0 433 58
is 0 433 58
that 0 433 58
the 0 433 58
media 0 433 58
labeled 0 433 58
Paul 0 433 58
Joseph 0 433 58
Watson 0 433 58
and 0 433 58
Infowars 0 433 58
as 0 433 58
"conspiracy 1 433 58
theorists" 1 433 58
and 0 433 58
yet, 0 433 58
PJW 0 433 58
has 0 433 58
exposed 0 433 58
their 0 433 58
blatant 1 433 58
conspiracy 1 433 58
to 0 433 58
smear 0 433 58
President 0 433 58
Trump, 0 433 58
Sarah 0 433 58
Sanders 0 433 58
and 0 433 58
the 0 433 58
White 0 433 58
House 0 433 58
aide. 0 433 58

And 0 433 59
Jim 0 433 59
Acosta 0 433 59
believes 0 433 59
he 0 433 59
and 0 433 59
CNN 0 433 59
deal 0 433 59
with 0 433 59
facts 0 433 59
and 0 433 59
Infowars 0 433 59
doesn't. 0 433 59

Yeah, 0 433 60
right! 0 433 60

I'm 0 433 61
sorry 0 433 61
Jim, 0 433 61
I 0 433 61
can't 0 433 61
hear 0 433 61
you 0 433 61
over 0 433 61
the 0 433 61
booming 1 433 61
voice 0 433 61
of 0 433 61
your 0 433 61
hypocrisy! 1 433 61
