Major 0
General 0
Mohammad 0
Bagheri, 0
the 0
Iranian 0
Revolutionary 0
Guards 0
(IRGC) 0
military 0
commander 0
and 0
chief 0
of 0
staff 0
of 0
Iran’s 0
armed 0
forces, 0
warned 0
that 0
“putting 1
the 1
Revolutionary 1
Guard 1
in 1
the 1
terrorist 1
lists 1
with 1
terrorist 1
groups 1
can 1
be 1
very 1
costly 1
to 1
the 1
United 1
States 1
and 1
its 1
military 1
bases 1
and 1
forces 1
in 1
the 1
region.” 1
IRGC 0
commander 0
Mohammad 0
Ali 0
Jafari 0
said 0
on 0
October 0
8th 0
that 0
"if 0
the 0
news 0
is 0
correct 0
about 0
the 1
stupidity 1
of 1
the 1
American 1
government 1
in 0
considering 0
the 0
Revolutionary 0
Guards 0
a 0
terrorist 0
group, 0
then 0
the 0
Revolutionary 0
Guards 0
will 0
consider 0
the 0
American 0
army 0
to 0
be 0
like 0
Islamic 0
State 0
all 0
around 0
the 0
world." 0

The 0
next 0
day 0
the 0
Iranian 0
regime 0
warned 0
of 0
a 0
"crushing" 0
response 0
if 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
were 0
to 0
designate 0
the 0
IRGC 0
as 0
a 0
terrorist 0
organization. 0

President 0
Trump 0
has 0
called 0
the 0
Iranian 0
regime’s 0
bluff 0
with 0
his 0
announcement 0
last 0
week 0
that 0
he 0
would 0
do 0
just 0
that. 0

Designating 0
the 0
IRGC 0
as 0
a 0
terrorist 0
organization 0
and 0
imposing 0
new 0
sanctions 0
for 0
its 0
aggressive 0
actions 0
in 0
the 0
region 0
is 0
not 0
a 0
restoration 0
of 0
the 0
sanctions 0
lifted 0
by 0
the 0
Obama 0
administration 0
as 0
part 0
of 0
its 0
disastrous 0
nuclear 0
deal 0
with 0
Iran. 0

If 0
Iran 0
insists 0
it 0
can 0
do 0
what 0
it 0
wants 0
militarily 0
in 0
terms 0
of 0
missile 0
launches, 0
support 0
of 0
terrorist 0
groups 0
such 0
as 0
Hezbollah 0
and 0
Hamas, 0
and 0
arms 0
transfers 0
without 0
violating 0
the 0
nuclear 0
deal, 0
then 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
can 0
certainly 0
act 0
to 0
curb 0
such 0
activities 0
through 0
financial 0
pressure. 0

The 0
U.S. 0
can 0
impose 0
sanctions 0
against 0
the 0
Iranian 0
regime’s 0
principal 0
instrument 0
for 0
projecting 0
aggressive, 0
destabilizing 0
force 0
outside 0
of 0
its 0
borders 0
without 0
violating 0
the 0
nuclear 0
deal. 0

The 0
Iranian 0
regime 0
does 0
not 0
see 0
it 0
that 0
way, 0
however. 0

With 0
the 0
lifting 0
of 0
the 0
nuclear-related 0
sanctions 0
making 0
available 0
billions 0
of 0
dollars 0
to 0
Iran’s 0
leaders 0
to 0
further 0
finance 0
the 0
IRGC’s 0
exploits 0
in 0
Iraq, 0
Syria, 0
Lebanon, 0
Yemen 0
and 0
elsewhere, 0
the 0
regime 0
is 0
furious 0
that 0
the 0
Trump 0
administration 0
is 0
tightening 0
the 0
financial 0
screws 0
again, 0
even 0
if 0
for 0
reasons 0
not 0
directly 0
related 0
to 0
Iran’s 0
compliance 0
with 0
the 0
terms 0
of 0
the 0
nuclear 0
deal. 0

Thus, 1
it 1
is 1
threatening 1
U.S. 1
forces 1
and 1
bases 1
in 1
the 1
region. 1

A 0
couple 0
of 0
seemingly 0
unrelated 0
events 0
this 0
past 0
week 0
point 1
to 1
Iran’s 1
positioning 1
itself 1
for 1
more 1
aggressive 1
military 1
actions 1
that 1
could 1
place 1
U.S. 1
forces 1
in 1
harm’s 1
way. 1

On 0
Tuesday, 0
Major 0
General 0
Bagheri 0
landed 0
in 0
Damascus 0
for 0
talks 0
with 0
Syrian 0
President 0
Bashar 0
Assad 0
and 0
senior 0
Syrian 0
officials, 0
including 0
the 0
defense 0
minister 0
and 0
the 0
chief 0
of 0
staff 0
of 0
the 0
Syrian 0
armed 0
forces. 0

Bagheri 0
is 0
quoted 0
as 0
saying 0
that 0
his 0
visit’s 0
purpose 0
was 0
to 0
“put 0
a 0
joint 0
strategy 0
on 0
continuing 0
co-ordination 0
and 0
co-operation 0
at 0
the 0
military 0
level.” 0
Some 0
experts 0
on 0
Iran 0
believe 0
that 0
Bagheri’s 0
visit 0
to 0
Damascus 0
at 0
this 0
time 0
is 0
intended 0
to 0
reinforce 0
a 0
message 0
that 0
Iran 0
will 0
continue 0
to 0
supply 0
weaponry 0
to 0
Syria 0
and 0
to 0
reinforce 0
the 0
presence 0
of 0
its 0
terrorist 0
proxy 0
Hezbollah 0
in 0
Syria. 0

This 1
will 1
not 1
only 1
serve 1
to 1
bolster 1
the 1
Assad 1
regime, 1
but 1
it 1
also 1
will 1
strengthen 1
Iran's 1
ability 1
to 1
follow 1
through 1
on 1
its 1
threats 1
to 1
the 1
U.S. 1
and 1
its 1
allies, 1
principally 1
Israel. 1

Meanwhile, 0
following 0
the 0
departure 0
of 0
the 0
Kurds 0
from 0
Kirkuk, 0
Iraq 0
earlier 0
this 0
week, 0
the 0
IRGC’s 0
operational 0
Al 0
Qods 0
arm 0
reportedly 0
established 0
a 0
command 0
center 0
and 0
five 0
bases 0
there. 0

According 0
to 0
Debkafile, 0
this 0
constitutes 0
“the 0
first 0
military 0
facility 0
Iran 0
has 0
ever 0
established 0
openly 0
in 0
Iraq.” 0
The 0
Kirkuk 0
region 0
holds 0
45 0
percent 0
of 0
Iraqi’s 0
oil. 0

The 1
Iraqi 1
branch 1
of 1
Iran’s 1
terrorist 1
proxy 1
Hezbollah 1
has 1
vowed 1
that 1
once 1
ISIS 1
is 1
defeated 1
it 1
will 1
start 1
killing 1
Americans, 1
as 1
it 1
has 1
done 1
before. 1

It 0
is 0
against 0
this 0
backdrop 0
that 0
U.S. 0
ambassador 0
to 0
the 0
United 0
Nations 0
Nikki 0
Haley 0
used 0
her 0
entire 0
speech 0
to 0
the 0
UN 0
Security 0
Council 0
on 0
Wednesday 0
to 0
denounce 0
the 0
Iranian 0
regime 0
on 0
multiple 0
grounds. 0

The 0
session 0
was 0
supposed 0
to 0
be 0
devoted 0
to 0
the 0
Israeli-Palestinian 0
conflict, 0
but 0
Ambassador 0
Haley 0
departed 0
from 0
the 0
monthly 0
ritual 0
during 0
which 0
Israel 0
is 0
normally 0
singled 0
out 0
for 0
criticism 0
by 0
other 0
Council 0
members. 0

She 0
went 0
after 0
Iran 0
instead. 0

She 0
explained 0
why 0
the 0
Trump 0
administration 0
decided 0
to 0
take 0
“a 0
comprehensive 0
approach 0
to 0
confronting 0
the 0
Iranian 0
regime,” 0
which 0
does 0
not 0
give 0
the 0
regime 0
a 0
get 0
out 0
of 0
jail 0
free 0
card 0
even 0
if 0
it 0
is 0
in 0
technical 0
compliance 0
with 0
the 0
loophole-ridden 0
nuclear 0
deal 0
agreed 0
to 0
by 0
the 0
Obama 0
administration. 0

“We 0
can’t 0
talk 0
about 0
stability 0
in 0
the 0
Middle 0
East 0
without 0
talking 0
about 0
Iran,” 0
Ambassador 0
Haley 0
said. 0

“That’s 0
because 0
nearly 0
every 0
threat 0
to 0
peace 0
and 0
security 0
in 0
the 0
Middle 0
East 0
is 0
connected 0
to 0
Iran’s 0
outlaw 1
behavior. 1

The 0
United 0
States 0
has 0
now 0
embarked 0
on 0
a 0
course 0
that 0
attempts 0
to 0
address 0
all 0
aspects 0
of 0
Iran’s 0
destructive 0
conduct, 0
not 0
just 0
one 0
aspect. 0

It’s 0
critical 0
that 0
the 0
international 0
community 0
do 0
the 0
same. 0

Judging 0
Iran 0
by 0
the 0
narrow 0
confines 0
of 0
the 0
nuclear 0
deal 0
misses 0
the 0
true 0
nature 0
of 0
the 0
threat. 0

Iran 0
must 0
be 0
judged 0
in 0
totality 0
of 0
its 1
aggressive, 1
destabilizing, 1
and 1
unlawful 1
behavior. 1

To 1
do 1
otherwise 1
would 1
be 1
foolish.” 1

Ambassador 0
Haley 0
accused 0
the 0
Iranian 0
regime 0
of 0
continuing 0
to 0
“play” 0
the 0
Security 0
Council. 0

“Iran 0
hides 0
behind 0
its 0
assertion 0
of 0
technical 0
compliance 0
with 0
the 0
nuclear 0
deal 0
while 0
it 0
brazenly 0
violates 0
the 0
other 0
limits 0
on 0
its 0
behavior. 0

And 0
we 0
have 0
allowed 0
them 0
to 0
get 0
away 0
with 0
it. 0

This 0
must 0
stop.” 0

Ambassador 0
Haley 0
proceeded 0
to 0
list 0
various 0
violations 0
by 0
the 0
Iranian 0
regime 0
of 0
Security 0
Council 0
resolutions 0
pertaining 0
to 0
the 0
transfer 0
of 0
conventional 0
weapons 0
from 0
Iran 0
and 0
the 0
arming 0
of 0
terrorist 0
groups, 0
including 0
the 0
Houthi 0
rebels 0
in 0
Yemen 0
and 0
Hezbollah. 0

She 0
also 0
pointed 0
to 0
what 0
she 0
called 0
the 1
Iranian 1
regime’s 1
“most 1
threatening 1
act” 1
– 0
its 0
launch 0
of 0
ballistic 0
missiles 0
capable 0
of 0
carrying 0
nuclear 0
weapons. 0

“When 0
a 0
rogue 0
regime 0
starts 0
down 0
the 0
path 0
of 0
ballistic 0
missiles, 0
it 1
tells 1
us 1
that 1
we 1
will 1
soon 1
have 1
another 1
North 1
Korea 1
on 1
our 1
hands,” 1
Ambassador 0
Haley 0
said. 0

“If 1
it 1
is 1
wrong 1
for 1
North 1
Korea 1
to 1
do 1
this, 1
why 1
doesn’t 1
that 1
same 1
mentality 1
apply 1
to 1
Iran? 1

“ 1

As 0
for 0
the 0
Iran’s 0
supposed 0
technical 0
compliance 0
with 0
its 0
commitments 0
under 0
the 0
nuclear 0
deal 0
itself, 0
known 0
as 0
the 0
Joint 0
Comprehensive 0
Plan 0
of 0
Action 0
(JCPOA), 0
the 0
UN’s 0
international 0
inspectors 0
are 0
not 0
able 0
to 0
visit 0
Iran’s 0
military 0
sites. 0

Past 0
work 0
on 0
nuclear 0
explosive 0
trigger 0
devices 0
appears 0
to 0
have 0
taken 0
place 0
at 0
one 0
or 0
more 0
such 0
sites 0
in 0
the 0
past. 0

International 0
Atomic 0
Energy 0
Agency 0
(IAEA) 0
Director 0
General 0
Yukiya 0
Amano 0
admitted 0
last 0
month 0
that 0
when 0
it 0
comes 0
to 0
the 0
IAEA’s 0
capacity 0
to 0
check 0
whether 0
Iran 0
was 0
conducting 0
work 0
on 0
a 0
nuclear 0
explosive 0
device, 0
his 0
agency’s 0
“tools 0
are 0
limited.” 0
The 0
Iranian 0
regime 0
has 0
also 0
attempted 0
to 0
skirt 0
the 0
restrictions 0
in 0
the 0
JCPOA 0
on 0
its 0
procurement 0
of 0
materials, 0
equipment, 0
goods 0
and 0
technology 0
related 0
to 0
Iran’s 0
nuclear 0
activities. 0

The 0
Heritage 0
Foundation 0
noted 0
in 0
its 0
recent 0
report 0
on 0
the 0
JCPOA, 0
for 0
example, 0
that 0
Iran 0
was 0
“caught 1
red-handed 1
trying 0
to 0
purchase 0
nuclear 0
technology 0
and 0
restricted 0
ballistic 0
missile 0
technology 0
from 0
German 0
companies.” 0

U.S. 0
intelligence 0
had 0
discovered 0
North 0
Korea’s 0
transfer 0
of 0
missile 0
parts 0
to 0
Iran 0
at 0
the 0
very 0
same 0
time 0
that 0
Iran 0
was 0
negotiating 0
the 0
nuclear 0
deal, 0
in 0
clear 0
violation 0
of 0
UN 0
Security 0
Council 0
resolutions 0
then 0
in 0
effect. 0

The 0
Obama 0
administration 0
chose 0
to 0
look 0
the 0
other 0
way. 0

Does 0
anybody 0
with 0
a 1
modicum 1
of 1
sense 1
really 0
believe 0
that 0
such 0
collaboration 0
between 0
the 0
two 0
rogue 0
nations 0
is 0
not 0
going 0
on 0
today? 0

Iran 0
is 0
flush 0
with 0
cash, 0
thanks 0
to 0
the 0
JCPOA. 0

It 0
wants 0
to 0
build 0
out 0
its 0
missile 0
and 0
nuclear 0
enrichment 0
capabilities. 0

In 0
addition 0
to 0
covert 0
transfers 0
of 0
materials 0
and 0
technology 0
to 0
Iran 0
in 0
violation 0
of 0
the 0
nuclear 0
deal, 0
the 0
JCPOA 0
may 0
provide 0
a 0
loophole 0
for 0
Iran 0
to 0
exploit 0
in 0
outsourcing 0
some 0
of 0
the 0
development 0
work 0
to 0
North 0
Korea 0
for 0
hard 0
currency, 0
which 0
North 0
Korea 0
desperately 0
needs. 0

They 1
are 1
a 1
perfect 1
match 1
for 1
each 1
other. 1

Proponents 0
of 0
the 0
JCPOA 0
argue 0
that 0
exiting 0
the 0
nuclear 0
deal 0
unless 0
it 0
is 0
changed 0
to 0
the 0
Trump 0
administration’s 0
satisfaction 0
would 0
undermine 0
U.S. 0
credibility 0
with 0
North 0
Korea 0
and 0
thereby 0
kill 0
any 0
chance 0
of 0
negotiations 0
to 0
resolve 0
the 0
crisis 0
caused 0
by 0
North 0
Korea's 0
continued 0
testing 0
of 0
sophisticated 0
nuclear 0
arms 0
and 0
ballistic 0
missiles. 0

"If 1
we 1
want 1
to 1
talk 1
to 1
North 1
Korea 1
now, 1
the 1
possible 1
end 1
for 1
the 1
nuclear 1
deal 1
with 1
Iran 1
would 1
jeopardize 1
the 1
credibility 1
of 1
such 1
treaties," 1
Reuters 0
quoted 0
German 0
Foreign 0
Minister 0
Sigmar 0
Gabriel 0
as 0
saying. 0

Germany 0
is 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
parties 0
to 0
the 0
JCPOA. 0

Other 0
European 0
allies 0
have 0
voiced 0
similar 0
concerns. 0

So 0
have 0
Obama’s 0
former 0
Secretaries 0
of 0
State 0
Hillary 0
Clinton 0
and 0
John 0
Kerry. 0

This 0
argument 0
is 0
absurd 0
on 0
its 0
face. 0

The 0
whole 0
point 0
is 0
to 0
prevent 0
Iran 0
from 0
becoming 0
the 0
next 0
North 0
Korea, 0
not 0
to 1
kick 1
the 1
can 1
down 1
the 1
road 1
as 1
usual. 1

North 0
Korea’s 0
aggressive 0
pursuit 0
of 0
nuclear 0
weapons 0
and 0
of 0
intercontinental 0
ballistic 0
missiles 0
equipped 0
with 0
nuclear 0
warheads 0
proves 0
that 0
weak 0
agreements 0
full 0
of 0
front-loaded 0
goodies 0
rewarding 0
rogue 0
regimes 0
for 0
elusive 0
promises 0
are 0
worthless. 0
