that 0 37 1
“putting 1 37 1

to 1 37 1

IRGC 0 37 1
commander 0 37 1
Mohammad 0 37 1
Ali 0 37 1
Jafari 0 37 1
said 0 37 1
on 0 37 1
October 0 37 1
8th 0 37 1
that 0 37 1
"if 0 37 1
the 0 37 1
news 0 37 1
is 0 37 1
correct 0 37 1
about 0 37 1
the 1 37 1
stupidity 1 37 1
of 1 37 1
the 1 37 1

in 0 37 1
considering 0 37 1
the 0 37 1

a 0 37 1
terrorist 0 37 1
group, 0 37 1
then 0 37 1
the 0 37 1

will 0 37 1
consider 0 37 1
the 0 37 1

The 0 37 2
next 0 37 2
day 0 37 2
the 0 37 2
Iranian 0 37 2
regime 0 37 2
warned 0 37 2
of 0 37 2
a 0 37 2
"crushing" 0 37 2
response 0 37 2
if 0 37 2
the 0 37 2
United 0 37 2
States 0 37 2
were 0 37 2
to 0 37 2
designate 0 37 2
the 0 37 2
IRGC 0 37 2
as 0 37 2
a 0 37 2
terrorist 0 37 2
organization. 0 37 2

President 0 37 3
Trump 0 37 3
has 0 37 3
called 0 37 3
the 0 37 3
Iranian 0 37 3
regime’s 0 37 3
bluff 0 37 3
with 0 37 3
his 0 37 3
announcement 0 37 3
last 0 37 3
week 0 37 3
that 0 37 3
he 0 37 3
would 0 37 3
do 0 37 3
just 0 37 3
that. 0 37 3

Designating 0 37 4
the 0 37 4
IRGC 0 37 4
as 0 37 4
a 0 37 4
terrorist 0 37 4
organization 0 37 4
and 0 37 4
imposing 0 37 4
new 0 37 4
sanctions 0 37 4
for 0 37 4
its 0 37 4
aggressive 0 37 4
actions 0 37 4
in 0 37 4
the 0 37 4
region 0 37 4
is 0 37 4
not 0 37 4
a 0 37 4
restoration 0 37 4
of 0 37 4
the 0 37 4
sanctions 0 37 4
lifted 0 37 4
by 0 37 4
the 0 37 4
Obama 0 37 4
administration 0 37 4
as 0 37 4
part 0 37 4
of 0 37 4
its 0 37 4
disastrous 0 37 4
nuclear 0 37 4
deal 0 37 4
with 0 37 4
Iran. 0 37 4

If 0 37 5
Iran 0 37 5
insists 0 37 5
it 0 37 5
can 0 37 5
do 0 37 5
what 0 37 5
it 0 37 5
wants 0 37 5
militarily 0 37 5
in 0 37 5
terms 0 37 5
of 0 37 5
missile 0 37 5
launches, 0 37 5
support 0 37 5
of 0 37 5
terrorist 0 37 5
groups 0 37 5
such 0 37 5
as 0 37 5
Hezbollah 0 37 5
and 0 37 5
Hamas, 0 37 5
and 0 37 5
arms 0 37 5
transfers 0 37 5
without 0 37 5
violating 0 37 5
the 0 37 5
nuclear 0 37 5
deal, 0 37 5
then 0 37 5
the 0 37 5
United 0 37 5
States 0 37 5
can 0 37 5
certainly 0 37 5
act 0 37 5
to 0 37 5
curb 0 37 5
such 0 37 5
activities 0 37 5
through 0 37 5
financial 0 37 5
pressure. 0 37 5

The 0 37 6
U.S. 0 37 6
can 0 37 6
impose 0 37 6
sanctions 0 37 6
against 0 37 6
the 0 37 6
Iranian 0 37 6
regime’s 0 37 6
principal 0 37 6
instrument 0 37 6
for 0 37 6
projecting 0 37 6
aggressive, 0 37 6
destabilizing 0 37 6
force 0 37 6
outside 0 37 6
of 0 37 6
its 0 37 6
borders 0 37 6
without 0 37 6
violating 0 37 6
the 0 37 6
nuclear 0 37 6
deal. 0 37 6

The 0 37 7
Iranian 0 37 7
regime 0 37 7
does 0 37 7
not 0 37 7
see 0 37 7
it 0 37 7
that 0 37 7
way, 0 37 7
however. 0 37 7

With 0 37 8
the 0 37 8
lifting 0 37 8
of 0 37 8
the 0 37 8
nuclear-related 0 37 8
sanctions 0 37 8
making 0 37 8
available 0 37 8
billions 0 37 8
of 0 37 8
dollars 0 37 8
to 0 37 8
Iran’s 0 37 8
leaders 0 37 8
to 0 37 8
further 0 37 8
finance 0 37 8
the 0 37 8
IRGC’s 0 37 8
exploits 0 37 8
in 0 37 8
Iraq, 0 37 8
Syria, 0 37 8
Lebanon, 0 37 8
Yemen 0 37 8
and 0 37 8
elsewhere, 0 37 8
the 0 37 8
regime 0 37 8
is 0 37 8
furious 0 37 8
that 0 37 8
the 0 37 8
Trump 0 37 8
administration 0 37 8
is 0 37 8
tightening 0 37 8
the 0 37 8
financial 0 37 8
screws 0 37 8
again, 0 37 8
even 0 37 8
if 0 37 8
for 0 37 8
reasons 0 37 8
not 0 37 8
directly 0 37 8
related 0 37 8
to 0 37 8
Iran’s 0 37 8
compliance 0 37 8
with 0 37 8
the 0 37 8
terms 0 37 8
of 0 37 8
the 0 37 8
nuclear 0 37 8
deal. 0 37 8

Thus, 1 37 9
it 1 37 9
is 1 37 9
threatening 1 37 9
U.S. 1 37 9
forces 1 37 9
and 1 37 9
bases 1 37 9
in 1 37 9
the 1 37 9
region. 1 37 9

A 0 37 10
couple 0 37 10
of 0 37 10
seemingly 0 37 10
unrelated 0 37 10
events 0 37 10
this 0 37 10
past 0 37 10
week 0 37 10
point 1 37 10
to 1 37 10
Iran’s 1 37 10
positioning 1 37 10
itself 1 37 10
for 1 37 10
more 1 37 10
aggressive 1 37 10
military 1 37 10
actions 1 37 10
that 1 37 10
could 1 37 10
place 1 37 10
U.S. 1 37 10
forces 1 37 10
in 1 37 10
harm’s 1 37 10
way. 1 37 10

On 0 37 11
Tuesday, 0 37 11
Major 0 37 11
General 0 37 11
Bagheri 0 37 11
landed 0 37 11
in 0 37 11
Damascus 0 37 11
for 0 37 11
talks 0 37 11
with 0 37 11
Syrian 0 37 11
President 0 37 11
Bashar 0 37 11
Assad 0 37 11
and 0 37 11
senior 0 37 11
Syrian 0 37 11
officials, 0 37 11
including 0 37 11
the 0 37 11
defense 0 37 11
minister 0 37 11
and 0 37 11
the 0 37 11
chief 0 37 11
of 0 37 11
staff 0 37 11
of 0 37 11
the 0 37 11
Syrian 0 37 11
armed 0 37 11
forces. 0 37 11

Bagheri 0 37 12
is 0 37 12
quoted 0 37 12
as 0 37 12
saying 0 37 12
that 0 37 12
his 0 37 12
visit’s 0 37 12
purpose 0 37 12
was 0 37 12
to 0 37 12
“put 0 37 12
a 0 37 12
joint 0 37 12
strategy 0 37 12
on 0 37 12
continuing 0 37 12
co-ordination 0 37 12
and 0 37 12
co-operation 0 37 12
at 0 37 12
the 0 37 12
military 0 37 12
level.” 0 37 12
Some 0 37 12
experts 0 37 12
on 0 37 12
Iran 0 37 12
believe 0 37 12
that 0 37 12
Bagheri’s 0 37 12
visit 0 37 12
to 0 37 12
Damascus 0 37 12
at 0 37 12
this 0 37 12
time 0 37 12
is 0 37 12
intended 0 37 12
to 0 37 12
reinforce 0 37 12
a 0 37 12
message 0 37 12
that 0 37 12
Iran 0 37 12
will 0 37 12
continue 0 37 12
to 0 37 12
supply 0 37 12
weaponry 0 37 12
to 0 37 12
Syria 0 37 12
and 0 37 12
to 0 37 12
reinforce 0 37 12
the 0 37 12
presence 0 37 12
of 0 37 12
its 0 37 12
terrorist 0 37 12
proxy 0 37 12
Hezbollah 0 37 12
in 0 37 12
Syria. 0 37 12

This 1 37 13
will 1 37 13
not 1 37 13
only 1 37 13
serve 1 37 13
to 1 37 13
bolster 1 37 13
the 1 37 13
Assad 1 37 13
regime, 1 37 13
but 1 37 13
it 1 37 13
also 1 37 13
will 1 37 13
strengthen 1 37 13
Iran's 1 37 13
ability 1 37 13
to 1 37 13
follow 1 37 13
through 1 37 13
on 1 37 13
its 1 37 13
threats 1 37 13
to 1 37 13
the 1 37 13
U.S. 1 37 13
and 1 37 13
its 1 37 13
allies, 1 37 13
principally 1 37 13
Israel. 1 37 13

Meanwhile, 0 37 14
following 0 37 14
the 0 37 14
departure 0 37 14
of 0 37 14
the 0 37 14
Kurds 0 37 14
from 0 37 14
Kirkuk, 0 37 14
Iraq 0 37 14
earlier 0 37 14
this 0 37 14
week, 0 37 14
the 0 37 14
IRGC’s 0 37 14
operational 0 37 14
Al 0 37 14
Qods 0 37 14
arm 0 37 14
reportedly 0 37 14
established 0 37 14
a 0 37 14
command 0 37 14
center 0 37 14
and 0 37 14
five 0 37 14
bases 0 37 14
there. 0 37 14

According 0 37 15
to 0 37 15
Debkafile, 0 37 15
this 0 37 15
constitutes 0 37 15
“the 0 37 15
first 0 37 15
military 0 37 15
facility 0 37 15
Iran 0 37 15
has 0 37 15
ever 0 37 15
established 0 37 15
openly 0 37 15
in 0 37 15
Iraq.” 0 37 15
The 0 37 15
Kirkuk 0 37 15
region 0 37 15
holds 0 37 15
45 0 37 15
percent 0 37 15
of 0 37 15
Iraqi’s 0 37 15
oil. 0 37 15

The 1 37 16
Iraqi 1 37 16
branch 1 37 16
of 1 37 16
Iran’s 1 37 16
terrorist 1 37 16
proxy 1 37 16
Hezbollah 1 37 16
has 1 37 16
vowed 1 37 16
that 1 37 16
once 1 37 16
ISIS 1 37 16
is 1 37 16
defeated 1 37 16
it 1 37 16
will 1 37 16
start 1 37 16
killing 1 37 16
Americans, 1 37 16
as 1 37 16
it 1 37 16
has 1 37 16
done 1 37 16
before. 1 37 16

It 0 37 17
is 0 37 17
against 0 37 17
this 0 37 17
backdrop 0 37 17
that 0 37 17
U.S. 0 37 17
ambassador 0 37 17
to 0 37 17
the 0 37 17
United 0 37 17
Nations 0 37 17
Nikki 0 37 17
Haley 0 37 17
used 0 37 17
her 0 37 17
entire 0 37 17
speech 0 37 17
to 0 37 17
the 0 37 17
UN 0 37 17
Security 0 37 17
Council 0 37 17
on 0 37 17
Wednesday 0 37 17
to 0 37 17
denounce 0 37 17
the 0 37 17
Iranian 0 37 17
regime 0 37 17
on 0 37 17
multiple 0 37 17
grounds. 0 37 17

The 0 37 18
session 0 37 18
was 0 37 18
supposed 0 37 18
to 0 37 18
be 0 37 18
devoted 0 37 18
to 0 37 18
the 0 37 18
Israeli-Palestinian 0 37 18
conflict, 0 37 18
but 0 37 18
Ambassador 0 37 18
Haley 0 37 18
departed 0 37 18
from 0 37 18
the 0 37 18
monthly 0 37 18
ritual 0 37 18
during 0 37 18
which 0 37 18
Israel 0 37 18
is 0 37 18
normally 0 37 18
singled 0 37 18
out 0 37 18
for 0 37 18
criticism 0 37 18
by 0 37 18
other 0 37 18
Council 0 37 18
members. 0 37 18

She 0 37 19
went 0 37 19
after 0 37 19
Iran 0 37 19
instead. 0 37 19

She 0 37 20
explained 0 37 20
why 0 37 20
the 0 37 20
Trump 0 37 20
administration 0 37 20
decided 0 37 20
to 0 37 20
take 0 37 20
“a 0 37 20
comprehensive 0 37 20
approach 0 37 20
to 0 37 20
confronting 0 37 20
the 0 37 20
Iranian 0 37 20
regime,” 0 37 20
which 0 37 20
does 0 37 20
not 0 37 20
give 0 37 20
the 0 37 20
regime 0 37 20
a 0 37 20
get 0 37 20
out 0 37 20
of 0 37 20
jail 0 37 20
free 0 37 20
card 0 37 20
even 0 37 20
if 0 37 20
it 0 37 20
is 0 37 20
in 0 37 20
technical 0 37 20
compliance 0 37 20
with 0 37 20
the 0 37 20
loophole-ridden 0 37 20
nuclear 0 37 20
deal 0 37 20
agreed 0 37 20
to 0 37 20
by 0 37 20
the 0 37 20
Obama 0 37 20
administration. 0 37 20

“We 0 37 21
can’t 0 37 21
talk 0 37 21
about 0 37 21
stability 0 37 21
in 0 37 21
the 0 37 21
Middle 0 37 21
East 0 37 21
without 0 37 21
talking 0 37 21
about 0 37 21
Iran,” 0 37 21
Ambassador 0 37 21
Haley 0 37 21
said. 0 37 21

“That’s 0 37 22
because 0 37 22
nearly 0 37 22
every 0 37 22
threat 0 37 22
to 0 37 22
peace 0 37 22
and 0 37 22
security 0 37 22
in 0 37 22
the 0 37 22
Middle 0 37 22
East 0 37 22
is 0 37 22
connected 0 37 22
to 0 37 22
Iran’s 0 37 22
outlaw 1 37 22
behavior. 1 37 22

The 0 37 23
United 0 37 23
States 0 37 23
has 0 37 23
now 0 37 23
embarked 0 37 23
on 0 37 23
a 0 37 23
course 0 37 23
that 0 37 23
attempts 0 37 23
to 0 37 23
address 0 37 23
all 0 37 23
aspects 0 37 23
of 0 37 23
Iran’s 0 37 23
destructive 0 37 23
conduct, 0 37 23
not 0 37 23
just 0 37 23
one 0 37 23
aspect. 0 37 23

It’s 0 37 24
critical 0 37 24
that 0 37 24
the 0 37 24
international 0 37 24
community 0 37 24
do 0 37 24
the 0 37 24
same. 0 37 24

Judging 0 37 25
Iran 0 37 25
by 0 37 25
the 0 37 25
narrow 0 37 25

Ambassador 0 37 28

accused 0 37 28
the 0 37 28
Iranian 0 37 28
regime 0 37 28
of 0 37 28
continuing 0 37 28

“Iran 0 37 29

proceeded 0 37 32
to 0 37 32

She 0 37 33

what 0 37 33
she 0 37 33
called 0 37 33

regime’s 1 37 33
“most 1 37 33

its 0 37 33

“If 1 37 35

is 1 37 35
wrong 1 37 35

that 0 37 41

a 1 37 43
modicum 1 37 43
of 1 37 43

thanks 0 37 44
to 0 37 44
the 0 37 44

to 0 37 45
build 0 37 45
out 0 37 45

the 0 37 46
nuclear 0 37 46
deal, 0 37 46
the 0 37 46
JCPOA 0 37 46
may 0 37 46
provide 0 37 46
a 0 37 46
loophole 0 37 46
for 0 37 46
Iran 0 37 46
to 0 37 46
exploit 0 37 46
in 0 37 46

currency, 0 37 46
which 0 37 46
North 0 37 46
Korea 0 37 46
desperately 0 37 46
needs. 0 37 46

They 1 37 47
are 1 37 47
a 1 37 47
perfect 1 37 47

Proponents 0 37 48
of 0 37 48
the 0 37 48

argue 0 37 48
that 0 37 48

to 0 37 48
the 0 37 48
Trump 0 37 48

kill 0 37 48
