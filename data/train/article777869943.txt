A 0 314 1
New 0 314 1
Mexico 0 314 1
couple 0 314 1
told 0 314 1
authorities 0 314 1
months 0 314 1
ago 0 314 1
they 0 314 1
thought 0 314 1
a 0 314 1

Georgia 0 314 1
boy 0 314 1
and 0 314 1
his 1 314 1
fugitive 1 314 1

filthy 1 314 1

But 0 314 2
police 0 314 2
did 0 314 2
not 0 314 2
carry 0 314 2
out 0 314 2
a 0 314 2

because 0 314 2
they 0 314 2

That 0 314 3
delay 0 314 3
is 0 314 3
facing 0 314 3

"They 1 314 4

were 1 314 5

"Even 1 314 6

When 0 314 48
I 0 314 48
would 0 314 48
ask 0 314 48
him 0 314 48
where 0 314 48
he 0 314 48
