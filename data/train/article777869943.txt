A 0 228 1
New 0 228 1
Mexico 0 228 1
couple 0 228 1
told 0 228 1
authorities 0 228 1
months 0 228 1

they 0 228 1
thought 0 228 1
a 0 228 1

and 0 228 1
his 1 228 1

But 0 228 2

not 0 228 2
carry 0 228 2
out 0 228 2

because 0 228 2
they 0 228 2

That 0 228 3

"They 1 228 4

with 0 228 5

"Even 1 228 6

Ramzi, 0 228 44
could 0 228 44
not 0 228 44

"My 0 228 46
husband 0 228 46

Abdul-Ghani 0 228 46
to 0 228 46
the 0 228 46

That 0 228 47
was 0 228 47
in 0 228 47
November 0 228 47

When 0 228 48
I 0 228 48
would 0 228 48
ask 0 228 48
him 0 228 48
where 0 228 48
he 0 228 48

way, 0 228 48
he 0 228 48

just 0 228 48
keeping 0 228 48
him 0 228 48
for 0 228 48
the 0 228 48

But 0 228 49
I 0 228 49
haven't 0 228 49

and 0 228 50
requires 0 228 50
constant 0 228 50
medical 0 228 50
attention. 0 228 50

was 1 228 51
possessed 1 228 51
by 1 228 51
the 1 228 51
