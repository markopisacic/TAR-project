Couple 0
question 0
why 1
police 1
waited 1
so 1
long 1
to 1
search 1
New 1
Mexico 1
compound 1

(CNN) 0
A 0
New 0
Mexico 0
couple 0
told 0
authorities 0
months 0
ago 0
they 0
thought 0
a 0
missing 0
Georgia 0
boy 0
and 0
his 1
fugitive 1
father 1
were 0
living 0
in 0
a 1
filthy 1
compound 1
on 0
their 0
property. 0

But 0
police 0
did 0
not 0
carry 0
out 0
a 0
search 0
of 0
the 0
property 0
until 0
last 0
week, 0
Taos 0
County 0
Sheriff 0
Jerry 0
Hogrefe 0
said, 0
because 0
they 0
did 0
not 0
believe 0
they 0
had 0
probable 0
cause 0
in 0
the 0
case. 0

That 0
delay 0
is 0
facing 0
scrutiny 0
in 0
the 0
wake 0
of 0
Monday's 0
discovery 0
of 0
a 0
young 0
boy's 0
remains 0
at 0
the 0
compound. 0

"They 1
were 1
dragging 1
their 1
feet. 1

They 1
were 1
taking 1
too 1
long," 1
said 0
Tanya 0
Badger, 0
who 0
with 0
her 0
husband, 0
Jason, 0
told 0
authorities 0
about 0
the 0
boy's 0
suspected 0
presence 0
at 0
the 0
compound. 0

"Even 1
if 1
they 1
were 1
trying 1
to 1
build 1
a 1
case 1
or 1
whatnot, 1
a 1
child's 1
life 1
is 1
at 1
stake." 1

It's 0
not 0
clear 0
whether 0
the 0
remains 0
are 0
those 0
of 0
Abdul-Ghani 0
Wahhaj, 0
a 0
child 0
with 0
severe 0
medical 0
problems 0
who 0
disappeared 0
from 0
Georgia 0
about 0
nine 0
months 0
ago. 0

The 0
remains 0
were 0
discovered 0
in 0
a 1
wretched 1
compound 1
along 0
with 0
11 0
starving 0
children, 0
authorities 0
said. 0

More 0
details 0
about 0
the 1
horrid 1
compound 1
could 0
be 0
revealed 0
Wednesday 0
when 0
the 0
five 0
adults 0
arrested 0
from 0
the 0
site 0
make 0
their 0
first 0
court 0
appearances. 0

Authorities 0
raided 0
the 0
compound 0
in 0
Amalia, 0
New 0
Mexico, 0
on 0
Friday 0
as 0
part 0
of 0
their 0
search 0
for 0
Abdul-Ghani, 0
whose 0
father, 0
Siraj 0
Wahhaj, 0
allegedly 0
abducted 0
him 0
from 0
Georgia 0
in 0
November. 0

Neighbors 0
raised 1
alarm 1
about 0
a 0
suspect 0

The 0
Badgers 0
, 0
whose 0
land 0
the 0
compound 0
was 0
on, 0
said 0
they 0
saw 0
a 0
boy 0
they 0
thought 0
was 0
Abdul-Ghani 0
in 0
January 0
and 0
February. 0

In 0
April, 0
they 0
discovered 0
the 0
boy 0
was 0
listed 0
as 0
missing 0
and 0
his 0
father 0
a 0
fugitive. 0

They 0
reported 0
the 0
sightings 0
to 0
state 0
and 0
local 0
law 0
enforcement, 0
but 0
it 0
was 0
months 0
before 0
police 0
moved 0
in, 0
the 0
couple 0
said. 0

"We 1
are 1
just 1
beyond 1
frustrated 1
that 1
they 1
took 1
so 1
long," 1
Tanya 0
Badger 0
said. 0

New 0
Mexico 0
authorities 0
had 0
suspected 0
the 0
father 0
and 0
son 0
might 0
be 0
at 0
the 0
compound 0
after 0
learning 0
about 0
the 0
abduction 0
in 0
May, 0
the 0
sheriff 0
said. 0

But 0
there 0
was 0
not 0
enough 0
evidence 0
for 0
a 0
search 0
warrant, 0
and 0
surveillance 0
of 0
the 0
property 0
didn't 0
identify 0
the 0
pair 0
there. 0

"I 0
had 0
no 0
probable 0
cause 0
to 0
go 0
onto 0
this 0
property," 0
Hogrefe 0
said. 0

"In 0
hindsight 0
I 0
wish 0
there 0
was, 0
but 0
we 0
would 0
not 0
have 0
been 0
there 0
lawfully." 0

The 0
sheriff 0
said 0
that 0
"they 0
did 0
surveillance, 0
both 0
ground 0
and 0
aerial, 0
and 0
photographs 0
were 0
shared 0
with 0
the 0
family 0
and 0
mother 0
of 0
the 0
missing 0
boy. 0

The 0
boy 0
Abdul 0
was 0
never 0
identified 0
from 0
those 0
photos. 0

Moving 0
forward 0
we 0
knew 0
that 0
there 0
was 0
this 0
compound, 0
but 0
we 0
had 0
very 0
little 0
details 0
about 0
it 0
or 0
who 0
was 0
occupying 0
it. 0

These 0
people 0
just 0
kind 0
of 0
(sprang) 1
up 1
very 0
quickly." 0

The 0
authorities' 0
view 0
changed 0
Thursday 0
when 0
they 0
said 0
they 0
received 0
a 0
message 0
about 0
possible 0
starving 0
children 0
living 0
on 0
the 0
compound, 0
and 0
had 0
enough 0
probable 0
cause 0
to 0
put 0
in 0
an 0
affidavit 0
for 0
a 0
search 0
warrant. 0

"We 0
are 0
starving 0
and 0
need 0
food 0
and 0
water," 0
the 0
message 0
said, 0
according 0
to 0
authorities. 0

Authorities 0
said 0
it 0
was 0
forwarded 0
to 0
them 0
but 0
did 0
not 0
provide 0
details 0
on 0
its 0
origin. 0

Compound 1
wasn't 1
searched 1
thoroughly, 1
couple 0
say 0

When 0
officers 0
executed 0
a 0
search 0
warrant 0
on 0
the 0
compound, 0
they 0
found 0
a 1
horrifying 1
scene. 1

Stacks 0
of 0
tires, 0
piles 0
of 0
trash 0
and 0
plastic 0
sheets 0
surrounded 0
the 0
compound. 0

Obscured 0
by 0
the 0
junk 0
was 0
a 0
trailer 0
where 0
the 0
11 0
children 0
and 0
five 0
adults 0
were 0
living. 0

The 0
children 0
wore 0
dirty 1
rags 1
for 0
clothing 0
with 0
no 0
shoes, 0
and 0
were 0
surrounded 0
by 0
weapons 0
and 0
rounds 0
of 0
ammunition, 0
authorities 0
said. 0

"It 1
was 1
the 1
saddest 1
living 1
conditions 1
and 1
poverty 1
I 1
have 1
seen," 1
Hogrefe 0
said. 0

The 0
father 0
of 0
the 0
missing 0
boy, 0
Siraj 0
Wahhaj, 0
was 0
arrested 0
at 0
the 0
compound 0
Friday 0
along 0
with 0
his 0
sisters 0
Hujrah 0
Wahhaj 0
and 0
Subhannah 0
Wahhaj 0
and 0
two 0
other 0
adults 0
-- 0
Lucas 0
Morten 0
and 0
Jany 0
Leveille. 0

All 0
have 0
been 0
charged 0
with 0
abuse 0
of 0
the 0
11 0
children. 0

Morten 0
was 0
charged 0
with 0
harboring 0
a 0
fugitive. 0

However, 1
the 1
Badgers 1
said 1
that 1
police 1
did 1
not 1
do 1
a 1
thorough 1
job 1
searching 1
the 1
property. 1

The 0
couple 0
said 0
they 0
went 0
back 0
over 0
the 0
weekend 0
after 0
they 0
found 0
out 0
Abdul-Ghani 0
wasn't 0
among 0
the 0
11 0
children 0
discovered 0
during 0
the 0
raid. 0

Tanya 0
and 0
Jason 0
Badger 0
said 0
they 0
told 0
authorities 0
they 0
had 0
seen 0
a 0
boy 0
they 0
thought 0
was 0
Abdul-Ghani 0
Wahhaj. 0

They 1
said 1
they 1
were 1
surprised 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
scene 1
was 1
not 1
taped 1
off 1
and 1
was 1
still 1
largely 1
untouched. 1

They 1
found 1
two 1
guns, 1
ammo, 1
tactical 1
vests 1
and 1
video 1
cameras 1
that 1
police 1
initially 1
missed, 1
Jason 1
Badger 1
said. 1

"When 1
we 1
first 1
went 1
up 1
there, 1
nothing 1
was 1
overturned," 1
he 1
said. 1

"You 1
could 1
tell 1
nobody 1
had 1
looked 1
underneath 1
that, 1
nobody 1
had 1
looked 1
underneath 1
this." 1

Father 1
allegedly 1
took 1
boy 1
in 1
November 1

Abdul-Ghani's 0
mother, 0
Hakima 0
Ramzi, 0
could 0
not 0
be 0
reached 0
after 0
authorities 0
announced 0
the 0
discovery 0
of 0
the 0
remains. 0

But 0
hours 0
earlier, 0
Ramzi 0
told 0
CNN 0
she 0
had 0
no 0
idea 0
he'd 0
disappear 0
with 0
their 0
son 0
for 0
nine 0
months, 0
only 0
to 0
be 0
found 0
across 0
the 0
country 0
with 0
11 0
other 0
children 0

"My 0
husband 0
said 0
he 0
was 0
taking 0
Abdul-Ghani 0
to 0
the 0
park, 0
and 0
didn't 0
come 0
back. 0

That 0
was 0
in 0
November 0
2017. 0

When 0
I 0
would 0
ask 0
him 0
where 0
he 0
was, 0
he 0
said 0
he 0
was 0
on 0
his 0
way, 0
he 0
was 0
coming 0
soon, 0
he 0
was 0
just 0
keeping 0
him 0
for 0
the 0
night. 0

But 0
I 0
haven't 0
seen 0
him 0
since 0
then," 0
Ramzi 0
said 0
Tuesday. 0

She 0
said 0
her 0
son 0
cannot 0
walk 0
and 0
suffers 0
seizures, 0
and 0
requires 0
constant 0
medical 0
attention. 0

An 0
arrest 0
warrant 0
states 0
that 0
Wahhaj 0
"wanted 1
to 1
perform 1
an 1
exorcism" 1
on 0
the 0
child 0
because 0
he 0
believed 0
he 1
was 1
possessed 1
by 1
the 1
devil. 1

But 0
Ramzi 0
said 0
her 0
husband 0
was 0
planning 0
to 0
perform 0
a 0
ruqya 0
-- 0
an 0
Islamic 0
practice 0
involving 0
prayer 0
that 0
is 0
believed 0
to 0
help 0
rid 0
a 0
body 0
of 0
illness. 0

"It's 0
not 0
an 0
exorcism. 0

That 0
was 0
a 0
translation 0
issue 0
in 0
the 0
court," 0
Ramzi 0
said. 0

He 0
"just 0
wanted 0
to 0
pray 0
for 0
Abdul-Ghani 0
to 0
get 0
better." 0

Police 0
stopped 0
the 0
father 0
in 0
Alabama 0

In 0
December, 0
days 0
after 0
Ramzi 0
reported 0
her 0
son 0
missing, 0
the 0
child's 0
father 0
was 0
involved 0
in 0
an 0
accident 0
in 0
Alabama, 0
according 0
to 0
a 0
police 0
report. 0

The 0
SUV 0
had 0
seven 0
children 0
-- 0
but 0
none 0
of 0
them 0
was 0
listed 0
with 0
Abdul-Ghani's 0
date 0
of 0
birth. 0

Siraj 0
Wahhaj 0
is 0
accused 0
of 0
fleeing 0
Georgia 0
with 0
his 0
young 0
son. 0

But 0
at 0
the 0
time, 0
the 0
group 0
told 0
Alabama 0
police 0
they 0
were 0
headed 0
to 0
New 0
Mexico 0
for 0
camping, 0
and 0
continued 0
on 0
their 0
way. 0

Even 0
though 0
the 0
boy 0
was 0
reported 0
missing, 0
there 0
was 0
no 0
child 0
abduction 0
warrant 0
against 0
Wahhaj 0
because 0
he 0
was 0
married 0
to 0
his 0
son's 0
mother, 0
and 0
they 0
both 0
had 0
equal 0
custody, 0
Clayton 0
County 0
police 0
said. 0

The 0
SUV 0
was 0
registered 0
to 0
Leveille, 0
who 0
was 0
also 0
in 0
the 0
vehicle. 0

She 0
would 0
later 0
become 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
five 0
adults 0
arrested 0
at 0
the 0
compound 0
in 0
New 0
Mexico. 0

The 0
children 0
were 0
taken 0
into 0
protective 0
custody 0
and 0
later 0
turned 0
over 0
to 0
the 0
New 0
Mexico 0
Children, 0

Department. 0
