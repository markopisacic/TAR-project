The 0
case 0
of 0
Amber 0
Guyger, 0
the 0
police 0
officer 0
who 0
admitted 0
to 0
shooting 0
26-year-old 0
Botham 0
Jean 0
in 0
his 0
apartment 0
for 0
no 0

is 0
a 0
glaring 0
example 0
of 0
“blue 1
privilege” 1
at 0
work 0
in 0
our 1
society. 1

Guyger 0
claims 0
that 0
she 0
accidentally 0
entered 0
the 0
wrong 0
apartment 0
and 0
shot 0
a 0
man 0
who 0
she 0
thought 0
was 0
a 0
burglar, 0
however, 0
eyewitness 0
testimony 0
has 0
contradicted 0
her 0
initial 0
statement. 0

Despite 0
admitting 0
to 0
killing 0
an 0
innocent 1
man 0
and 0
having 0
her 0
initial 0
statement 0
contradicted 0
by 0
witness 0
testimony, 0
Guyger 0
has 0
been 0
treated 0
as 0
more 0
of 0
a 0
victim 0
than 0
a 0
killer. 0

In 0
fact, 0
Guyger’s 0
apartment 0
was 0
never 0
even 0
searched 0
for 0
evidence, 0
and 0
she 0
was 0
allowed 0
to 0
“vacate” 0
the 0
premises 0
without 0
any 0
type 0
of 0
search. 0

By 0
not 0
searching 0
her 0
apartment 0
immediately, 0
police 0
ruined 0
the 0
investigation, 0
making 0
it 0
harder 0
to 0
prosecute 0
her. 0

It 0
would 0
be 0
reasonable 0
to 0
assume 0
that 0
these 0
steps 0
were 0
taken 0
intentionally 0
because 1
they 1

her 1

Botham 0
Jean, 0
the 0
actual 0
victim, 0
had 0
his 0
house 0

immediately. 0

Police 0
claim 0

found 0
a 0
very 0
small 0
amount 0
of 0
marijuana, 0

the 0

It 0
is 0
obvious 0
in 0
this 0

that 0
Guyger 0
is 0
receiving 0
special 0
treatment, 0
not 0
only 0
did 0
she 0
get 0
away 0
without 0
a 0

but 0
she 0
turned 0
herself 0
in 0
at 0
her 0
own 0
convenience 0
and 0
was 0
let 0
out 0
two 0

even 0
the 0

There 0
has 0
also 0
been 0

over 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
Guyger 0
has 0
been 0
charged 0
with 0
manslaughter 0
instead 0
of 0
murder, 0
which 0
will 0
make 0
it 0
possible 0
for 0
her 0
