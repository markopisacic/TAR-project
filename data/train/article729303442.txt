the 0

Suzanne 0
Fortier, 0
“appears 0

The 0
controversy 0
has 0
its 0
roots 0
in 0

long-running 0

over 0
the 0
anti-Israel 0
Boycott, 0
Divestment 0

when 0
they 0
got 0
to 0
Lew, 0
the 0
only 0
Jewish 0
director, 0
he 0
was 0
rejected 0
105 0

In 0

“My 1
Jewish 1

over 0
his 0

His 0

which 0

Rather, 0
he 0

two 0

after 0
the 0

apologized 0
for 0

material 0
that 0
was 0
“insensitive 0
to 0

of 1

people 1
as 0

and 0

powerful.” 0

The 1
Jewish 1
groups 1
said 1
this 1
anti-Semitic 1
rhetoric 1
“was 1
used 1
to 1
encourage 1
students 1
to 1
vote 1
specifically 1
against 1
Noah 1
Lew. 1

It 1
is 1
under 1
this 1
context 1
that 1
the 1
(general 1
assembly) 1
occurred, 1
and 1
the 1
report 1
fundamentally 1
misunderstands 1
this, 1
which 1
alters 1
the 1

say 0
Boudreau’s 0

“insinuates 0
that 0

permitted 0

Michael 0
Mostyn, 0
CEO 0
of 0
B’nai 0
Brith 0
Canada, 0
called 0
the 0
report 0
a 1
whitewash. 1

“The 0
