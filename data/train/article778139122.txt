John, 0
what 0
is 0
the 0
latest 0
we 0
know 0
about 0
how 0
Julian 0
Assange 0
is 0
being 0
treated 0
and 0
his 0
current 0
state? 0

John 0
Pilger: 0
His 0
state 0
of 0
health 0
is 0
just 0
about 0
the 0
same, 0
as 0
I 0
understand 0
it. 0

He 0
needs 0
medical 0
attention, 0
the 0
kind 0
of 0
treatment 0
you 0
get 0
only 0
in 0
a 0
hospital. 0

But 0
it 0
has 0
been 0
made 0
clear 0
to 0
him 0
that 0
if 0
he 0
attempts 0
to 0
go 0
to 0
a 0
hospital 0
he 0
will 0
not 0
be 0
given 0
free 0
passage 0
and 0
he 0
will 0
be 0
arrested. 0

Since 0
he 0
was 0
arrested 0
in 0
2010, 0
Assange 0
has 0
not 0
been 0
charged 0
with 0
a 0
single 0
crime. 0

His 0
treatment 0
amounts 0
to 0
the 1
most 1
unprecedented 1
persecution. 1

Julian 0
could 0
leave 0
the 0
embassy 0
if 0
his 1
own 1
government, 1
the 1
government 1
of 1
his 1
homeland, 1
Australia, 1
applied 1
legitimate 1
diplomatic 1
pressure 1
on 1
behalf 1
of 1
its 1
citizen. 1

We 1
must 1
ask 1
ourselves 1
why 1
this 1
hasn’t 1
happened. 1

My 0
own 0
feeling 0
is 0
that 0
there 0
is 0
a 0
great 0
deal 0
of 0
collusion 0
between 0
the 0
Australian, 0
the 0
British 0
and 0
the 0
US 0
governments–meant 0
to 0
close 0
down 0
WikiLeaks 0
completely 0
and/or 0
deliver 0
Julian 0
Assange 0
to 0
the 0
Americans. 0

Recently 0
the 0
Australian 0
foreign 0
minister, 0
Julie 0
Bishop, 0
traveled 0
with 0
senior 0
officials 0
to 0
London 0
and 0
to 0
Washington 0
and 0
raised 0
the 0
whole 0
matter 0
of 0
Julian. 0

But 0
they 0
raised 0
it 0
in 0
a 0
way 0
that 0
didn’t 0
support 0
the 0
idea 0
that 0
a 0
government 0
should 0
represent 0
its 0
citizens. 0

These 0
people 0
listened 0
to 0
the 0
more 0
powerful 0
governments. 0

In 0
Washington 0
they 0
met 0
Mr. 0
Pompeo, 0
who 0
refused 0
to 0
discuss 0
Assange 0
altogether. 0

I 0
think 0
there 0
is 0
collusion 0
which 0
amounts 0
to 0
an 0
attempt 0
to 0
try 0
to 0
do 0
a 0
deal 0
with 0
Assange 0
whereby 0
he 0
might 0
be 0
allowed 0
free 0
passage 0
of 0
return 0
to 0
Australia 0
if 0
he 0
shuts 0
down 0
WikiLeaks. 0

I 0
think 0
that 0
is 0
very, 0
very 0
likely. 0

As 0
I 0
understand 0
Julian, 0
this 0
is 0
something 1
he 1
would 1
not 1
even 1
contemplate. 1

But 0
that 0
might 0
be 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
so-called 0
“wretched 1
deals” 1
that 0
are 0
being 0
offered 0
Assange. 0

Some 0
very 0
strange 0
things 0
are 0
being 0
said 0
by 0
senior 0
members 0
of 0
these 0
two 0
governments. 0

The 0
new 0
foreign 0
secretary 0
of 0
the 0
United 0
Kingdom, 0
Jeremy 0
Hunt, 0
said 0
sarcastically 0
that 0
the 1
British 1
police 1
would 1
offer 1
Julian 1
“a 1
warm 1
welcome” 1
when 1
he 1
came 1
out, 1
when 0
he 0
would 0
face 0
serious 0
charges. 0

There 0
are 0
no 0
serious 0
charges. 0

He 0
hasn’t 0
been 0
charged 0
with 0
anything. 0

to 0
a 0
deal 0
which 0
has 0
already 0
been 0
done 0
with 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
on 0
extradition? 0

I 0
don’t 0

But 0
this 0
is 0
the 1
milieu 1
of 1
machination 1
around 0
someone 0
who 0
has 0
the 0
right 0
of 0
natural 0
justice 0
concerning 0
his 0
freedom. 0

Putting 1
aside 1
freedom 1
of 1
speech, 1
the 1
persecution 1
of 1
this 1
man 1
has 1
been 1
something 1
that 1
should 1
horrify 1
all 1
free-thinking 1
people. 1

If 1
it 1
doesn’t 1
horrify 1
us, 1
then 1
we 1
have 1
surrendered 1
something 1
very 1
valuable. 1

DB: 0
Among 0

who 0
should 0
be 0
especially 1
horrified 1
are 0
those 0
of 0
us 0
in 0
the 0
journalistic 0
community. 0

John, 0
I 0
would 0
like 0
you 0
to 0
explain 0
once 0
again 0
why 0
Julian 0
Assange 0
is 0
such 1
a 1
significant 1
journalist, 1
why 0
so 0
many 0
journalistic 0
institutions 0
have 0
collaborated 0
with 0
him 0
based 0
on 0
the 0
information 0
he 0
provided. 0

We 0
are 0
talking 0
about 0
a 1
publisher 1
and 1
reporter 1
who 1
has 1
changed 1
history. 1

JP: 0
Nothing 1
in 1
my 1
time 1
as 1
a 1
journalist 1
has 1
equaled 1
the 1
rise 1
of 1
WikiLeaks 1
and 1
its 1
extraordinary 1
impact 1
on 1
journalism. 1

It 0
is 0
probably 0
the 1
only 1
journalistic 1
organization 1
that 1
has 1
a 1
100% 1
record 1
of 1
accuracy 1
and 1
authenticity! 1

All 0
of 0
WikiLeaks’ 0
revelations 0
have 0
been 0
authentic. 0

And 0
it 0
has 0
been 0
done 0
“without 0
fear 0
or 0
favor.” 0
Although 0
there 0
has 0
been 0
a 0
concentration 0
on, 0
say, 0
the 0
release 0
of 0
the 0
Hillary 0
Clinton/Podesta 0
emails, 0
or 0
the 0
Iraq 0
and 0
Afghan 0
war 0
logs, 0
WikiLeaks 0
has 0
released 0
information 0
that 0
people 0
have 0
a 0
right 0
to 0
know 0
across 0
the 0
spectrum. 0

It 0
has 0
released 0
something 0
like 0
800,000 0
documents 0
from 0
Russia, 0
and 0
now 0
WikiLeaks 0
is 0
accused 0
of 0
being 0
an 0
agent 0
of 0
Russia! 0

WikiLeaks’ 0
journalism 0
has 0
covered 0
a 0
universal 0
space 0
and 0
that 0
is 0
the 0
first 0
time 0
this 0
has 0
happened. 0

In 0
Tunisia, 0
the 0
release 0
of 0
WikiLeaks 0
documents 0
foretold 0
the 0
Arab 0
Spring. 0

The 0
people 0
at 0
the 0
forefront 0
of 0
the 0
uprising 0
in 0
Tunisia 0
credit 0
WikiLeaks 0
for 0
informing 0
them 0
of 0
what 0
their 0
repressive 0
government 0
was 0
doing 0
behind 0
their 0
backs. 0

In 0
Venezuela, 0
WikiLeaks 0
released 0
cables 0
which 0
described 0
in 0
great 0
detail 0
how 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
intended 0
to 0
subvert 0
the 0
government 0
of 0
Hugo 0
Chavez. 0

Some 0
of 0
this 0
was 0
published 0
in 0
the 0
mainstream 0
media, 0
when 0
there 0
was 0
still 0
a 0
collaboration 0
with 0
WikiLeaks. 0

The 0
Clinton/Podesta 0
emails, 0
which 0
appear 0
to 0
have 0
made 0
a 0
number 0
of 0
people 0
resentful, 0
were 0
published 0
in 0
the 0
New 0
York 0
Times. 0

These 0
emails 0
showed 0
the 0
close 0
role 0
that 0
Hillary 0
Clinton 0
and 0
the 0
Clinton 0
Foundation 0
played 0
in 0
support 0
of 0
extreme 1
jihadism 1
in 0
the 0
Middle 0
East. 0

That 0
was 0
a 0
very 0
important 0
piece 0
of 0
information 0
for 0
people 0
to 0
know 0
and 0
understand. 0

By 0
doing 0
that, 0
WikiLeaks 0
performed 0
an 1
extraordinary 1
public 1
service, 1
while 0
at 0
the 0
same 0
time 0
making 0
some 0
very 0
serious 0
enemies. 0

Randy 0
Credico: 0
People 0
sometimes 0
forget 0
that, 0
apart 0
from 0
being 0
a 0
journalist, 0
Julian 0
Assange 0
is 0
a 0
human 0
being. 0

You 0
have 0
known 0
him 0
a 0
long 0
time. 0

Could 0
you 0
give 0
us 0
a 0
feel 0
for 0
the 0
kind 0
of 0
person 0
Julian 0
Assange 0
is? 0

JP: 0
Julian 0
is 0
a 1
very 1
principled 1
individual. 1

He 0
feels 0
very 0
strongly 0
about 0
the 0
moral 0
basis 0
of 0
WikiLeaks. 0

When 0
he 0
first 0
put 0
up 0
WikiLeaks, 0
he 0
wrote 0
that 0
the 0
whole 0
idea 0
of 0
transparency, 0
honoring 0
people’s 0
right 0
to 0
know, 0
was 0
the 0
central 0
aim 0
of 0
the 0
website. 0

He 0
feels 0
that 0
very 0
strongly. 0

Any 0
attempt 0
to 0
do 0
a 0
deal 0
with 0
Julian 0
to 0
shut 0
down 0
WikiLeaks 0
will 0
no 0
doubt 0
be 0
resisted. 0

As 0
a 0
person, 0
Julian 0
is 0
an 1
extremely 1
interesting 1
man. 1

He 0
is 0
very 0
well 0
read. 0

He 0
studied 0
physics. 0

He 0
has 0
a 0
very 0
good 0
sense 0
of 0
humor, 0
and 0
I 0
have 0
often 0
laughed 0
out 0
loud 0
with 0
him 0
about 0
situations 0
that 0
others 0
might 0
consider 0
too 0
bleak 0
to 0
discuss. 0

His 0
black 0
humor 0
is 0
a 0
part 0
of 0
his 0
survival 0
kit. 0

Obviously, 0
he 0
is 0
incredibly 0
resilient. 0

Personally, 0
I 0
could 0
never 0
endure 0
what 0
he 0
has, 0
especially 0
in 0
recent 0
years. 0

But 0
this 0
comes 0
with 0
a 0
cost 0
and 0
his 0
health 0
is 0
continuing 0
to 0
deteriorate. 0

Those 0
close 0
to 0
him 0
are 0
extremely 1
worried. 1

to 0
the 0
Australian 0
prime 0
minister, 0
Malcolm 0

Julian’s 0
father, 0
John 0

all 1
within 1
his 1
power 1
to 1

That 0

why 0
this 0

such 0
an 0
urgent 0

of 0

toward 0
a 0

right 0
to 0
function 0
and 0
our 0
right 0
to 0
have 0
the 0
information 0
it 0
provides. 0

Only 0
seven 0
years 0
ago, 0
the 0
current 0
prime 0
minister 0
said 0
that 0
when 0
an 0
Australian 0
citizen 0
is 0
threatened 0
in 0
this 0
way 0
the 0
prime 0
minister 0
should 0
respond. 0

That 0
was 0
Turnbull 0
before 0
he 0
became 0
prime 0
minister. 0

Now 0
the 0
government 0
is 0
playing 0
its 0
usual 0
role 0
of 0
being 0
the 1
fifty-first 1
state 1
of 1
the 1
United 1
States. 1

It 1
is 1
a 1
true 1
disgrace. 1

RC: 0
What 1
about 1
Theresa 1
May 1
and 1
the 1
British 1
government? 1

Are 1
they 1
getting 1
pressure 1
from 1
the 1
United 1
States 1
or 1
are 1
there 1
internal 1
reasons 1
why 1
they 1
want 1
to 1
keep 1
Julian 1
Assange 1
quiet? 1

JP: 0
Everything 0
comes 0
down 0
to 0
the 0
relationship 0
with 0
the 0
United 0
States. 0

Australia 0
has 0
an 1
almost 1
totally 1
servile 1
relationship 1
with 0
America, 0
in 0
which 0
its 0
national 0
security 0
structure, 0
much 0
of 0
its 0
academic 0
life 0
and 0
certainly 0
much 0
of 0
its 0
media 0
is 0
integrated 0
into 0
the 0
US 0
system. 0

That 0
is 0
not 0
entirely 0
the 0
case 0
in 0
Britain. 0

Since 0
the 0
loss 0
of 0
its 0
empire 0
after 0
the 0
Second 0
World 0
War, 0
Britain 0
has 0
been 0
eager 0
to 0
play 0
a 0
secondary 0
role 0
to 0
the 0
new 0
imperial 0
power. 0

In 0
many 0
parts 0
of 0
the 0
world, 0
Britain 0
is 0
still 0
the 0
biggest 0
corporate 0
investor. 0

But 0
it 1
does 1
move 1
in 1
lockstep 1
with 1
the 1
US 1
on 0
much 0
of 0
its 0
foreign 0
policy. 0

It 0
is 0
interesting 0
to 0
see 0
the 0
corruption 0
that 0
this 0
kind 0
of 0
relationship 0
produces. 0

Information 0
has 0
come 0
out 0
that 0
the 0
Crown 0
Prosecution 0
Service 0
tried 0
to 0
prevent 0
the 0
Swedes 0
from 0
giving 0
up 0
the 0
case 0
against 0
Julian 0
on 0
bogus 1
sexual 1
assault 1
charges. 1

The 0
pressure 0
was 0
on 0
from 0
London 0
to 0
keep 0
it 0
going. 0

Julian 0
is 0
also 0
seen 0
as 0
defying 0
a 0
system 0
and 0
that 0
is 0
just 0
not 0
acceptable. 0

There 0
is 0
a 0
real 0
element 0
of 0
vindictiveness 0
here. 0

The 0
Crown 0
Prosecution 0
Service 0
kept 0
this 0
case 0
going 0
when 0
otherwise 0
the 0
European 0
warrant 0
put 0
out 0
by 0
the 0
Swedes 0
would 0
have 0
been 0
abandoned 0
in 0
2013. 0

When 0
Julian 0
came 0
up 0
to 0
a 0
bail 0
hearing 0
last 0
year, 0
it 1
was 1
an 1
absolute 1
disgrace. 1

The 0
judge 0
described 0
Julian’s 0
circumstances 0
as 0
if 0
he 0
were 0
on 0
some 0
sort 0
of 0
extended 0
vacation. 0

What 1
didn’t 1
emerge 1
was 1
the 1
whole 1
conflict 1
of 1
interest 1
in 1
this 1
hearing. 1

The 1
judge’s 1
husband 1
is 1
a 1
figure 1
deep 1
within 1
the 1
national 1
security 1
establishment 1
in 1
Britain 1
who 1
was 1
named 1
in 1
WikiLeaks 1
documents. 1

Because 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
serious 1
media 1
examining 1
the 1
whole 1
WikiLeaks 1
witch 1
hunt, 1
virtually 1
none 1
of 1
this 1
emerges. 1

DB: 0
The 0
corporate 0
press 0
has 0
a 0
major 0
responsibility 0
if 0
Julian 0
Assange 0
goes 0
down, 0
don’t 0
you 0
agree? 0

JP: 0
As 0
you 0
know, 0
Dennis, 0
governments 0
do 0
respond 0
to 0
pressure 0
from 0
powerful 0
media 0
interests. 0

It 0
rarely 0
happens 0
but 0
when 0
it 0
does 0
governments 0
do 0
change 0
their 0
tune. 0

There 0
has 0
been 0
no 0
pressure 0
from 0
media 0
in 0
the 0
United 0
States, 0
Britain, 0
Australia 0
or 0
pretty 0
much 0
anywhere 0
except 0
in 0
programs 0
like 0
yours 0
outside 0

mainstream. 0

You 1
are 1

that 0
the 0
responsibility 0
of 0
journalists 0
for 0
what 0
has 0
happened 0
to 0
Julian 0
Assange 0
and 0
what 0
might 0

this 0

a 0
report 0
by 0

Lens 0
in 0
Britain 0
describing 0
how 0
the 0
British 0
press 0
has 0
reported 0
on 0
Julian 0
Assange. 0

It 0
describes 0
the 1
tsunami 1
of 1
vindictive 1
personal 1
abuse 1
that 0
has 0
been 0
heaped 1
upon 1
Julian 0
from 0
well-known 0
journalists, 0
many 0
claiming 0
liberal 0
credentials. 0

The 0
Guardian, 0
which 1
used 1
to 1
consider 1
itself 1
the 1

the 0

I 0
have 0
been 0
a 0
journalist 0
for 0
a 0
very 0
long 0
time 0
and 0
I 0
have 0
always 0
worked 0
within 0
the 0

but 0
the 0
journalism 0
I 0
see 0
now 0
is 0
part 0

establishment 1
and 0
one 0
of 0
its 0
prime 0
targets 0
is 0
Julian 0
Assange 0
and 0
WikiLeaks. 0

This 1
is 1
precisely 1
because 1
WikiLeaks 1
is 1
producing 1
the 1
kind 1
of 1
journalism 1
that 1
they 1
ought 1
to 1
be 1
doing. 1

WikiLeaks 0
has 0
in 0

which 0
might 0
help 0
to 0
explain 0
the 0
deeply 1
personal 1
abuse 1
he 0
has 0
suffered. 0

DB: 0
Even 0
the 0

New 0

to 0
mention 0
that 0
if 0
Julian 0
Assange 0
gets 0
prosecuted, 0
the 0
Times 0
could 0
get 0
prosecuted 0
under 0
the 0

laws. 0

JP: 0
It 0
could 0
but 0
I 0
don’t 0
believe 0
it 0
would 0
be, 0
because 0
power 1
respects 1
power. 1

The 0
New 0

Times 0
is 0
part 0
of 0
the 0

The 0
difference 0
with 0
WikiLeaks 0
is 0
that 0
it 0
is 0
outside 0
of 0
the 0
establishment 0
and 0
is 0
truly 0
independent. 0

DB: 0
What 0
would 0
be 0
your 0
strongest 0
plea 0
for 0
Julian 0
Assange? 0

JP: 0
It’s 0
very 0
simple. 0

This 0
is 0
about 0
justice. 0

In 0
a 0
famous 0
speech 0
given 0
in 0
the 0
1930’s 0
by 0
Parson 0
Martin 0
Niemoller, 0
he 0
said 0
that 0
first 0
the 0
Nazis 0
came 0
for 0
socialists, 0
but 0
he 0
didn’t 0
speak 0
up 0
because 0
that 0
didn’t 0
concern 0
him. 0

Then 0
they 0
came 0
for 0
trade 0
unionists, 0
but 0
he 0
didn’t 0
speak 0
up 0
because 0
that 0
didn’t 0
concern 0
him. 0

He 0
didn’t 0
speak 0
up 0
when 0
they 0
came 0
for 0
the 0
Jews 0
because 0
he 0
wasn’t 0
a 0
Jew. 0

And, 0
of 0
course, 0
finally 0
they 0
came 0
for 0
him. 0

That 0
might 0
not 0
be 0
a 0
precise 0
parallel, 0
but 0
if 1
Julian 1
Assange 1
is 1
allowed 1
to 1
literally 1
go 1
under, 1
it 1
represents 1
the 1
conquest 1
of 1
all 1
of 1
us. 1

It 0
means 0
that 0
we 0
have 0
kept 0
quiet. 0

Keeping 0
quiet 0
has 0
allowed 0
the 1
great 1
atrocities 1
of 1
histories 1
to 0
take 0
place. 0

If 1
Julian 1
is 1
allowed 1
to 1
be 1
spirited 1
away 1
to 1
some 1
super-max 1
hellhole, 1
it 1
will 1
be 1
a 1
great 1
atrocity. 1
