I'll 0
Say 0
What 0
Kavanaugh 0
Wouldn't: 0
Christine 0
Ford 0
Was 0
Part 0
Of 0
The 0
Political 0
Hit 0
On 0
Him 0
& 0
Here's 0
The 0
Audio 0
Evidence 0

On 0
Thursday, 0
following 0
the 0
hearings 0
where 0
Dr. 0
Christine 0
Ford 0
provided 0
testimony 0
under 0
oath 0
without 0
any 0
evidence 0
at 0
all 0
of 0
a 0
36-year-old 0
alleged 0
sexual 0
attack 0
by 0
Supreme 0
Court 0
nominee 0
Brett 0
Kavanaugh 0
and 0
his 0
friend 0
Mark 0
Judge, 0
Kavanaugh 0
denied 0
the 0
allegations 0
and 0
blasted 1
Senate 1
Democrats 1
for 0
their 0
involvement 0
in 0
ruining 0
his 0
good 0
name. 0

However, 0
when 0
asked 0
by 0
Senator 0
Cory 0
Booker 0
whether 0
or 0
not 0
Kavanaugh 0
thought 0
Ford 0
was 0
part 0
of 0
what 0
Kavanaugh 0
referred 0
to 0
as 0
a 0
"political 1
hit" 1
against 0
him, 0
Kavanaugh 0
rightly 0
steered 0
clear 0
of 0
a 0
public 1
relations 1
disaster. 1

However, 0
I 0
am 0
willing 0
to 0
say 0
would 0
he 0
would 0
not: 0
Of 1
course, 1
she 1
was 1
part 1
of 1
it! 1

I 0
don't 0
say 0
this 0
lightly. 0

There 0
are 0
many 0
things 0
that 0
we 0
heard 0
from 0
Ford 0
on 0
Thursday 0
that 0
indicate 0
there 0
is 0
more 0
going 0
on 0
than 0
she 0
was 0
willing 0
to 0
say. 0

Clearly, 0
Ford 0
has 0
been 0
outed 0
as 0
a 1
radical 1
political 1
activist 1
who 1
promotes 1
baby 1
murder 1
and 1
other 1
unlawful 1
actions. 1

However, 0
her 1
story 1
didn't 1
exactly 1
lend 1
credibility 1
except 0
with 0
Democrat 0
members 0
of 0
the 0
Senate 0
Judiciary 0
Committee, 0
one 0
of 0
which 0
has 0
openly 0
professed 0
to 0
sexual 0
assault. 0

former 0
Clinton 0
White 0
House 0
official 0
who 0
is 0
now 0
an 0
advisor 0
to 0
Mrs. 0
Ford, 0
said 0
in 0
July 0
(at 0
roughly 0
the 0
same 0
time 0
as 0
the 0
letter 0
was 0
submitted) 0
that 0
she 0
predicted 0
a 0
"strategy" 0
forming 0
to 1
destroy 1
Brett 1
Kavanaugh. 1

She 0
suggested 0
a 0
“strategy 0
will 0
emerge” 0
to 1
destroy 1
Trump's 1
nomination 1
for 1
the 1
Supreme 1
Court 1
in 0
a 0
conference 0
call 0
with 0
the 0
American 0
Constitution 0
Society 0
in 0
July. 0

“I 0
do 0
think 0
that 0
over 0
the 0
coming 0
days 0
and 0
weeks 0
there 0
will 0
be 0
a 0
strategy 0
that 0
will 0
emerge, 0
and 0
I 0
think 0
it’s 0
possible 0
that 0
strategy 0
might 0
ultimately 0
defeat 0
the 0
nominee,” 0
Seidman 0
said 0
in 0
audio 0
that 0
was 0
recorded 0
by 0
the 0
Republican 0
National 0
Committee’s 0
War 0
Room. 0

“And 1
whether 1
or 1
not 1
it 1
ultimately 1
defeats 1
the 1
nominee 1
it 1
will, 1
I 1
think, 1
help 1
people 1
understand 1
why 1
it’s 1
so 1
important 1
that 1
they 1
vote.” 1

If 1
you 1
think 1
Mrs. 1
Ford 1
is 1
ignorant 1
of 1
this 1
considering 1
her 1
father 1
works 1
for 1
the 1
Central 1
Intelligence 1
Agency 1
and 1
her 1
prior 1
criminal 1
political 1
activism, 1
then 1
you 1
aren't 1
thinking 1
clearly. 1

Ford 1
obviously 1
has 1
mental 1
issues 1
and 1
that 1
was 1
on 1
display 1
on 1
Thursday 1
during 1
her 1
testimony. 1

She 0
clearly 0
tried 0
to 0
present 0
herself 0
as 0
a 0
victim 0
while 0
she 0
accused 0
Kavanaugh 0
of 0
sexual 0
assault 0
with 0
absolutely 1
no 1
evidence. 1

Kavanaugh 0
even 0
responded 0
by 0
pointing 0
out 0
that 0
even 0
her 0
friends 0
said 0
they 0
don't 0
recall 0
such 0
an 0
incident 0
and 0
had 0
literally 0
hundreds 0
of 0
people 0
commend 0
his 0
character 0
as 0
the 0
direct 0
opposite 0
of 0
what 0
Ford 0
claims. 0

As 0
I've 0
said 0
before, 0
I 0
don't 0
support 0
Kavanaugh's 0
appointment 0
to 0
the 0
Supreme 0
Court 0
on 0
the 0
grounds 0
of 0
lack 0
of 0
constitutional 0
rulings, 0
but 0
that 1
attack 1
on 1
him 1
was 1
orchestrated, 1
it 1
was 1
political 1
and 1
Ford 1
was 1
a 1
part 1
of 1
it. 1

It's 0
wrong. 0

Ford 0
didn't 0
even 0
think 0
to 0
act, 0
according 0
to 0
her 0
testimony, 0
until 0
Kavanaugh 0
was 0
on 0
the 0
short 0
list, 0
but 1
did 1
she 1
go 1
to 1
local 1
law 1
enforcement? 1

Nope. 0

She 0
went 0
to 0
her 0
US 0
Democrat 0
representative, 0
Senator 0
Dianne 0
Feinstein 0
and 0
The 0
Washington 0
Post. 0

If 0
that 0
is 0
not 0
political, 0
I 0
don't 0
know 0
what 0
is. 0

Ford 1
is 1
not 1
seeking 1
justice 1
nor 1
is 1
she 1
seeking 1
to 1
do 1
her 1
"civic 1
duty." 1

She 1
is 1
seeking 1
to 1
slander 1
a 1
man's 1
character 1
for 1
something 1
she 1
cannot 1
prove 1
that 1
she 1
claims 1
happened 1
over 1
36 1
years 1
ago. 1

Kavanaugh's 0
