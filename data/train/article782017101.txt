Cardinal 0
Theodore 0
McCarrick: 0
Yet 0
Another 0
Fruit 0
of 0
Vatican 0
II 0

Still, 0
we’re 0
also 0
averse 0
to 0
speaking 0
in 0
terms 0
of 0
good 0
and 0
evil. 0

Right 0
and 0
wrong? 0

Maybe. 0

But 0
good 0
and 0
evil 0
have 0
a 0
supernatural 0
ring 0
we 0
usually 0
reserve 0
for 0
dramatic 0
and 0
abominable 1
crimes, 0
like 0
genocide. 1

Yet 1
everything 1
right 1
is 1
good, 1
and 1
everything 1
wrong 1
is 1
evil. 1

The 0
evils 0
we 0
encounter 0
in 0
our 0
day-to-day 0
lives 0
might 0
not 0
be 0
a 0
spectacle, 0
like 0
jihadists 0
beheading 0
a 0
journalist 0
on 0
live 0
television. 0

All 0
the 0
same, 0
evil 0
is 0
part 0
of 0
ordinary 0
life. 0

It 0
dwells 0
deep 0
in 0
our 0
hearts 0
– 0
each 0
and 0
every 0
one 0
of 0
us. 0

The 0
Prince 1
of 1
this 1
World 1
has 0
made 0
a 0
grand 0
display 0
of 0
his 0
authority 0
in 0
the 0
last 0
few 0
centuries. 0

Our 0
saving 0
grace 0
is 0
that, 0
while 0
Westerners 0
no 0
longer 0
believe 0
in 0
God, 0
they 0
still 0
believe 0
in 0
the 0
Devil. 0

We’re 0
at 0
least 0
clear-eyed 0
enough 0
to 0
recognize 0
true 0
evil 0
at 0
work 0
in 0
the 0
world, 0
even 0
if 0
we 0
can 0
no 0
longer 0
see 0
the 0
great 0
Good 0
hidden 0
behind 0
the 0
veil. 0

This 0
is 0
the 0
point 0
about 0
the 0
McCarrick 0
scandal 0
that 0
even 0
religious 0
commentators 0
tend 0
to 0
overlook. 0

How 0
was 0
he 0
allowed 0
to 0
go 0
on 0
molesting 0
young 0
priests 0
and 0
seminarians 0
when 0
virtually 0
the 0
entire 0
Church 0
hierarchy 0
knew 0
what 0
he 0
was 0
up 0
to? 0

And 0
how 0
was 0
such 0
a 0
depraved 1
individual 0
ordained 0
in 0
the 0
first 0
place, 0
let 0
alone 0
promoted 0
to 0
Cardinal-Archbishop 0
of 0
Washington? 0

The 0
answer 0
is, 0
ultimately, 0
demonic. 1

As 0
Catholics, 0
we 0
ask 0
St. 0
Michael 0
to 0
“cast 0
into 0
Hell 0
Satan 0
and 0
all 0
the 0
evil 0
spirits 0
who 0
prowl 0
about 0
the 0
world 0
seeking 0
the 0
ruin 0
of 0
souls.” 0
McCarrick 0
and 0
his 0
fellow 0
perverts 1
in 0
the 0
clergy 0
are 0
responsible, 0
not 0
only 0
for 0
their 0
sexual 0
abuses, 0
but 0
also 0
for 0
chasing 0
good 0
men 0
away 0
from 0
the 0
priesthood. 0

Spend 0
enough 0
time 0
in 0
Catholic 0
World 0
and 0
you 0
inevitably 0
meet 0
good 0
men 0
who 0
quit 0
the 0
seminary 0
because 0
of 0
some 0
rampant 1
(and 0
often 0
violent) 0
depravity. 0

What 0
could 0
suit 0
the 0
Devil 0
more 0
than 0
to 0
watch 0
the 0
Church 0
burn 0
her 0
wheat 0
as 0
she 0
gathers 0
the 0
chaff? 0

The 0
gates 0
of 0
Hell 0
will 0
not 0
prevail 0
against 0
the 0
Church, 0
as 0
Our 0
Lord 0
promised. 0

But 0
they 0
won’t 0
stop 0
trying, 0
either. 0

They’ve 0
attacked 0
from 0
the 0
front, 0
sending 0
the 0
Roman 0
pagans, 0
French 0
Revolutionaries, 0
and 0
British 0
American 0
secularists. 0

They 0
flank 0
us 0
by 0
sending 0
heretics 0
like 0
Arius, 0
Luther, 0
and 0
Hans 0
Kung. 0

Today, 0
there’s 0
also 0
a 0
fifth 0
column 0
working 0
to 0
tear 0
down 0
the 0
walls 0
from 0
within 0
– 0
not 0
only 0
pedophiles 0
like 0
John 0
Geoghan, 0
but 0
also 0
predators 1
like 0
Theodore 0
McCarrick. 0

Where 0
did 0
those 0
fifth 0
columnists 0
enter? 0

Why, 0
there’s 1
only 1
one 1
possible 1
explanation: 1
the 0
Second 0
Vatican 0
Council. 0

Aggiornamento 0
sounds 0
like 0
a 0
Lefebvrist 0
slur. 0

The 0
idea 0
that 0
an 0
ecumenical 0
council 0
of 0
the 0
Catholic 0
Church 0
would 0
openly 0
seek 0
to 0
“bring 0
itself 0
up 0
to 0
date” 0
is 0
ridiculous. 0

Yet 0
that 0
was 0
precisely 0
the 0
aim. 0

As 0
St 0
Pope 0
John 0
XXIII 0
explained, 0
“Its 0
principal 0
task 0
will 0
be 0
concerned 0
with 0
the 0
conditions 0
and 0
modernization 0
of 0
the 0
Church 0
after 0
20 0
centuries 0
of 0
life.” 0
It 0
was 0
not 0
supposed 0
(as 0
some 0
have 0
claimed) 0
to 0
simply 0
update 0
the 0
liturgy 0
from 0
its 0
last 0
redesign 0
in 0
1570. 0

The 0
goal 0
was 0
to 0
align 0
the 0
Church 0
more 0
with 0
modern 0
world: 0
a 0
world 0
defined, 0
to 0
a 0
considerable 0
extent, 0
by 0
its 0
rejection 0
of 0
the 0
Catholic 0
world 0
that 0
flourished 0
before 0
the 0
Protestant 0
Reformation 0
and 0
French 0
Revolution. 0

Now, 0
I 0
don’t 0
believe 0
Pope 0
John 0
saw 0
himself 0
as 0
endangering 0
either 0
orthodoxy 0
or 0
sacred, 0
immutable 0
tradition. 0

I 0
share 0
Pope 0
Paul 0
IV’s 0
view. 0

When 0
he 0
heard 0
that 0
the 0
Council 0
was 0
being 0
convened, 0
then-Cardinal 0
Montini 0
is 0
supposed 0
to 0
have 0
sighed, 0
“This 0
holy 1
old 1
boy 1
doesn’t 0
realise 0
what 0
a 0
hornet’s 0
nest 0
he’s 0
stirring 0
up.” 0

Nonetheless, 0
he 0
stirred 0
it. 0

The 0
spirit 0
of 0
aggiornamento 0
quickly 0
spread 0
through 0
the 0
Church 0
in 0
the 0
1960s 0
– 0
and 0
the 0
seminaries 0
especially. 0

Seminarians 0
called 0
for 0
a 0
more 0
“participatory” 0
administration. 0

They 0
became 0
involved 0
in 0
socialist 0
politics. 0

They 0
formed 0
trade 0
unions 0
to 0
demand 0
the 0
right 0
to 0
marry. 0

They 0
practiced 0
sauvage 0
intercommunion. 0

Of 0
course, 0
they 0
had 0
their 0
enablers 0
in 0
the 0
hierarchy 0
as 0
well. 0

Perhaps 0
the 0
worst 0
was 0
Archbishop 0
Marty 0
of 0
Paris, 0
a 0
leader 0
of 0
the 0
“priest-worker 0
movement” 0
who 0
defended 0
Marxist 0
and 0
existentialist 0
atheisms 0
on 0
the 0
floor 0
of 0
the 0
Council. 0

During 0
a 0
homily 0
at 0
the 0
Cathedral, 0
he 0
also 0
praised 0
the 0
soixantehuitards: 0
“the 0
great 0
outburst 0
of 0
the 0
younger 0
generation 0
that 0
suddenly 0
wanted 0
to 0
take 0
its 0
place 0
in 0
life” 0
that 0
occurred 0
in 0
his 0
city 0
in 0
May 0
of 0
1968. 0

“One 0
also 0
felt 0
that, 0
in 0
these 0
events 0
of 0
May,” 0
Marty 0
continued, 0
“the 0
seriousness 0
of 0
the 0
working 0
class, 0
which 0
wants 0
not 0
only 0
to 0
earn 0
a 0
living 0
wage, 0
but 0
also 0
to 0
find 0
its 0
freedom, 0
its 0
independence.” 0
Theaggiornamentistas 0
was 0
never 0
purged 0
from 0
the 0
Church, 0
and 0
certainly 0
not 0
from 0
the 0
seminaries. 0

As 0
the 0
modern 0
world 0
continued 0
to 0
reject 0
traditional 0
Christian 0
mores, 0
so 0
too 0
does 0
the 0
Church 0
seem 0
increasingly 0
“out 0
of 0
step” 0
and 0
in 0
need 0
of 0
“modernizing”. 0

Inevitably, 0
this 0
came 0
to 0
mean 0
the 0
acceptance 0
of 0
homosexuality. 0

Bishop 0
Wilton 0
D. 0
Gregory, 0
as 0
president 0
of 0
the 0
U.S. 0
Conference 0
of 0
Catholic 0
Bishops, 0
infamously 0
spoke 0
of 0
“an 0
ongoing 0
struggle 0
to 0
make 0
sure 0
that 0
the 0
Catholic 0
priesthood 0
is 0
not 0
dominated 0
by 0
homosexual 0
men.” 0

But 0
that 0
predominance 0
has 0
very 0
little 0
to 0
do 0
with 0
homosexuality 0
per 0
se. 0

Rather, 0
the 0
1960s 0
rejection 0
of 0
celibacy 0
in 0
the 0
seminaries 0
naturally 0
provided 0
more 0
(shall 0
we 0
say) 0
opportunities 0
for 0
gay 0
men 0
– 0
given 0
that 0
there 0
are, 0
of 0
course, 0
no 0
women 0
in 0
Catholic 0
seminaries. 0

This 0
began 0
driving 0
away 0
heterosexuals, 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
homosexuals 0
who 0
upheld 0
the 0
Church’s 0
teachings 0
on 0
chastity 0
and 0
celibacy. 0

Needless 0
to 0
say, 0
not 0
all 0
gay 0
priests 0
are 0
violent 1
predators 1
like 0
McCarrick. 0

But 0
the 0
toleration 0
of 0
sexually 0
active 0
priests 0
gave 0
McCarrick 0
cover 0
to 0
“seduce” 0
his 0
victims. 0

Many 0
have 0
also 0
speculated 0
that, 0
because 0
McCarrick’s 0
victims 0
were 0
overwhelmingly 0
above 0
the 0
age 0
of 0
consent, 0
the 0
media 0
didn’t 0
consider 0
them 0
newsworthy. 0

If 0
he’d 0
fondled 0
a 0
12-year 0
old 0
altar 0
boy, 0
that 0
would 0
have 0
been 0
one 0
thing. 0

Pedophile 1
priests 1
sell 1
papers. 1

But 0
taking 0
an 0
18-year-old 0
seminarian 0
to 0
bed? 0

Running 0
that 0
story 0
would 0
simply 0
be 0
outing 0
a 0
closeted 1
gay 1
man: 1
an 0
act 0
the 0
liberal 0
press 0
would 0
no 0
doubt 0
consider 0
“homophobic”, 0
as 0
Ross 0
Douthat 0
pointed 0
out. 0

Meanwhile, 0
those 0
bishops 0
who 0
didn’t 0
approve 0
of 0
his 0
actions 0
knew 0
the 0
culture 0
– 0
both 0
within 0
the 0
Church 0
and 0
without 0
her 0
– 0
were 0
against 0
them. 0

The 0
post-Vatican 0
Church 0
doesn’t 0
like 0
to 0
come 0
off 0
as 0
a 0
nag. 0

She’s 0
not 0
going 0
to 0
cause 0
a 0
fuss 0
by 0
purging 0
sexually 0
active 0
gay 0
men 0
from 0
the 0
clergy 0
just 0
because… 0
what? 0

It’s 0
immoral? 0

That’s 0
not 0
very 0
aggiornamentistic! 0

The 0
world 0
and 0
our 0
worldly 0
bishops 0
were, 0
unsurprisingly, 0
of 0
one 0
mind. 0

And 0
even 0
if 0
they 0
were 0
disgusted 0
by 0
McCarrick, 0
these 0
prelates 0
weren’t 0
willing 0
to 0
jeopardize 0
their 0
careers 0
by 0
standing 0
for 0
justice 0
against 0
vice. 0

We 0
seem 0
to 0
be 0
slouching 0
back 0
to 0
the 0
old 0
traditionalist 0
trope: 0
All 0
the 0
Church’s 0
problems 0
would 0
be 0
solved 0
if 0
we’d 0
just 0
go 0
back 0
to 0
the 0
Latin 0
Mass. 0

Something 0
went 0
critically 1
wrong 1
during 0
Vatican 0
II 0
that 0
extends 0
well 0
beyond 0
the 0
Mass. 0

And 0
we 0
can’t 0
drag 0
the 0
Church 0
out 0
of 0
her 0
present 0
crisis 0
until 0
we 0
have 0
the 0
courage 0
to 0
brave 0
accusations 0
of 0
“Lefebvrism” 0
and 0
say 0
so. 0

Those 0
who 0
love 0
our 0
Holy 0
Mother 0
– 0
those 0
who 0
want 0
to 0
protect 0
her 0
boys 0
and 0
men 0
from 0
all 0
the 0
McCarricks 0
and 0
their 0
perverse 1
appetites 0
– 0
mustn’t 0
be 0
deceived 0
into 0
thinking 0
this 0
is 0
a 0
small 0
or 0
an 0
isolated 0
issue. 0

It 0
isn’t. 0

This 0
is 0
the 0
crisis 0
of 0
an 0
ancient 0
and 0
immortal 0
institution 0
trying 0
desperately 0
to 0
seem 0
young 0
and 0
fashionable; 0
like 0
all 0
old 0
men, 0
it 0
only 0
manages 0
to 0
come 0
across 0
as 0
lecherous 1
and 1
pathetic. 1

Its 0
obsession 0
with 0
“modernization” 0
leads 0
it 0
to 0
only 0
adopt 0
the 0
vices 0
of 0
modernity. 0

Instead 0
of 0
serving 0
as 0
ambassadors 0
from 0
the 0
City 0
of 0
God, 0
far 0
too 0
many 0
of 0
our 0
priests 0
and 0
prelates 0
have 0
become 0
agents 0
of 0
the 0
City 0
of 0
Man. 0

I 0
don’t 0
know 0
what 0
it 0
will 0
take 0
to 0
set 0
things 0
right. 0

I 1
don’t 1
know 1
what 1
it 1
will 1
take 1
to 0
exorcise 0
the 0
“spirit 0
of 0
Vatican 0
II” 0
– 0
the 0
spirit 0
of 0
aggiornamento 0
– 0
from 0
the 0
Church. 0

But 0
we 1
will. 1

Christ 0
promised. 0
