Cardinal 0 330 0
Theodore 0 330 0
McCarrick: 0 330 0
Yet 0 330 0
Another 0 330 0
Fruit 0 330 0
of 0 330 0
Vatican 0 330 0
II 0 330 0

Still, 0 330 1
we’re 0 330 1
also 0 330 1
averse 0 330 1
to 0 330 1
speaking 0 330 1
in 0 330 1
terms 0 330 1
of 0 330 1
good 0 330 1
and 0 330 1
evil. 0 330 1

Right 0 330 2
and 0 330 2
wrong? 0 330 2

Maybe. 0 330 3

But 0 330 4
good 0 330 4
and 0 330 4
evil 0 330 4
have 0 330 4
a 0 330 4
supernatural 0 330 4
ring 0 330 4
we 0 330 4
usually 0 330 4
reserve 0 330 4
for 0 330 4
dramatic 0 330 4
and 0 330 4
abominable 1 330 4
crimes, 0 330 4
like 0 330 4
genocide. 1 330 4

Yet 1 330 5
everything 1 330 5
right 1 330 5
is 1 330 5
good, 1 330 5
and 1 330 5
everything 1 330 5
wrong 1 330 5
is 1 330 5
evil. 1 330 5

The 0 330 6
evils 0 330 6
we 0 330 6
encounter 0 330 6
in 0 330 6
our 0 330 6
day-to-day 0 330 6
lives 0 330 6
might 0 330 6
not 0 330 6
be 0 330 6
a 0 330 6
spectacle, 0 330 6
like 0 330 6
jihadists 0 330 6
beheading 0 330 6
a 0 330 6
journalist 0 330 6
on 0 330 6
live 0 330 6
television. 0 330 6

All 0 330 7
the 0 330 7
same, 0 330 7
evil 0 330 7
is 0 330 7
part 0 330 7
of 0 330 7
ordinary 0 330 7
life. 0 330 7

It 0 330 8
dwells 0 330 8
deep 0 330 8
in 0 330 8
our 0 330 8
hearts 0 330 8
– 0 330 8
each 0 330 8
and 0 330 8
every 0 330 8
one 0 330 8
of 0 330 8
us. 0 330 8

The 0 330 9
Prince 1 330 9
of 1 330 9
this 1 330 9
World 1 330 9
has 0 330 9
made 0 330 9
a 0 330 9
grand 0 330 9
display 0 330 9
of 0 330 9
his 0 330 9
authority 0 330 9
in 0 330 9
the 0 330 9
last 0 330 9
few 0 330 9
centuries. 0 330 9

Our 0 330 10
saving 0 330 10
grace 0 330 10
is 0 330 10
that, 0 330 10
while 0 330 10
Westerners 0 330 10
no 0 330 10
longer 0 330 10
believe 0 330 10
in 0 330 10
God, 0 330 10
they 0 330 10
still 0 330 10
believe 0 330 10
in 0 330 10
the 0 330 10
Devil. 0 330 10

We’re 0 330 11
at 0 330 11
least 0 330 11
clear-eyed 0 330 11
enough 0 330 11
to 0 330 11
recognize 0 330 11
true 0 330 11
evil 0 330 11
at 0 330 11
work 0 330 11
in 0 330 11
the 0 330 11
world, 0 330 11
even 0 330 11
if 0 330 11
we 0 330 11
can 0 330 11
no 0 330 11
longer 0 330 11
see 0 330 11
the 0 330 11
great 0 330 11
Good 0 330 11
hidden 0 330 11
behind 0 330 11
the 0 330 11
veil. 0 330 11

This 0 330 12
is 0 330 12
the 0 330 12
point 0 330 12
about 0 330 12
the 0 330 12
McCarrick 0 330 12
scandal 0 330 12
that 0 330 12
even 0 330 12
religious 0 330 12
commentators 0 330 12
tend 0 330 12
to 0 330 12
overlook. 0 330 12

How 0 330 13
was 0 330 13
he 0 330 13
allowed 0 330 13
to 0 330 13
go 0 330 13
on 0 330 13
molesting 0 330 13
young 0 330 13
priests 0 330 13
and 0 330 13
seminarians 0 330 13
when 0 330 13
virtually 0 330 13
the 0 330 13
entire 0 330 13
Church 0 330 13
hierarchy 0 330 13
knew 0 330 13
what 0 330 13
he 0 330 13
was 0 330 13
up 0 330 13
to? 0 330 13

And 0 330 14
how 0 330 14
was 0 330 14
such 0 330 14
a 0 330 14
depraved 1 330 14
individual 0 330 14
ordained 0 330 14
in 0 330 14
the 0 330 14
first 0 330 14
place, 0 330 14
let 0 330 14
alone 0 330 14
promoted 0 330 14
to 0 330 14
Cardinal-Archbishop 0 330 14
of 0 330 14
Washington? 0 330 14

The 0 330 15
answer 0 330 15
is, 0 330 15
ultimately, 0 330 15
demonic. 1 330 15

As 0 330 16
Catholics, 0 330 16
we 0 330 16
ask 0 330 16
St. 0 330 16
Michael 0 330 16
to 0 330 16
“cast 0 330 16
into 0 330 16
Hell 0 330 16
Satan 0 330 16
and 0 330 16
all 0 330 16
the 0 330 16
evil 0 330 16
spirits 0 330 16
who 0 330 16
prowl 0 330 16
about 0 330 16
the 0 330 16
world 0 330 16
seeking 0 330 16
the 0 330 16
ruin 0 330 16
of 0 330 16
souls.” 0 330 16
McCarrick 0 330 16
and 0 330 16
his 0 330 16
fellow 0 330 16
perverts 1 330 16
in 0 330 16
the 0 330 16
clergy 0 330 16
are 0 330 16
responsible, 0 330 16
not 0 330 16
only 0 330 16
for 0 330 16
their 0 330 16
sexual 0 330 16
abuses, 0 330 16
but 0 330 16
also 0 330 16
for 0 330 16
chasing 0 330 16
good 0 330 16
men 0 330 16
away 0 330 16
from 0 330 16
the 0 330 16
priesthood. 0 330 16

Spend 0 330 17
enough 0 330 17
time 0 330 17
in 0 330 17
Catholic 0 330 17
World 0 330 17
and 0 330 17
you 0 330 17
inevitably 0 330 17
meet 0 330 17
good 0 330 17
men 0 330 17
who 0 330 17
quit 0 330 17
the 0 330 17
seminary 0 330 17
because 0 330 17
of 0 330 17
some 0 330 17
rampant 1 330 17
(and 0 330 17
often 0 330 17
violent) 0 330 17
depravity. 0 330 17

What 0 330 18
could 0 330 18
suit 0 330 18
the 0 330 18
Devil 0 330 18
more 0 330 18
than 0 330 18
to 0 330 18
watch 0 330 18
the 0 330 18
Church 0 330 18
burn 0 330 18
her 0 330 18
wheat 0 330 18
as 0 330 18
she 0 330 18
gathers 0 330 18
the 0 330 18
chaff? 0 330 18

The 0 330 19
gates 0 330 19
of 0 330 19
Hell 0 330 19
will 0 330 19
not 0 330 19
prevail 0 330 19
against 0 330 19
the 0 330 19
Church, 0 330 19
as 0 330 19
Our 0 330 19
Lord 0 330 19
promised. 0 330 19

But 0 330 20
they 0 330 20
won’t 0 330 20
stop 0 330 20
trying, 0 330 20
either. 0 330 20

They’ve 0 330 21
attacked 0 330 21
from 0 330 21
the 0 330 21
front, 0 330 21
sending 0 330 21
the 0 330 21
Roman 0 330 21
pagans, 0 330 21
French 0 330 21
Revolutionaries, 0 330 21
and 0 330 21
British 0 330 21
American 0 330 21
secularists. 0 330 21

They 0 330 22
flank 0 330 22
us 0 330 22
by 0 330 22
sending 0 330 22
heretics 0 330 22
like 0 330 22
Arius, 0 330 22
Luther, 0 330 22
and 0 330 22
Hans 0 330 22
Kung. 0 330 22

Today, 0 330 23
there’s 0 330 23
also 0 330 23
a 0 330 23
fifth 0 330 23
column 0 330 23
working 0 330 23
to 0 330 23
tear 0 330 23
down 0 330 23
the 0 330 23
walls 0 330 23
from 0 330 23
within 0 330 23
– 0 330 23
not 0 330 23
only 0 330 23
pedophiles 0 330 23
like 0 330 23
John 0 330 23
Geoghan, 0 330 23
but 0 330 23
also 0 330 23
predators 1 330 23
like 0 330 23
Theodore 0 330 23
McCarrick. 0 330 23

Where 0 330 24
did 0 330 24
those 0 330 24
fifth 0 330 24
columnists 0 330 24
enter? 0 330 24

Why, 0 330 25
there’s 1 330 25
only 1 330 25
one 1 330 25
possible 1 330 25
explanation: 1 330 25
the 0 330 25
Second 0 330 25
Vatican 0 330 25
Council. 0 330 25

Aggiornamento 0 330 26
sounds 0 330 26
like 0 330 26
a 0 330 26
Lefebvrist 0 330 26
slur. 0 330 26

The 0 330 27
idea 0 330 27
that 0 330 27
an 0 330 27
ecumenical 0 330 27
council 0 330 27
of 0 330 27
the 0 330 27
Catholic 0 330 27
Church 0 330 27
would 0 330 27
openly 0 330 27
seek 0 330 27
to 0 330 27
“bring 0 330 27
itself 0 330 27
up 0 330 27
to 0 330 27
date” 0 330 27
is 0 330 27
ridiculous. 0 330 27

Yet 0 330 28
that 0 330 28
was 0 330 28
precisely 0 330 28
the 0 330 28
aim. 0 330 28

As 0 330 29
St 0 330 29
Pope 0 330 29
John 0 330 29
XXIII 0 330 29
explained, 0 330 29
“Its 0 330 29
principal 0 330 29
task 0 330 29
will 0 330 29
be 0 330 29
concerned 0 330 29
with 0 330 29
the 0 330 29
conditions 0 330 29
and 0 330 29
modernization 0 330 29
of 0 330 29
the 0 330 29
Church 0 330 29
after 0 330 29
20 0 330 29
centuries 0 330 29
of 0 330 29
life.” 0 330 29
It 0 330 29
was 0 330 29
not 0 330 29
supposed 0 330 29
(as 0 330 29
some 0 330 29
have 0 330 29
claimed) 0 330 29
to 0 330 29
simply 0 330 29
update 0 330 29
the 0 330 29
liturgy 0 330 29
from 0 330 29
its 0 330 29
last 0 330 29
redesign 0 330 29
in 0 330 29
1570. 0 330 29

The 0 330 30
goal 0 330 30
was 0 330 30
to 0 330 30
align 0 330 30
the 0 330 30
Church 0 330 30
more 0 330 30
with 0 330 30
modern 0 330 30
world: 0 330 30
a 0 330 30
world 0 330 30
defined, 0 330 30
to 0 330 30
a 0 330 30
considerable 0 330 30
extent, 0 330 30
by 0 330 30
its 0 330 30
rejection 0 330 30
of 0 330 30
the 0 330 30
Catholic 0 330 30
world 0 330 30
that 0 330 30
flourished 0 330 30
before 0 330 30
the 0 330 30
Protestant 0 330 30
Reformation 0 330 30
and 0 330 30
French 0 330 30
Revolution. 0 330 30

Now, 0 330 31
I 0 330 31
don’t 0 330 31
believe 0 330 31
Pope 0 330 31
John 0 330 31
saw 0 330 31
himself 0 330 31
as 0 330 31
endangering 0 330 31
either 0 330 31
orthodoxy 0 330 31
or 0 330 31
sacred, 0 330 31
immutable 0 330 31
tradition. 0 330 31

I 0 330 32
share 0 330 32
Pope 0 330 32
Paul 0 330 32
IV’s 0 330 32
view. 0 330 32

When 0 330 33
he 0 330 33
heard 0 330 33
that 0 330 33
the 0 330 33
Council 0 330 33
was 0 330 33
being 0 330 33
convened, 0 330 33
then-Cardinal 0 330 33
Montini 0 330 33
is 0 330 33
supposed 0 330 33
to 0 330 33
have 0 330 33
sighed, 0 330 33
“This 0 330 33
holy 1 330 33
old 1 330 33
boy 1 330 33
doesn’t 0 330 33
realise 0 330 33
what 0 330 33
a 0 330 33
hornet’s 0 330 33
nest 0 330 33
he’s 0 330 33
stirring 0 330 33
up.” 0 330 33

Nonetheless, 0 330 34
he 0 330 34
stirred 0 330 34
it. 0 330 34

The 0 330 35
spirit 0 330 35
of 0 330 35
aggiornamento 0 330 35
quickly 0 330 35
spread 0 330 35
through 0 330 35
the 0 330 35
Church 0 330 35
in 0 330 35
the 0 330 35
1960s 0 330 35
– 0 330 35
and 0 330 35
the 0 330 35
seminaries 0 330 35
especially. 0 330 35

Seminarians 0 330 36
called 0 330 36
for 0 330 36
a 0 330 36
more 0 330 36
“participatory” 0 330 36
administration. 0 330 36

They 0 330 37
became 0 330 37
involved 0 330 37
in 0 330 37
socialist 0 330 37
politics. 0 330 37

They 0 330 38
formed 0 330 38
trade 0 330 38
unions 0 330 38
to 0 330 38
demand 0 330 38
the 0 330 38
right 0 330 38
to 0 330 38
marry. 0 330 38

They 0 330 39
practiced 0 330 39
sauvage 0 330 39
intercommunion. 0 330 39

Of 0 330 40
course, 0 330 40
they 0 330 40
had 0 330 40
their 0 330 40
enablers 0 330 40
in 0 330 40
the 0 330 40
hierarchy 0 330 40
as 0 330 40
well. 0 330 40

Perhaps 0 330 41
the 0 330 41
worst 0 330 41
was 0 330 41
Archbishop 0 330 41
Marty 0 330 41
of 0 330 41
Paris, 0 330 41
a 0 330 41
leader 0 330 41
of 0 330 41
the 0 330 41
“priest-worker 0 330 41
movement” 0 330 41
who 0 330 41
defended 0 330 41
Marxist 0 330 41
and 0 330 41
existentialist 0 330 41
atheisms 0 330 41
on 0 330 41
the 0 330 41
floor 0 330 41
of 0 330 41
the 0 330 41
Council. 0 330 41

During 0 330 42
a 0 330 42
homily 0 330 42
at 0 330 42
the 0 330 42
Cathedral, 0 330 42
he 0 330 42
also 0 330 42
praised 0 330 42
the 0 330 42
soixantehuitards: 0 330 42
“the 0 330 42
great 0 330 42
outburst 0 330 42
of 0 330 42
the 0 330 42
younger 0 330 42
generation 0 330 42
that 0 330 42
suddenly 0 330 42
wanted 0 330 42
to 0 330 42
take 0 330 42
its 0 330 42
place 0 330 42
in 0 330 42
life” 0 330 42
that 0 330 42
occurred 0 330 42
in 0 330 42
his 0 330 42
city 0 330 42
in 0 330 42
May 0 330 42
of 0 330 42
1968. 0 330 42

“One 0 330 43
also 0 330 43
felt 0 330 43
that, 0 330 43
in 0 330 43
these 0 330 43
events 0 330 43
of 0 330 43
May,” 0 330 43
Marty 0 330 43
continued, 0 330 43
“the 0 330 43
seriousness 0 330 43
of 0 330 43
the 0 330 43
working 0 330 43
class, 0 330 43
which 0 330 43
wants 0 330 43
not 0 330 43
only 0 330 43
to 0 330 43
earn 0 330 43
a 0 330 43
living 0 330 43
wage, 0 330 43
but 0 330 43
also 0 330 43
to 0 330 43
find 0 330 43
its 0 330 43
freedom, 0 330 43
its 0 330 43
independence.” 0 330 43
Theaggiornamentistas 0 330 43
was 0 330 43
never 0 330 43
purged 0 330 43
from 0 330 43
the 0 330 43
Church, 0 330 43
and 0 330 43
certainly 0 330 43
not 0 330 43
from 0 330 43
the 0 330 43
seminaries. 0 330 43

As 0 330 44
the 0 330 44
modern 0 330 44
world 0 330 44
continued 0 330 44
to 0 330 44
reject 0 330 44
traditional 0 330 44
Christian 0 330 44
mores, 0 330 44
so 0 330 44
too 0 330 44
does 0 330 44
the 0 330 44
Church 0 330 44
seem 0 330 44
increasingly 0 330 44
“out 0 330 44
of 0 330 44
step” 0 330 44
and 0 330 44
in 0 330 44
need 0 330 44
of 0 330 44
“modernizing”. 0 330 44

Inevitably, 0 330 45
this 0 330 45
came 0 330 45
to 0 330 45
mean 0 330 45
the 0 330 45
acceptance 0 330 45
of 0 330 45
homosexuality. 0 330 45

Bishop 0 330 46
Wilton 0 330 46
D. 0 330 46
Gregory, 0 330 46
as 0 330 46
president 0 330 46
of 0 330 46
the 0 330 46
U.S. 0 330 46
Conference 0 330 46
of 0 330 46
Catholic 0 330 46
Bishops, 0 330 46
infamously 0 330 46
spoke 0 330 46
of 0 330 46
“an 0 330 46
ongoing 0 330 46
struggle 0 330 46
to 0 330 46
make 0 330 46
sure 0 330 46
that 0 330 46
the 0 330 46
Catholic 0 330 46
priesthood 0 330 46
is 0 330 46
not 0 330 46
dominated 0 330 46
by 0 330 46
homosexual 0 330 46
men.” 0 330 46

But 0 330 47
that 0 330 47
predominance 0 330 47
has 0 330 47
very 0 330 47
little 0 330 47
to 0 330 47
do 0 330 47
with 0 330 47
homosexuality 0 330 47
per 0 330 47
se. 0 330 47

Rather, 0 330 48
the 0 330 48
1960s 0 330 48
rejection 0 330 48
of 0 330 48
celibacy 0 330 48
in 0 330 48
the 0 330 48
seminaries 0 330 48
naturally 0 330 48
provided 0 330 48
more 0 330 48
(shall 0 330 48
we 0 330 48
say) 0 330 48
opportunities 0 330 48
for 0 330 48
gay 0 330 48
men 0 330 48
– 0 330 48
given 0 330 48
that 0 330 48
there 0 330 48
are, 0 330 48
of 0 330 48
course, 0 330 48
no 0 330 48
women 0 330 48
in 0 330 48
Catholic 0 330 48
seminaries. 0 330 48

This 0 330 49
began 0 330 49
driving 0 330 49
away 0 330 49
heterosexuals, 0 330 49
as 0 330 49
well 0 330 49
as 0 330 49
homosexuals 0 330 49
who 0 330 49
upheld 0 330 49
the 0 330 49
Church’s 0 330 49
teachings 0 330 49
on 0 330 49
chastity 0 330 49
and 0 330 49
celibacy. 0 330 49

Needless 0 330 50
to 0 330 50
say, 0 330 50
not 0 330 50
all 0 330 50
gay 0 330 50
priests 0 330 50
are 0 330 50
violent 1 330 50
predators 1 330 50
like 0 330 50
McCarrick. 0 330 50

But 0 330 51
the 0 330 51
toleration 0 330 51
of 0 330 51
sexually 0 330 51
active 0 330 51
priests 0 330 51
gave 0 330 51
McCarrick 0 330 51
cover 0 330 51
to 0 330 51
“seduce” 0 330 51
his 0 330 51
victims. 0 330 51

Many 0 330 52
have 0 330 52
also 0 330 52
speculated 0 330 52
that, 0 330 52
because 0 330 52
McCarrick’s 0 330 52
victims 0 330 52
were 0 330 52
overwhelmingly 0 330 52
above 0 330 52
the 0 330 52
age 0 330 52
of 0 330 52
consent, 0 330 52
the 0 330 52
media 0 330 52
didn’t 0 330 52
consider 0 330 52
them 0 330 52
newsworthy. 0 330 52

If 0 330 53
he’d 0 330 53
fondled 0 330 53
a 0 330 53
12-year 0 330 53
old 0 330 53
altar 0 330 53
boy, 0 330 53
that 0 330 53
would 0 330 53
have 0 330 53
been 0 330 53
one 0 330 53
thing. 0 330 53

Pedophile 1 330 54
priests 1 330 54
sell 1 330 54
papers. 1 330 54

But 0 330 55
taking 0 330 55
an 0 330 55
18-year-old 0 330 55
seminarian 0 330 55
to 0 330 55
bed? 0 330 55

Running 0 330 56
that 0 330 56
story 0 330 56
would 0 330 56
simply 0 330 56
be 0 330 56
outing 0 330 56
a 0 330 56
closeted 1 330 56
gay 1 330 56
man: 1 330 56
an 0 330 56
act 0 330 56
the 0 330 56
liberal 0 330 56
press 0 330 56
would 0 330 56
no 0 330 56
doubt 0 330 56
consider 0 330 56
“homophobic”, 0 330 56
as 0 330 56
Ross 0 330 56
Douthat 0 330 56
pointed 0 330 56
out. 0 330 56

Meanwhile, 0 330 57
those 0 330 57
bishops 0 330 57
who 0 330 57
didn’t 0 330 57
approve 0 330 57
of 0 330 57
his 0 330 57
actions 0 330 57
knew 0 330 57
the 0 330 57
culture 0 330 57
– 0 330 57
both 0 330 57
within 0 330 57
the 0 330 57
Church 0 330 57
and 0 330 57
without 0 330 57
her 0 330 57
– 0 330 57
were 0 330 57
against 0 330 57
them. 0 330 57

The 0 330 58
post-Vatican 0 330 58
Church 0 330 58
doesn’t 0 330 58
like 0 330 58
to 0 330 58
come 0 330 58
off 0 330 58
as 0 330 58
a 0 330 58
nag. 0 330 58

She’s 0 330 59
not 0 330 59
going 0 330 59
to 0 330 59
cause 0 330 59
a 0 330 59
fuss 0 330 59
by 0 330 59
purging 0 330 59
sexually 0 330 59
active 0 330 59
gay 0 330 59
men 0 330 59
from 0 330 59
the 0 330 59
clergy 0 330 59
just 0 330 59
because… 0 330 59
what? 0 330 59

It’s 0 330 60
immoral? 0 330 60

That’s 0 330 61
not 0 330 61
very 0 330 61
aggiornamentistic! 0 330 61

The 0 330 62
world 0 330 62
and 0 330 62
our 0 330 62
worldly 0 330 62
bishops 0 330 62
were, 0 330 62
unsurprisingly, 0 330 62
of 0 330 62
one 0 330 62
mind. 0 330 62

And 0 330 63
even 0 330 63
if 0 330 63
they 0 330 63
were 0 330 63
disgusted 0 330 63
by 0 330 63
McCarrick, 0 330 63
these 0 330 63
prelates 0 330 63
weren’t 0 330 63
willing 0 330 63
to 0 330 63
jeopardize 0 330 63
their 0 330 63
careers 0 330 63
by 0 330 63
standing 0 330 63
for 0 330 63
justice 0 330 63
against 0 330 63
vice. 0 330 63

We 0 330 64
seem 0 330 64
to 0 330 64
be 0 330 64
slouching 0 330 64
back 0 330 64
to 0 330 64
the 0 330 64
old 0 330 64
traditionalist 0 330 64
trope: 0 330 64
All 0 330 64
the 0 330 64
Church’s 0 330 64
problems 0 330 64
would 0 330 64
be 0 330 64
solved 0 330 64
if 0 330 64
we’d 0 330 64
just 0 330 64
go 0 330 64
back 0 330 64
to 0 330 64
the 0 330 64
Latin 0 330 64
Mass. 0 330 64

Something 0 330 65
went 0 330 65
critically 1 330 65
wrong 1 330 65
during 0 330 65
Vatican 0 330 65
II 0 330 65
that 0 330 65
extends 0 330 65
well 0 330 65
beyond 0 330 65
the 0 330 65
Mass. 0 330 65

And 0 330 66
we 0 330 66
can’t 0 330 66
drag 0 330 66
the 0 330 66
Church 0 330 66
out 0 330 66
of 0 330 66
her 0 330 66
present 0 330 66
crisis 0 330 66
until 0 330 66
we 0 330 66
have 0 330 66
the 0 330 66
courage 0 330 66
to 0 330 66
brave 0 330 66
accusations 0 330 66
of 0 330 66
“Lefebvrism” 0 330 66
and 0 330 66
say 0 330 66
so. 0 330 66

Those 0 330 67
who 0 330 67
love 0 330 67
our 0 330 67
Holy 0 330 67
Mother 0 330 67
– 0 330 67
those 0 330 67
who 0 330 67
want 0 330 67
to 0 330 67
protect 0 330 67
her 0 330 67
boys 0 330 67
and 0 330 67
men 0 330 67
from 0 330 67
all 0 330 67
the 0 330 67
McCarricks 0 330 67
and 0 330 67
their 0 330 67
perverse 1 330 67
appetites 0 330 67
– 0 330 67
mustn’t 0 330 67
be 0 330 67
deceived 0 330 67
into 0 330 67
thinking 0 330 67
this 0 330 67
is 0 330 67
a 0 330 67
small 0 330 67
or 0 330 67
an 0 330 67
isolated 0 330 67
issue. 0 330 67

It 0 330 68
isn’t. 0 330 68

This 0 330 69
is 0 330 69
the 0 330 69
crisis 0 330 69
of 0 330 69
an 0 330 69
ancient 0 330 69
and 0 330 69
immortal 0 330 69
institution 0 330 69
trying 0 330 69
desperately 0 330 69
to 0 330 69
seem 0 330 69
young 0 330 69
and 0 330 69
fashionable; 0 330 69
like 0 330 69
all 0 330 69
old 0 330 69
men, 0 330 69
it 0 330 69
only 0 330 69
manages 0 330 69
to 0 330 69
come 0 330 69
across 0 330 69
as 0 330 69
lecherous 1 330 69
and 1 330 69
pathetic. 1 330 69

Its 0 330 70
obsession 0 330 70
with 0 330 70
“modernization” 0 330 70
leads 0 330 70
it 0 330 70
to 0 330 70
only 0 330 70
adopt 0 330 70
the 0 330 70
vices 0 330 70
of 0 330 70
modernity. 0 330 70

Instead 0 330 71
of 0 330 71
serving 0 330 71
as 0 330 71
ambassadors 0 330 71
from 0 330 71
the 0 330 71
City 0 330 71
of 0 330 71
God, 0 330 71
far 0 330 71
too 0 330 71
many 0 330 71
of 0 330 71
our 0 330 71
priests 0 330 71
and 0 330 71
prelates 0 330 71
have 0 330 71
become 0 330 71
agents 0 330 71
of 0 330 71
the 0 330 71
City 0 330 71
of 0 330 71
Man. 0 330 71

I 0 330 72
don’t 0 330 72
know 0 330 72
what 0 330 72
it 0 330 72
will 0 330 72
take 0 330 72
to 0 330 72
set 0 330 72
things 0 330 72
right. 0 330 72

I 1 330 73
don’t 1 330 73
know 1 330 73
what 1 330 73
it 1 330 73
will 1 330 73
take 1 330 73
to 0 330 73
exorcise 0 330 73
the 0 330 73
“spirit 0 330 73
of 0 330 73
Vatican 0 330 73
II” 0 330 73
– 0 330 73
the 0 330 73
spirit 0 330 73
of 0 330 73
aggiornamento 0 330 73
– 0 330 73
from 0 330 73
the 0 330 73
Church. 0 330 73

But 0 330 74
we 1 330 74
will. 1 330 74

Christ 0 330 74

promised. 0 330 74
