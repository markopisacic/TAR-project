3200 0

one 0

The 0
main 0
difference 0
between 0
asteroids 0
and 0
comets 0
is 0
their 0
composition. 0

Asteroids 0
are 0
made 0
up 0
of 0
metals 0

rocky 0
material, 0
while 0
comets 0
are 0
made 0

and 0
rocky 0
material. 0

Comets 0
which 0
approach 0
the 0
Sun 0
lose 0
material 0
with 0
each 0
orbit 0
because 0
some 0
of 0
their 0
ice 0

a 0
tail. 0

But 0
the 0
real 0
question 0
is 0
will 0
anyone 0

see 0
the 0
