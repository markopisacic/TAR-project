Michael 0 83 1
R. 0 83 1
Pompeo 0 83 1
expressed 0 83 1
confidence 0 83 1
Wednesday 0 83 1
that 0 83 1
the 0 83 1
Saudi 0 83 1
government 0 83 1
could 0 83 1
be 0 83 1
trusted 0 83 1
to 0 83 1
investigate 0 83 1
the 0 83 1
disappearance 0 83 1
and 0 83 1
suspected 0 83 1

of 0 83 1

a 0 83 1
Saudi 0 83 1
diplomatic 0 83 1
facility 0 83 1
in 0 83 1
Turkey 0 83 1
— 0 83 1
despite 0 83 1
the 0 83 1
likelihood 0 83 1
that 0 83 1
senior 0 83 1
Saudi 0 83 1
officials 0 83 1
were 0 83 1
involved. 0 83 1

Speaking 0 83 2
in 0 83 2
Ankara, 0 83 2
Turkey, 0 83 2
Pompeo 0 83 2
offered 0 83 2
that 0 83 2
support 0 83 2
hours 0 83 2
after 0 83 2
President 0 83 2
Donald 0 83 2
Trump 0 83 2
had 0 83 2
mounted 0 83 2
an 0 83 2
even 0 83 2
stronger 0 83 2
defense 0 83 2
for 0 83 2
the 0 83 2
Saudi 0 83 2
rulers, 0 83 2
saying, 0 83 2
“Here 0 83 2
we 0 83 2
go 0 83 2
again 0 83 2
with 0 83 2
you’re 0 83 2
guilty 0 83 2
until 0 83 2
proven 0 83 2
innocent.” 0 83 2

Together 0 83 3
they 0 83 3
appeared 0 83 3
to 0 83 3
signal 0 83 3
a 0 83 3
shift 0 83 3
in 0 83 3
White 0 83 3
House 0 83 3
strategy 0 83 3
— 0 83 3
earlier 0 83 3
this 0 83 3
week 0 83 3
Trump 0 83 3
had 0 83 3
warned 0 83 3
Saudi 0 83 3
rulers 0 83 3
could 0 83 3
face 0 83 3
“severe 1 83 3
punishment” 0 83 3
— 0 83 3
and 0 83 3
suggested 0 83 3
the 0 83 3
administration 0 83 3
has 0 83 3
decided 0 83 3
to 0 83 3
help 0 83 3
its 0 83 3
most 0 83 3
important 0 83 3
ally 0 83 3
in 0 83 3
the 0 83 3

Neither 0 83 5
Trump 0 83 5
nor 0 83 5
his 0 83 5
top 0 83 5

But 0 83 6
unless 0 83 6
authorities 0 83 6
recover 0 83 6
his 0 83 6

or 0 83 6
other 0 83 6
conclusive 0 83 6
evidence 0 83 6
of 0 83 6
his 0 83 6

the 0 83 6

may 0 83 6
remain 0 83 6
unsolved. 0 83 6

Pompeo 0 83 7
wrapped 0 83 7
up 0 83 7
two 0 83 7

of 0 83 7
emergency 0 83 7

on 0 83 7
Wednesday. 0 83 7

Turkish 0 83 8
officials 0 83 8
have 0 83 8
described 0 83 8
— 0 83 8
but 0 83 8
have 0 83 8
not 0 83 8

Turkish 0 83 9
officials 0 83 9
say 0 83 9
Khashoggi’s 0 83 9

was 1 83 9

up 1 83 9
with 1 83 9

on 0 83 10
Tuesday. 0 83 10

Erdogan 0 83 11
later 0 83 11
complained 0 83 11
that 0 83 11
the 0 83 11
interior 0 83 11
walls 0 83 11
had 0 83 11
been 0 83 11
repainted 0 83 11
in 0 83 11
recent 0 83 11
days. 0 83 11

On 0 83 12
his 0 83 12
flight 0 83 12
from 0 83 12
Riyadh 0 83 12
to 0 83 12
Ankara, 0 83 12
Pompeo 1 83 12
reiterated 1 83 12
his 1 83 12
confidence 1 83 12
that 1 83 12
the 1 83 12
Saudi 1 83 12
government 1 83 12
would 1 83 12
conduct 1 83 12
a 1 83 12
“thorough, 1 83 12
complete, 1 83 12
and 1 83 12
transparent 1 83 12
investigation,” 1 83 12
adding 1 83 12
that 1 83 12
they 1 83 12
will 1 83 12
“show 1 83 12
the 1 83 12
entire 1 83 12
world” 1 83 12
the 1 83 12
results. 1 83 12

He 0 83 13
said 0 83 13
Saudi 0 83 13
leaders 0 83 13
made 0 83 13
a 0 83 13
commitment 0 83 13
“to 0 83 13
hold 0 83 13
anyone 0 83 13
connected 0 83 13
to 0 83 13
any 0 83 13
wrongdoing 0 83 13
that 0 83 13
may 0 83 13
be 0 83 13
found 0 83 13
accountable 0 83 13
for 0 83 13
that, 0 83 13
whether 0 83 13
they 0 83 13
are 0 83 13
a 0 83 13
senior 0 83 13
officer 0 83 13
or 0 83 13
official.” 0 83 13
He 0 83 13
said 0 83 13
they 0 83 13
made 0 83 13
“no 0 83 13
exceptions,” 0 83 13
including 0 83 13
presumably 0 83 13
members 0 83 13
of 0 83 13
the 0 83 13
royal 0 83 13
family. 0 83 13

Asked 0 83 14
if 0 83 14
the 0 83 14
Saudis 0 83 14
had 0 83 14
informed 0 83 14
him 0 83 14
whether 0 83 14
Khashoggi 0 83 14
was 0 83 14
alive 0 83 14
or 0 83 14
dead, 0 83 14
Pompeo 0 83 14
said, 0 83 14
“I 0 83 14
don’t 0 83 14
want 0 83 14
to 0 83 14
talk 0 83 14
about 0 83 14
any 0 83 14
of 0 83 14
the 0 83 14
facts. 0 83 14

They 0 83 15
didn’t 0 83 15
want 0 83 15
to 0 83 15
either, 0 83 15
in 0 83 15
that 0 83 15
they 0 83 15
want 0 83 15
to 0 83 15
have 0 83 15
the 0 83 15
opportunity 0 83 15
to 0 83 15
complete 0 83 15
this 0 83 15
investigation 0 83 15
in 0 83 15
a 0 83 15
thorough 0 83 15
way.” 0 83 15

Asked 0 83 16
if 0 83 16
he 0 83 16
believed 0 83 16
the 0 83 16
Saudi 0 83 16
rulers’ 0 83 16
repeated 0 83 16
denial 0 83 16
of 0 83 16
complicity, 0 83 16
Pompeo 0 83 16
said 0 83 16
he 0 83 16
was 0 83 16
reserving 0 83 16
judgment. 0 83 16

“I 0 83 17
think 0 83 17
that’s 0 83 17
— 0 83 17
I 0 83 17
think 0 83 17
that’s 0 83 17
— 0 83 17
I 0 83 17
think 0 83 17
that’s 0 83 17
a 0 83 17
reasonable 0 83 17
thing 0 83 17
to 0 83 17
do, 0 83 17
to 0 83 17
give 0 83 17
them 0 83 17
that 0 83 17
opportunity,” 0 83 17
Pompeo 0 83 17
said, 0 83 17
“(and 0 83 17
then) 0 83 17
we’ll 0 83 17
all 0 83 17
get 0 83 17
to 0 83 17
evaluate 0 83 17
the 0 83 17
work 0 83 17
that 0 83 17
they 0 83 17
do.” 0 83 17

Pompeo 0 83 18
refused 0 83 18
to 0 83 18
discuss 0 83 18
possible 0 83 18
consequences 0 83 18
for 0 83 18
those 0 83 18
found 0 83 18
responsible 0 83 18
for 0 83 18
Khashoggi’s 0 83 18
disappearance, 0 83 18
reiterating 0 83 18
at 0 83 18
least 0 83 18
three 0 83 18
times 0 83 18
the 0 83 18
“importance 0 83 18
of 0 83 18
the 0 83 18
investigation.” 0 83 18

Later 0 83 19
Wednesday, 0 83 19
Pompeo 0 83 19
said 0 83 19
during 0 83 19
a 0 83 19
refueling 0 83 19
stopover 0 83 19
in 0 83 19
Brussels 0 83 19
that 0 83 19
Erdogan 0 83 19
had 0 83 19
informed 0 83 19
him 0 83 19
the 0 83 19
Saudis 0 83 19
were 0 83 19
cooperating 0 83 19
with 0 83 19
the 0 83 19
Turkish 0 83 19
investigation 0 83 19
“after 0 83 19
a 0 83 19
couple 0 83 19
of 0 83 19
delays.” 0 83 19

Turkish 0 83 20
officials 0 83 20
“seemed 0 83 20
pretty 0 83 20
confident 0 83 20

to 0 83 20
complete” 0 83 20
the 0 83 20
investigation, 0 83 20
Pompeo 0 83 20
told 0 83 20

Arabia 0 83 21
get 0 83 21
out 0 83 21
of 0 83 21
its 0 83 21

Pompeo 0 83 21
urged 0 83 21
Americans 0 83 21
to 0 83 21
be 0 83 21
mindful 0 83 21
of 0 83 21
the 0 83 21
extensive 0 83 21

ties 0 83 21
between 0 83 21

including 0 83 21
efforts 0 83 21
against 0 83 21
what 0 83 21
he 0 83 21
called 0 83 21

of 0 83 21

“The 0 83 22
Saudis 0 83 22

“We 0 83 23

on 0 83 23
whether 0 83 23

Congress 0 83 23
and 0 83 23
elsewhere 0 83 23

Critics 0 83 24

whether 0 83 24
the 0 83 24
Saudi 0 83 24
rulers, 0 83 24

— 0 83 24
especially 0 83 24
without 0 83 24
decisive 0 83 24

the 0 83 24

Saudi 0 83 25
leaders 0 83 25
for 0 83 25
two 0 83 25

On 0 83 26
Monday, 0 83 26
they 0 83 26
began 0 83 26
floating 0 83 26
a 0 83 26
scenario 0 83 26
— 0 83 26
initially 0 83 26
adopted 0 83 26
by 0 83 26
Trump 0 83 26
