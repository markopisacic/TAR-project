FOR 0
THE 0
FIRST 0
TIME 0
ONLINE: 0
Archbishop 0
Lefebvre’s 0
Prophetic 0
Address 0
to 0
The 0
Remnant, 0
1976 0

On 0
that 0
occasion 0
Archbishop 0
Lefebvre 0
delivered 0
an 0
address 0
on 0
the 0
desperate 1
state 1
of 0
the 0
Church 0
at 0
that 0
time—42 0
years 0
ago—that 0
was 0
never 0
transcribed 0
or 0
published 0
until 0
we 0
did 0
so 0
for 0
the 0
December 0
15, 0
2017 0
print 0
edition 0
of 0
The 0
Remnant. 0

It 0
was 0
held 0
at 0
the 0
Radisson 0
South 0
Hotel, 0
Minneapolis, 0
on 0
Tuesday, 0
May 0
12, 0
1976, 0
and 0
its 0
stated 0
purpose 0
was 0
to 0
assist 0
the 0
Archbishop 0
in 0
gaining 0
a 0
stronger 0
foothold 0
for 0
the 0
Society 0
of 0
St. 0
Pius 0
X 0
in 0
the 0
States 0
during 0
the 0
unprecedented 0
crisis 0
Blessed 0
Pope 0
Paul 0
had 0
helped 0
unleash 0
on 0
the 0
Church. 0

I’m 0
posting 0
the 0
address 0
here 0
because 0
I'm 0
convinced 0
the 0
Archbishop’s 0
words 0
provide 0
recent 0
recruits 0
to 0
Tradition 0
with 0
vital 0
historical 0
context 0
for 0
the 0
diabolical 1
debacle 1
that 0
is 0
the 0
pontificate 0
of 0
Pope 0
Francis. 0

And 0
for 0
those 0
of 0
us 0
who’ve 0
been 0
in 0
the 0
trenches 0
for 0
a 0
long, 0
long 0
time 0
it 0
also 0
provides 0
welcome 0
reminder 0
of 0
why 0
we 0
must 0
continue 0
to 0
fight. 0

Even 0
though 0
I 0
personally 0
was 0
in 0
attendance 0
back 0
in 0
1976 0
when 0
Archbishop 0
Lefebvre 0
delivered 0
this 0
address 0
in 0
Minneapolis, 0
I 0
was 0
only 0
ten 0
years 0
old 0
and 0
of 0
course 0
didn't 0
realize 0
how 0
prophetic 0
he 0
was 0
on 0
that 0
occasion, 0
or 0
how 0
devastated 0
by 0
the 0
Second 0
Vatican 0
Council, 0
the 0
New 0
Mass, 0
and 0
the 0
Freemasonic 0
infiltration 0
of 0
the 0
Vatican. 0

In 0
fact, 0
this 0
transcript 0
reads 0
like 0
a 0
message 0
of 0
encouragement 0
at 0
a 0
crucial 0
moment 0
in 0
the 0
history 0
of 0
this 0
movement—Stay 0
in 1
the 1
fight! 1

Keep 1
the 1
Faith. 1

Never 1
surrender! 1

This 0
address 0
also 0
makes 0
it 0
absolutely 0
clear 0
that 0
everything 0
Archbishop 0
Lefebvre 0
did 0
was 0
part 0
of 0
an 0
eleventh-hour 0
defence 0
of 0
the 0
Kingship 0
of 0
Christ 0
(ignored 0
completely 0
by 0
the 0
Second 0
Vatican 0
Council) 0
and 0
a 0
desperate 0
last 0
stand 0
for 0
Tradition, 0
the 1
infallible 1
teachings 1
of 1
Mother 1
Church 1
and 0
of 0
course 0
her 0
ancient 0
liturgy. 0

And 0
now 0
that 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
has 0
inadvertently 0
unmasked 0
the 0
true 0
spirit 0
of 0
Vatican 0
II, 0
it 0
becomes 0
obvious 0
how 0
and 0
why 0
those 0
who 0
resisted 0
that 0
spirit 0
were 0
right 0
to 0
have 0
done 0
so 0
and 0
will 0
certainly 0
be 0
hailed 0
by 0
history 0
as 0
the 0
heroic 0
band 0
of 0
Catholic 0
brothers 0
that 0
mounted 0
the 0
twentieth 0
century’s 0
last 0
stand 0
for 0
Christ 0
the 0
King 0
and, 0
while 0
scorned 0
and 0
mocked 0
at 0
the 0
time, 0
were 0
nevertheless 0
totally 0
vindicated 0
fifty 0
years 0
later. 0

May 0
we 0
continue 0
to 0
earn 0
the 0
right 0
to 0
stand 0
with 0
them 0
today. 0

MJM 0

The 0
Archbishop 0
Speaks 0

Ladies 0
and 0
Gentlemen: 0

As 0
I 0
said 0
to 0
Mr. 0
[Walter] 0
Matt, 0
I 0
can 0
say 0
in 0
bad 0
English 0
what 0
he 0
says 0
in 0
good 0
English, 0
because 0
he 0
said 0
all 0
of 0
the 0
things 0
I 0
want 0
to 0
say 0
[Referring 0
here 0
to 0
Walter 0
Matt’s 0
introductory 0
talk 0
referenced 0
above.] 0

And 0
I 0
thank 0
you, 0
Mr. 0
Matt, 0
very 0
much, 0
for 0
his 0
invitation, 0
and 0
I 0
thank 0
you 0
for 0
your 0
coming, 0
and 0
I 0
thank 0
Fr. 0

Ward 0
for 0
what 0
he 0
said 0
about 0
the 0
Society 0
of 0
St. 0
Pius 0
X. 0

And 0
I 0
hope 0
that 0
you 0
can 0
understand 0
my 0
poor 0
English, 0
but 0
I 0
think 0
it 0
is 0
better 0
to 0
speak 0
some 0
bad 0
English 0
because 0
to 0
translate 0
would 0
take 0
too 0
much 0
time. 0

As 0
Mr. 0
Matt 0
said, 0
the 0
crisis 0
in 0
the 0
Church 0
is 0
very 0
extraordinary. 0

It 0
is 0
very 0
difficult 0
to 0
understand 0
the 0
situation 0
today. 0

My 0
seminary 0
in 0
Econe 0
(in 0
Switzerland) 0
and 0
the 0
seminaries 0
in 0
Germany 0
and 0
here 0
in 0
America, 0
in 0
Armada, 0
are 0
in 0
very 0
difficult 0
situations 0
with 0
Rome. 0

Why? 0

These 0
seminaries 0
are 0
the 0
same 0
as 0
seminaries 0
were 0
before 0
the 0
Second 0
Vatican 0
Council. 0

They 0
have 0
the 0
same 0
discipline 0
and 0
the 0
same 0
studies, 0
they 0
make 0
good 0
priests; 0
I 0
think 0
they 0
are 0
good 0
seminarians. 0

All 0
is 0
done 0
as 0
all 0
the 0
seminaries 0
before 0
the 0
Second 0
Vatican 0
Council. 0

Why 0
are 0
we 0
now 0
in 0
this 0
very 0
sad 0
situation 0
with 0
Rome? 0

I 0
think 0
that 0
because 0
in 0
the 0
Second 0
Vatican 0
Council, 0
and 0
after 0
the 0
Council, 0
there 0
is 0
a 1
mutation, 1
a 1
change, 1
in 1
the 1
Church. 1

But 0
we 0
do 0
not 0
change. 0

We 0
continue 0
the 0
Tradition. 0

So 0
why 0
do 0
they 0
now 0
say, 0
as 0
Mgr. 0

(Archbishop) 0
Benelli[1] 0
said 0
to 0
me 0
months 0
ago 0
on 0
the 0
19th 0
of 0
March, 0
“you 0
are 0
out 0
of 0
communion 0
with 0
the 0
Church.” 0
I 0
am 0
out 0
of 0
communion 0
with 0
the 0
Church 0
because 0
I 0
continue 0
the 0
Tradition 0
of 0
the 0
Church? 0

This 0
is 0
possible? 0

I 0
do 0
not 0
understand. 0

Why? 0

I 0
have 0
done 0
nothing. 0

I 0
believe 0
nothing 0
other 0
than 0
what 0
the 0
Church 0
has 0
believed 0
for 0
twenty 0
centuries. 0

Mgr. 0

Benelli 0
then 0
said 0
to 0
me, 0
you 0
must 0
put 0
down 0
in 0
a 0
writing 0
to 0
the 0
Holy 0
Father 0
that 0
you 0
accept 0
the 0
Second 0
Vatican 0
Council, 0
you 0
accept 0
the 0
reform 0
that 0
followed 0
the 0
Council, 0
and 0
that 0
you 0
accept 0
the 0
orientations 0
that 0
have 0
been 0
given 0
by 0
Rome. 0

Mgr. 0

Benelli 0
took 0
the 0
book 0
of 0
the 0
New 0
Ordo, 0
gave 0
it 0
to 0
me, 0
and 0
said, 0
“You 0
must 0
say 0
this 0
New 0
Mass 0
in 0
all 0
of 0
your 0
houses.” 0

I 0
wonder 0
why 0
Mgr. 0

Benelli 0
did 0
not 0
communicate 0
this 0
condition 0
to 0
me 0
before 0
our 0
meeting. 0

[2] 0
He 0
could 0
have 0
done 0
so. 0

For 0
example, 0
one 0
year 0
ago 0
three 0
cardinals 0
sent 0
me 0
a 0
letter 0
(Cardinals 0
Wright, 0
Tabera 0
[Arturo 0
Carinal 0
Tabera 0
Araoz, 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
Council 0
Fathers 0
MJM], 0
and 0
Gabriel-Marie 0
Garrone) 0
telling 0
me 0
(in 0
effect) 0
that 0
I 0
must 0
close 0
the 0
seminaries. 0

Well, 0
I 0
refused, 0
because 0
I 1
refuse 1
to 1
contribute 1
to 1
the 1
destruction 1
of 1
the 1
Church. 1

Because 0
now 0
they 0
are 0
destroying 1
the 1
Church. 1

When 0
I 0
die 0
and 0
go 0
before 0
the 0
judge, 0
God 0
will 0
not 0
be 0
able 0
to 0
say 0
to 0
me, 0
“You 1
destroyed 1
the 1
Church.” 1
I 0
refused 0
to 0
contribute 0
to 0
the 0
destruction 1
of 1
the 1
Church. 1

I 0
am 0
sure 0
that 0
my 0
seminaries 0
are 0
contributing 0
to 0
the 0
restoration 0
of 0
the 0
Church. 0

I 0
do 0
not 0
destroy 0
the 0
Church. 0

And 0
so 0
I 0
said 0
to 0
Mgr. 0

Benelli, 0
“No, 0
I 0
will 0
not 0
sign 0
that 0
writing.” 0

I 0
think 0
that 0
the 1
mutation 1
in 1
the 1
Church 1
came 0
in 0
through 0
the 0
Second 0
Vatican 0
Council. 0

And 0
do 0
you 0
think 0
this 0
change 0
in 0
the 0
Church 0
came 0
suddenly? 0

When, 0
then? 0

At 0
the 0
beginning 0
of 0
the 0
Council? 0

No, 0
this 0
change 0
in 0
the 0
Church 0
began 0
one 0
century 0
before 0
[the 0
Council]. 0

Pope 0
Pius 0
VI 0
said 0
during 0
the 0
French 0
Revolution 0
that 0
if 1
the 1
Church 1
continues 1
to 1
remain 1
under 1
the 1
influence 1
of 1
the 1
prince 1
of 1
the 1
revolution, 1
then, 1
in 1
the 1
future 1
a 1
crisis 1
will 1
come 1
upon 1
the 1
Church. 1

In 0
[1844], 0
Pope 0
Pius 0
IX 0
ordered 0
Cardinal 0
Rigoli 0
to 0
publish 0
the 0
Instructions 0
of 0
the 0
Carbonari. 0

[3] 0
The 0
Pope 0
himself 0
asked 0
Cardinal 0
Rigoli 0
to 0
publish 0
the 0
Instructions 0
of 0
the 0
Carbonari. 0

And 0
what 0
did 0
these 0
Instructions 0
say? 0

The 0
Instructions 0
said 0
that 0
they 0
[the 0
Carbonari/Freemasons] 0
must 0
begin 0
to 0
fight 0
against 0
the 0
Church 0
by 0
bringing 0
reform 0
into 0
the 0
Church. 0

The 0
Instructions 0
said 0
the 0
infiltration 0
will 0
take 0
perhaps 0
not 0
one 0
year, 0
perhaps 0
not 0
ten 0
years, 0
but 0
perhaps 0
a 0
century. 0

The 0
Carbonari 0
must 0
enter 0
into 0
the 0
seminary, 0
into 0
the 0
convent, 0
into 0
the 0
sacristy, 0
and 0
slowly, 0
very 0
slowly, 0
the 0
priests 0
will 0
have 0
the 0
ideals 0
of 0
the 0
revolution; 0
of 0
the 0
Freemasons. 0

One 0
day 0
these 0
priests, 0
imbued 0
with 0
Masonic 0
principles, 0
will 0
become 0
bishops, 0
and 0
these 0
bishops 0
can 0
then 0
choose 0
a 0
pope. 0

And 0
even 0
if 0
the 0
pope 0
is 0
not 0
a 0
Freemason, 0
he 0
will 0
have 0
the 0
same 0
ideals 0
as 0
the 0
Freemasons. 0

Pope 0
Pius 0
IX 0
called 0
for 0
the 0
publishing 0
of 0
these 0
Instructions 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
warn 0
the 0
bishops 0
and 0
priests 0
of 0
those 0
times 0
of 0
the 0
fight 0
against 0
the 0
church. 0

In 0
1895, 0
the 0
Catholic 0
Antonia 0
Fogazzaro, 0
a 0
known 0
modernist, 0
founded 0
a 0
masonic 0
lodge 0
in 0
Milan. 0

He 0
wrote 0
in 0
his 0
book, 0
Il 0
Santo, 0
that 0
“We 0
[modernists]…want 0
a 0
reform 0
in 0
the 0
Church…without 0
rebellion, 0
carried 0
out 0
by 0
legitimate 0
authority…even 0
if 0
this 0
takes 0
20, 0
30, 0
or 0
50 0
years.”[4] 0
“The 0
reform 0
will 0
have 0
to 0
be 0
brought 0
about 0
in 0
the 0
name 0
of 0
obedience.” 0
The 0
modernist 0
ideas 0
in 0
the 0
Church 0
introduced 0
and 0
enacted 0
through 0
obedience! 0

And 0
I 0
think…well, 0
here 0
we 0
are! 0

In 0
this 0
time! 0

The 0
reform 0
is 0
here, 0
and 0
it 0
is 0
brought 0
about 0
through 0
obedience, 0
to 0
the 0
Council, 0
to 0
the 0
bishop, 0
to 0
the 0
priest. 0

And 0
all 0
they 0
say 0
is 0
“Obedience, 0
obedience, 0
obedience.” 0

The 0
Instructions 0
of 0
the 0
Carbonari 0
say 0
the 0
bishop 0
and 0
the 0
priest 0
will 0
think 0
that 0
they 0
are 0
following 0
the 0
tiara 0
of 0
the 0
Pope, 0
but 0
they 0
will 0
be 0
following 0
the 0
flag 0
of 0
Freemasonry 0
[“the 0
banner 0
of 0
revolution”]. 0

They 1
said 1
that. 1

They 1
wrote 1
that! 1

One 0
century 0
before 0
[the 0
Council]! 0

Thus, 0
it 0
is 0
very 0
important 0
to 0
know 0
that 0
they 0
prepared 0
for 0
the 0
beginning 0
of 0
the 0
Second 0
Vatican 0
Council 0
for 0
a 0
century, 0
perhaps 0
two 0
centuries! 0

As 0
the 0
Archbishop 0
of 0
Dakar 0
and 0
President 0
of 0
the 0
Episcopal 0
Commission 0
for 0
French-speaking 0
West 0
Africa, 0
I 0
was 0
appointed 0
member 0
of 0
the 0
Central 0
Preparatory 0
Commission 0
of 0
the 0
Second 0
Vatican 0
Council. 0

There 0
were 0
some 0
seventy 0
cardinals, 0
twenty 0
bishops, 0
and 0
four 0
super-authorities 0
of 0
the 0
religious 0
orders, 0
among 0
others. 0

Before 0
the 0
last 0
meeting 0
of 0
this 0
Commission 0
the 0
members 0
received 0
two 0
schemas 0
on 0
the 0
same 0
subject: 0
one 0
from 0
Cardinal 0
Ottaviani 0
and 0
another 0
from 0
Cardinal 0
Bea. 0

The 0
schema 0
from 0
Cardinal 0
Ottaviani 0
was 0
titled 0
“…On 0
Religious 0
Tolerance” 0
and 0
the 0
other, 0
from 0
Cardinal 0
Bea, 0
was 0
titled 0
“On 0
Religious 0
Freedom 0
[Liberty].” 0
When 0
we 0
read 0
these 0
two 0
schemas, 0
we 0
thought, 0
“This 0
is 0
impossible. 0

How 0
is 0
it 0
we 0
can 0
receive 0
two 0
opposing 0
theses? 0

One 0
says 0
we 0
must 0
not 0
tolerate 0
error. 0

The 0
other 0
says 0
that 0
error 0
has 0
the 0
right 0
to 0
exist 0
in 0
the 0
name 0
of 0
the 0
dignity 0
of 0
the 0
human 0
person.” 0
And 0
so, 0
we 0
go 0
into 0
the 0
meeting. 0

Cardinal 0
Ottaviani, 0
standing, 0
says 0
to 0
Cardinal 0
Bea, 0
“You 1
have 1
no 1
authority 1
to 1
compose 1
this 1
schema, 1
because 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
theological 1
thesis 1
and 1
therefore 1
within 1
the 1
competence 1
of 1
the 1
Theological 1
Commission.” 1
As 0
Cardinal 0
Bea 0
stands 0
up, 0
he 0
says, 0
“I 0
do 1
have 1
the 1
right 1
to 1
compose 1
this 1
schema 1
because 1
if 1
anything 1
concerns 1
Christian 1
Unity 1
it 1
is 1
religious 1
liberty, 1
and 1
I 1
am 1
the 1
President 1
of 1
the 1
Secretariat 1
for 1
Promoting 1
Christian 1
Unity.” 1
Cardinal 0
Bea, 0
addressing 0
Cardinal 0
Ottaviani, 0
further 0
said, 0
“I 0
am 0
opposed 0
to 0
your 0
schema.” 0

Impossible! 1

We 1
were 1
in 1
a 1
very 1
sad, 1
serious 1
situation. 1

Cardinal 0
Ruffini 0
had 0
to 0
intervene 0
as 0
we 0
were 0
in 0
front 0
of 0
two 0
cardinals, 0
our 0
brothers. 0

He 0
said 0
we 0
must 0
wait 0
for 0
the 0
authority 0
to 0
say 0
who 0
is 0
right 0
and 0
who 0
is 0
wrong. 0

But 0
before 0
the 0
Pope 0
came 0
(because 0
the 0
Pope 0
came 0
many 0
times 0
to 0
present 0
at 0
these 0
meetings) 0
we 0
voted 0
on 0
the 0
schema. 0

Who 0
is 0
with 0
Cardinal 0
Ottaviani? 0

Who 0
is 0
with 0
Cardinal 0
Bea? 0

The 0
conservatives 0
and 0
the 0
liberals. 0

As 0
the 0
last 0
meeting 0
of 0
the 0
Preparatory 0
Commission, 0
it 0
was 0
for 0
me 0
the 0
first 0
image 0
of 0
the 0
future 0
Council. 0

This 0
historic 0
address 0
appeared 0
for 0
the 0
first 0
time 0
ever 0
in 0
a 0
print 0
edition 0
of 0
The 0
Remnant 0
last 0
year. 0

Isn't 0
it 0
time 0
for 0
you 0
to 0
subscribe? 0

And 0
as 0
we 0
go 0
into 0
the 0
Council, 0
you 0
know 0
that 0
on 0
the 0
first 0
day 0
of 0
the 0
Council, 0
Cardinal 0
Lienart 0
was 0
the 0
chief 0
of 0
the 0
liberal 0
cardinals 0
in 0
the 0
Council, 0
[together] 0
with 0
all 0
of 0
the 0
Cardinals 0
of 0
the 0
Rhine 0
(such 0
as 0
Cardinal 0
Alfrink, 0
Cardinal 0
Frings, 0
Cardinal 0
Dopfner, 0
Cardinal 0
Suenens, 0
Cardinal 0
Leinart, 0
and 0
Cardinal 0
Koenig 0
of 0
Austria). 0

And 0
now 0
one 0
month 0
ago 0
in 0
Rome, 0
the 0
traditional 0
periodical 0
Chiesa 0
Viva 0
published 0
a 0
photo 0
of 0
Cardinal 0
Lienart 0
with 0
all 0
of 0
the 0
appurtenances 0
of 0
Freemasonry, 1
the 0
date 0
of 0
his 0
inscription 0
in 0
Masonry, 0
the 0
date 0
[of 0
his 0
rising 0
to] 0
the 0
20th 0
Degree 0
of 0
Freemasonry, 1
the 0
date 0
[of 0
his 0
rising 0
to] 0
the 0
30th 0
Degree 0
of 0
Freemasonry, 1
and 0
the 0
places 0
where 0
he 0
[attended] 0
the 0
meetings 0
of 0
Freemasonry. 1

This 0
Cardinal 0
was 0
the 0
chief 0
of 0
the 0
liberals 0
in 0
the 0
Council. 0

That 0
is 0
my 0
cardinal; 0
he 0
ordained 0
me 0
to 0
the 0
priesthood, 0
and 0
he 0
consecrated 0
me 0
a 0
bishop. 0

And 0
now 0
this 0
is 0
public. 0

Nobody 0
has 0
been 0
able 0
to 0
refute 0
the 0
publication. 0

And 0
so, 0
we 0
have 0
(I 0
am 0
confident) 0
a 1
mutation 1
in 1
the 1
church 1
by 0
the 0
Council 0
and 0
by 0
the 0
reform 0
after 0
the 0
Council. 0

Now, 0
some 0
say 0
the 0
Council 0
is 0
(was) 0
good, 0
but 0
only 0
the 0
reforms 0
were 0
bad. 0

That 0
is 0
not 0
true. 0

Why? 0

Because 0
when 0
the 0
reforms 0
come, 0
Rome 0
always 0
says 0
the 0
reforms 0
are 0
being 0
done 0
in 0
the 0
name 0
of 0
the 0
Council. 0

In 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
the 1
Council! 1

It 0
is 0
evident 0
that 0
all 0
of 0
the 0
reforms 0
came 0
from 0
the 0
Council. 0

And 0
if 1
the 1
reforms 1
are 1
bad, 1
then 1
it 1
is 1
impossible 1
that 1
the 1
Council 1
is 1
good 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
reforms 1
are 1
bad, 1
because 1
that 1
is 1
the 1
authentic 1
interpretation 1
of 1
the 1
Council 1
by 1
Rome. 1

Rome 0
said 0
in 0
the 0
name 0
of 0
the 0
Declaration 0
of 0
Liturgy, 0
we 0
[implement] 0
the 0
liturgical 0
reform. 0

We 0
can 0
say 0
that 0
[these 0
bad 0
changes 0
are] 0
not 0
in 0
the 0
text 0
of 0
the 0
Declaration, 0
but 0
this 0
man 0
has 0
the 0
authority 0
to 0
say 0
that 0
this 0
is 0
from 0
the 0
Council. 0

They 0
know 0
that. 0

And 0
I 0
am 0
sure 0
that 0
it 0
[the 0
mutation] 0
is 0
in 0
the 0
Council. 0

Even 0
if 0
it 0
is 0
not 0
explicitly 0
[stated] 0
in 0
the 0
Council 0
but 0
[rather] 0
in 0
the 0
spirit 0
of 0
the 0
Council, 0
it 0
is 0
the 0
same! 0

For 0
example, 0
with 0
religious 0
freedom: 0
now 0
the 0
Holy 0
See 0
and 0
all 0
the 0
Nuncios 0
are 0
against 0
the 0
Catholic 0
State 0
in 0
the 0
name 0
of 0
the 0
Council 0
- 0
in 0
the 0
name 0
of 0
the 0
Declaration 0
of 0
Religious 0
Freedom. 0

I 0
have 0
heard 0
this 0
(personally) 0
twice. 0

The 0
first 0
time 0
I 0
was 0
in 0
Columbia. 0

When 0
I 0
was 0
in 0
Columbia, 0
I 0
read 0
in 0
the 0
paper 0
about 0
the 0
change 0
in 0
the 0
first 0
article 0
of 0
the 0
Constitution 0
of 0
the 0
Republic 0
of 0
Columbia. 0

[The 0
first 0
article] 0
stated 0
that 0
only 0
the 0
Republic 0
of 0
Columbia 0
recognizes 0
only 0
the 0
Catholic 0
religion. 0

They 0
changed 0
it. 0

They 0
removed 0
this 0
article. 0

I 0
read 0
the 0
discourse 0
of 0
the 0
President 0
of 0
Columbia 0
with 0
the 0
Nuncios 0
of 0
Columbia 0
and 0
the 0
Secretary 0
of 0
the 0
Episcopal 0
Conference 0
in 0
Columbia. 0

The 0
President 0
said 0
he 0
is 0
very, 1
very 1
anxious. 1

He 0
said 0
to 0
the 0
people, 0
“even 0
though 0
we 0
remove 0
this 0
article 0
we 0
remain 0
Catholic. 0

I 0
am 0
a 0
Catholic, 0
I 0
shall 0
remain 0
Catholic, 0
and 0
I 1
do 1
everything 1
possible 1
for 1
the 1
Council 1
and 1
the 1
Catholics 1
in 1
our 1
country.” 1

Then, 0
the 0
discourse 0
of 0
the 0
Nuncio 0
was 0
the 0
discourse 0
of 0
a 0
Freemason: 0
all 0
of 0
it 0
was 0
“progress,” 0
“humanity,” 0
“evolution,” 0
and 0
all 0
the 0
hubris 0
of 0
a 0
Freemason. 0

And 0
during 0
the 0
discourse 0
of 0
the 0
Secretary 0
of 0
the 0
Episcopal 0
Conference, 0
[the 0
Secretary] 0
said, 0
“in 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
the 1
Declaration 1
of 1
Religious 1
Freedom 1
[of 1
Vatican 1
II], 1
we 1
ask 1
the 1
President 1
to 1
remove 1
this 1
article 1
in 1
the 1
Constitution.” 1

I 0
met 0
this 0
Secretary 0
of 0
the 0
Episcopal 0
Conference 0
during 0
my 0
visit 0
in 0
Columbia, 0
and 0
he 0
said 0
for 0
two 0
years 0
they 0
[had 0
been 0
asking] 0
the 0
President, 0
in 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
the 1
Holy 1
See, 1
to 0
change 0
this 0
article 0
in 0
their 0
Constitution. 0

But 0
I 0
will 0
never…I 0
do 0
not 0
accept 0
the 0
concept, 0
because 0
you 0
destroy 0
the 0
Catholic 0
State 0
in 0
the 0
name 0
of 0
the 0
Council. 0

Are 0
you 0
sure? 0

Yes, 0
sure. 0

It 0
is 0
evident. 0

Now 0
I 0
said 0
to 0
the 0
[Secretary], 0
“As 0
I 0
speak 0
with 0
you 0
now 0
about 0
Columbia, 0
I 0
know 0
that 0
you 0
are 0
the 0
one 0
responsible 0
for 0
the 0
change 0
in 0
the 0
constitution 0
of 0
Valais 0
in 0
Switzerland 0
one 0
year 0
ago. 0

The 0
change 0
in 0
the 0
Constitution 0
of 0
Valais 0
was 0
the 0
same.” 0
(Because 0
you 0
know 0
Switzerland 0
is 0
a 0
Federation 0
where 0
some 0
states 0
are 0
Protestant 0
and 0
some 0
states 0
are 0
Catholic. 0

The 0
Valais 0
is 0
Catholic. 0

And 0
in 0
its 0
constitution, 0
the 0
words 0
of 0
the 0
first 0
article 0
[of 0
the 0
constitution] 0
of 0
the 0
State 0
of 0
Valais 0
– 0
Econe, 0
where 0
we 0
are 0
located, 0
is 0
in 0
the 0
State 0
of 0
Valais 0
- 0
only 0
one 0
religion 0
is 0
recognized: 0
The 0
Catholic 0
Church.) 0

And 0
[the 0
Secretary] 0
said, 0
“Yes, 0
I 0
am 0
responsible 0
for 0
this 0
change.” 0
Brother, 0
what 0
did 0
you 0
do 0
with 0
the 0
Social 0
Kingship 0
of 0
Christ? 0

What 0
is 0
this 0
for 0
you? 0

What 0
do 0
you 0
say 0
when 0
you 0
say 0
“thy 0
kingdom 0
come” 0
in 0
your 0
prayer, 0
the 0
Our 0
Father? 0

“Ah,” 0
the 0
Nuncio 0
said 0
to 0
me, 0
“Now 0
it 0
is 0
impossible.” 0
What 0
did 0
you 0
do 0
with 0
the 0
encyclical 0
of 0
Pope 0
Pius 0
XI, 0
Quas 0
Primas? 0

“Ah, 0
but 0
now 0
the 0
Pope 0
cannot 0
write 0
an 0
encyclical 0
like 0
Quas 0
Primas.” 0

It 0
is 0
incredible. 0

And 0
all 0
in 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
the 1
Council. 1

We 1
must 1
take 1
care, 1
because 1
this 1
change 1
in 1
the 1
church 1
is 1
a 1
liberal 1
change. 1

The 1
liberal 1
principles 1
have 1
entered 1
the 1
Church 1
now, 1
and 1
they 1
destroy 1
the 1
Church. 1

If 0
we 0
cannot 0
set 0
out 0
the 0
true 0
principles 0
of 0
the 0
Church, 0
if 0
we 0
in 0
the 0
name 0
of 0
religious 0
freedom 0
said 0
that 0
all 0
religions 0
have 0
the 0
same 0
right 0
in 0
every 0
state 0
in 0
the 0
world… 0

[missing 0
audio...] 0

The 0
truth 0
is 0
the 0
only 0
one 0
King 0
of 0
the 0
World 0
is 0
Jesus 0
Christ. 0

We 0
say 0
in 0
the 0
Gloria 0
in 0
Excelsis 0
Deo, 0
“Tu 0
solus 0
Altissimus,” 0
“Tu 0
solus 0
Dominus,” 0
“You 0
alone 0
are 0
the 0
Highest,” 0
“You 0
alone 0
are 0
the 0
Lord.” 0
But 0
practically, 0
we 0
would 0
refuse 0
this 0
Kingdom 0
of 0
Jesus 0
Christ 0
if 0
we 0
said 0
that 0
Luther, 0
Mohammed, 0
Buddha 0
and 0
Jesus 0
Christ 0
are 0
all 0
the 0
same. 0

We 0
cannot 0
say 0
that. 0

Impossible. 1

We 0
know 0
that 0
in 0
many 0
states 0
(it 0
is 0
a 0
pity) 0
it 0
is 0
impossible 0
[to 0
recognize 0
Catholicism 0
as 0
the 0
state 0
religion]. 0

We 1
must 1
tolerate 1
- 1
have 1
tolerance 1
for 1
the 1
error 1
- 1
but 1
never 1
give 1
the 1
same 1
right 1
to 1
error 1
and 1
truth. 1

That 1
is 1
impossible. 1

And 0
the 0
change 0
in 0
the 0
liturgy 0
is 0
very 0
important. 0

It 0
is 0
very 0
bad. 0

One 0
of 0
the 0
principles 0
of 0
modern 0
man, 0
as 0
they 0
say 0
now, 0
“modern 0
man,” 0
is 0
democracy. 0

And 0
democracy 0
can 0
have 0
a 0
good 0
sense 0
but 0
not 0
if 0
[by 0
that 0
term 0
is 0
meant] 0
that 0
those 0
who 0
govern 0
receive 0
their 0
authority 0
from 0
the 0
people. 0

The 1
authority 1
comes 1
from 1
God. 1

Not 1
from 1
the 1
people. 1

Not 1
from 1
the 1
masses. 1

From 1
God. 1

But 0
today 0
the 0
principle, 0
the 0
democratic 1
principle, 1
is 0
that 0
the 0
authority 0
is 0
in 0
the 0
people. 0

It 0
is 0
in 1
the 1
masses. 1

That 0
is 0
not 0
true. 0

It 0
is 0
impossible. 0

And 0
our 0
liturgy 0
is 0
the 0
school 0
of 0
our 0
Faith. 0

It 0
is 0
the 0
first 0
school 0
of 0
our 0
Faith 0
for 0
all 0
people. 0

I 0
was 0
in 0
Africa 0
as 0
a 0
missionary 0
and 0
as 0
bishop 0
for 0
30 0
years. 0

I 0
know 0
the 0
liturgy 0
was 0
the 0
best 0
school 0
of 0
the 0
Faith 0
for 0
people 0
who 0
cannot 0
read. 0

They 0
can 0
see 0
what 0
the 0
priest 0
does. 0

They 0
can 0
see 0
what 0
the 0
priest 0
does 0
at 0
the 0
adoration 0
of 0
the 0
Body 0
and 0
the 0
Blood 0
of 0
Jesus 0
Christ. 0

And 0
they 0
know 0
that 0
Jesus 0
Christ 0
is 0
present 0
- 0
His 0
real 0
presence 0
is 0
on 0
the 0
altar 0
- 0
by 0
the 0
attitude 0
of 0
the 0
priest. 0

They 0
know 0
that. 0

That 0
is 0
very 0
important. 0

But 0
the 0
change 0
in 0
the 0
Mass 0
destroys 1
the 1
Church. 1

Because 0
we 0
know 0
the 0
liturgy 0
teaches 0
us 0
hierarchy. 0

The 0
true 0
liturgy 0
is 0
hierarchical. 0

It 0
is 0
not 0
democratic 0
but 0
hierarchical. 1

Why? 0

Because 0
we 0
have 0
God, 0
the 0
priest, 0
and 0
then 0
the 0
people. 0

That 0
is 0
hierarchy. 0

When 0
we 0
are 0
in 0
Church 0
we 0
know 0
God 0
is 0
on 0
the 0
altar; 0
the 0
priest 0
is 0
between 0
God 0
and 0
the 0
people; 0
and 0
the 0
people 0
receive 0
God 0
at 0
the 0
hand 0
of 0
the 0
priest. 0

That 1
is 1
hierarchy. 1

But 0
now 0
the 0
new 0
liturgy 0
is 0
more 0
democratic 0
- 0
all 0
around 0
the 0
table. 0

The 0
priest 0
is 0
only 0
the 0
president, 0
and 0
sometimes 0
another 0
man 0
can 0
take 0
the 0
role 0
of 0
the 0
president 0
of 0
the 0
meal. 0

That 0
is 0
a 0
new 0
liturgy. 0

That 0
is 0
very 0
bad, 0
because 0
we 0
have 0
no 0
sense 0
of 0
the 0
hierarchical; 0
whereas 0
the 0
sense 0
of 0
hierarchy 0
is 0
very 0
important 0
in 0
our 0
life. 0

We 0
need 0
the 0
authority 0
of 0
God. 0

We 0
need 0
the 0
Real 0
Presence 0
of 0
God 0
on 0
our 0
altar. 0

We 0
need 0
the 0
Sacrifice 0
of 0
the 0
Mass 0
– 0
not 0
a 0
meal 0
only 0
– 0
but 0
the 0
Sacrifice. 0

So, 0
the 0
Victim 0
of 0
the 0
Sacrifice 0
is 0
really 0
present 0
on 0
our 0
altar. 0

That 0
is 0
the 0
school 0
of 0
our 0
Faith. 0

And 0
slowly, 0
slowly, 0
this 0
new 0
Mass 0
equivocates. 0

It 0
moves 0
the 0
minds 0
of 0
the 0
faithful 0
in 0
a 0
Protestant 0
[direction]. 0

I 0
do 0
not 0
say 0
that 0
all 0
[Novus 0
Ordo] 0
Masses 0
are 0
invalid. 0

I 1
do 1
not 1
say 1
that. 1

But 0
perhaps, 0
more 0
and 0
more, 0
they 0
become 0
invalid 0
because 0
[the 0
ministers 0
lose 0
faith 0
in 0
the 0
Real 0
Presence]. 0

Recently, 0
in 0
France, 0
a 0
progressive 0
paper 0
conducted 0
a 0
statistical 0
survey 0
to 0
see 0
how 0
many 0
priests 0
no 0
longer 0
have 0
faith 0
in 0
the 0
Real 0
Presence. 0

They 0
found 0
that 0
twenty-two 0
percent 0
no 0
longer 0
have 0
the 0
faith, 0
the 1
belief 1
in 0
the 0
Real 0
Presence. 0

But 0
I 0
think 0
that 0
if 0
they 0
directed 0
this 0
question 0
to 0
all 0
of 0
the 0
priests 0
who 0
are 0
under 0
50 0
years 0
of 0
age, 0
they 0
would 0
find 0
that 0
fifty 0
percent 0
[have 0
lost 0
the 0
faith 0
in 0
the 0
Real 0
Presence], 0
because 0
the 0
young 0
priests 0
have 0
no 0
faith. 0

No 1
faith. 1

Last 0
year, 0
Bishop 0
Adam 0
(in 0
our 0
Diocese 0
of 0
Sion, 0
Switzerland) 0
ordained 0
one 0
priest 0
for 0
my 0
Congregation 0
of 0
the 0
Holy 0
Ghost 0
Fathers. 0

This 0
one 0
priest 0
came 0
from 0
France. 0

His 0
uncle 0
had 0
died 0
in 0
a 0
road 0
accident 0
when 0
his 0
cab 0
fell 0
in 0
the 0
river. 0

The 0
uncle 0
had 0
nine 0
children. 0

The 0
Bishop 0
said 0
to 0
the 0
new 0
priest, 0
“Now 0
you 0
can 0
say 0
Mass 0
for 0
your 0
uncle. 0

Now 0
you 0
are 0
a 0
priest, 0
and 0
you 0
can 0
say 0
Mass 0
for 0
your 0
uncle.” 0
The 0
new 0
priest 0
said, 0
“No, 0
never.” 0
Why? 0

It 0
is 0
not 0
useful 0
to 0
say 0
Mass 0
for 0
the 0
dead? 0

“No, 0
no, 0
it 0
is 0
impossible. 0

They 0
are 0
already 0
in 0
heaven.” 0
This 0
young 0
priest 0
who 0
was 0
ordained 0
by 0
the 0
Bishop 0
last 0
year 0
for 0
my 0
Congregation 0
is 0
now 0
a 0
professor 0
in 0
the 0
minor 0
seminary 0
in 0
Switzerland. 0

They 0
are 0
not 0
learning 0
theology, 0
not 0
philosophy, 0
not 0
anything. 0

They 1
learn 1
nothing 1
now. 1

Another 0
example. 0

Recently, 0
I 0
had 0
two 0
young 0
[potential] 0
seminarians 0
come 0
to 0
my 0
house 0
near 0
Paris. 0

One 0
of 0
them 0
works 0
in 0
a 0
factory, 0
and 0
the 0
other 0
is 0
a 0
university 0
student. 0

They 0
told 0
me 0
they 0
were 0
[considering] 0
the 0
seminary 0
of 0
Paris. 0

I 0
asked 0
them, 0
“Why 0
do 0
you 0
come 0
to 0
see 0
me?” 0
They 0
told 0
me 0
that 0
they 0
had 0
a 0
meeting 0
in 0
the 0
house 0
of 0
the 0
Oblate 0
of 0
Maria 0
with 0
the 0
priest 0
who 0
oversees 0
young 0
men 0
who 0
may 0
have 0
vocations 0
to 0
the 0
priesthood 0
in 0
the 0
Diocese 0
of 0
Paris. 0

There 0
was 0
a 0
total 0
of 0
fifteen 0
young 0
men 0
for 0
all 0
of 0
the 0
Diocese 0
of 0
Paris. 0

During 0
the 0
meeting, 0
the 0
priest, 0
before 0
he 0
celebrated 0
the 0
Eucharist, 0
said, 0
“Today 0
we 0
celebrate 0
the 0
Eucharist, 0
but 0
we 0
do 0
not 0
believe 0
in 0
the 0
Real 0
Presence.” 0
These 0
two 0
young 0
men 0
said 0
“That 0
is 0
impossible. 1

We 0
cannot 0
remain 0
in 0
this 0
seminary.” 0
So, 0
they 0
came 0
to 0
meet 0
me. 0

They 0
said 0
that 0
Econe 0
is 0
the 0
only 0
seminary 0
where 0
they 0
seem 0
to 0
be 0
able 0
to 0
find 0
the 0
True 0
Faith. 0

They 0
asked 0
for 0
admittance 0
to 0
Econe. 0

And 0
I 0
think 0
that 0
they 0
shall 0
be 0
coming 0
to 0
Econe 0
next 0
October. 0

But 0
that 0
is 0
a 0
new 0
religion. 0

It 0
is 0
a 0
Protestant 0
religion. 0

That 1
is 1
a 1
fact. 1

Perhaps 0
you 0
can 0
say, 0
“How 1
is 1
it 1
possible 1
that 1
the 1
pope 1
gives 1
the 1
authorization 1
to 1
this 1
change? 1

How 1
is 1
it 1
possible 1
the 1
pope 1
signed 1
this 1
decree? 1

Signed 1
this 1
constitution?” 1
I 0
don’t 0
know. 0

I 1
don’t 1
know. 1

It 0
is 0
a 0
big 0
mystery. 0

A 1
big 1
mystery. 1

There 0
are 0
many 0
proposed 0
theological 0
answers. 0

I 0
cannot 0
subscribe 0
to 0
all 0
of 0
them. 0

Some 0
say 0
the 0
pope 0
is 0
not 0
responsible. 0

Perhaps 0
someone 0
gave 0
the 0
pope 0
an 0
injection, 0
a 0
drug, 0
and 0
he 0
is 0
not 0
responsible. 0

Perhaps, 0
I 0
don’t 0
know. 0

Some 0
say 0
there 0
are 0
two 0
popes 0
[(a 0
body 0
double)]. 0

I 1
don’t 1
know. 1

Some 0
say 0
the 0
pope 0
was 0
liberal 0
before 0
he 0
was 0
elected 0
pope, 0
and 0
perhaps 0
(we 0
do 0
not 0
know) 0
he 0
gave 0
his 0
name 0
to 0
Freemasonry 0
(thereby 0
incurring 0
excommunication 0
before 0
the 0
conclave). 0

We 0
do 0
not 0
know. 0

We 0
do 0
know 0
now 0
that 0
Bugnini 0
was 0
primarily 0
responsible 0
for 0
the 0
change 0
in 0
liturgy, 0
and 0
that 0
he 1
is 1
an 1
infamous 1
Freemason. 1

And 0
because 0
he 0
had 0
an 0
indiscretion 0
with 0
his 0
Masonic 0
appurtenances, 0
the 0
Pope 0
sent 0
him 0
as 0
a 0
Nuncio 0
in 0
Iran. 0

I 1
don’t 1
know. 1

We 1
don’t 1
know. 1

Now, 0
you 0
cannot 0
say 0
that 0
Archbishop 0
Lefebvre 0
said 0
the 0
pope 0
gave 0
his 0
name 0
to 0
Freemasonry. 0

No, 0
you 0
cannot 0
say 0
that. 0

It 0
is 0
possible, 0
but 0
we 1
do 1
not 1
know. 1

But 0
if 0
he 0
was 0
excommunicated, 0
then 0
he 0
is 0
not 0
pope. 0

Not 1
pope. 1

Illegitimate. 0

I 0
don’t 0
know. 0

It 0
is 0
a 0
mystery 0
I 0
cannot 0
understand. 0

But 0
the 0
fact 0
is 0
that 0
the 0
Catholic 0
Church 0
is 0
being 0
destroyed, 0
and 0
now 0
even 0
the 0
pope 0
himself 0
says 0
that. 0

This 0
pope 0
has 0
referred 0
to 0
the 0
auto-demolition 0
of 0
the 0
Church. 0

He 0
said, 0
“The 0
smoke 1
of 1
Satan 1
has 0
entered 0
the 0
Church.” 0
But 0
where 0
are 0
the 0
men 0
responsible 0
for 0
the 0
destruction 0
of 0
the 0
Church? 0

Well, 0
there 0
they 0
are. 0

They 0
are 0
the 0
men 0
who 0
destroy 0
the 0
Church. 0

We 0
must 0
show 0
where 0
they 0
are. 0

Where 0
is 0
this 0
smoke 1
of 1
Satan 1
that 0
has 0
entered 0
the 0
Church? 0

I 0
do 0
not 0
know, 0
but 0
it 0
is 0
the 0
pope 0
himself 0
who 0
said 0
that. 0

And 0
I 0
have 0
these 0
experiences 0
every 0
day. 0

I 0
visit 0
many 0
countries. 0

I 0
was 0
in 0
Spain 0
during 0
the 0
Christmas 0
Holy 0
Days. 0

Then 0
I 0
was 0
in 0
Bonn, 0
near 0
Cologne, 0
Germany, 0
three 0
weeks 0
ago, 0
to 0
speak 0
at 0
a 0
conference. 0

Many 0
people 0
came. 0

Many 0
people 0
are 0
confused. 0

What 0
is 0
happening 0
in 0
the 0
Church? 0

They 0
are 0
anxious. 0

But 0
many 0
people 0
say 0
that 0
we 0
disobey. 0

Disobey? 0

Obedience 0
is 0
relative. 0

It 0
is 0
not 0
absolute. 0

It 0
is 0
relative 0
to 0
the 0
good, 0
but 0
not 0
to 0
the 0
evil. 0

We 0
cannot 0
obey 0
our 0
parents 0
if 0
they 0
command 0
a 0
bad 0
thing. 0

We 0
cannot 0
obey. 0

It 0
is 0
clear. 0

And 0
I 0
know 0
that 0
in 0
Spain, 0
for 0
example, 0
the 0
situation 0
in 0
the 0
Church 0
is 0
very 0
bad. 0

The 0
new 0
nominees 0
of 0
bishops 0
and 0
many 0
auxiliary 0
bishops 0
are, 0
approximately, 0
communist, 0
Marxist, 0
and 0
socialist. 0

And 0
so, 0
a 0
majority 0
of 0
the 0
bishops 0
in 0
the 0
Episcopal 0
Conference 0
of 0
Spain 0
are 0
progressives. 0

They 0
are 0
modernists. 0

Whereas, 0
the 0
majority 0
of 0
the 0
bishops 0
[from 0
Spain] 0
during 0
the 0
Council 0
were 0
conservative. 0

So, 0
Rome 0
is 0
responsible 0
[for 0
the 0
situation 0
of 0
the 0
Church 0
in 0
Spain] 0
because 0
it 0
is 0
Rome 0
who 0
approves 0
the 0
nominations 0
for 0
bishops. 0

And 0
we 0
know 0
in 0
France, 0
in 0
Germany, 0
and 0
in 0
Europe 0
generally, 0
that 0
all 0
of 0
the 0
young 0
bishops 0
are 0
worse 0
[than 0
the 0
bishops 0
in 0
Spain] 0
in 0
that 0
they 0
are 0
more 0
or 0
less 0
Marxist. 0

That 0
is 0
a 0
fact. 0

That 0
is 0
impossible. 0

How 0
can 0
they 0
do 0
that? 0

I 0
do 0
not 0
know. 0

I 1
do 1
not 1
know. 1

I 0
have 0
not 0
spent 0
my 0
whole 0
life 0
in 0
Rome. 0

I 0
do 0
know 0
Rome 0
very 0
well, 0
because 0
I 0
was 0
an 0
apostolic 0
delegate, 0
and 0
I 0
was 0
in 0
the 0
Secretariate 0
of 0
the 0
Secretary 0
of 0
State. 0

And 0
I 0
know 0
that 0
very 0
well. 0

But 0
I 0
think 0
that 0
the 1
devil 1
is 1
in 1
Rome, 1
as 0
was 0
said 0
by 0
our 0
Lady 0
of 0
Fatima 0
and 0
Our 0
Lady 0
of 0
La 0
Salette. 0

We 0
must 0
pray. 0

We 0
must 0
ask 0
God 0
to 0
put 0
an 0
end 0
to 0
this 0
crisis 0
of 0
the 0
Church. 0

Because 1
if 1
this 1
crisis 1
continues, 1
many 1
people 1
will 1
go 1
to 1
hell. 1

They 0
lose 0
the 0
faith. 0

They 0
cannot 0
go 0
into 0
the 0
church. 0

They 0
abandon 0
the 0
faith. 0

You 0
know 0
that 0
many 0
priests 0
have 0
abandoned 0
the 0
faith. 0

Many 0
priests 0
have 0
gotten 0
married. 0

And 0
many 0
sisters 0
have 0
abandoned 0
their 0
congregations. 0

It 0
is 0
a 0
pity. 0

And 0
it 0
is 0
everywhere. 0

I 0
was 0
in 0
Melbourne, 0
Australia, 0
during 0
the 0
40th 0
International 0
Eucharistic 0
Congress. 0

Cardinal 0
Knox, 0
who 0
was 0
the 0
man 0
responsible 0
for 0
the 0
Eucharistic 0
Congress, 0
is 0
now 0
the 0
Prefect 0
of 0
the 0
Congregation 0
for 0
Divine 0
Worship. 0

I 0
read 0
in 0
the 0
newspaper 0
about 0
a 0
Mass 0
Cardinal 0
Knox 0
celebrated 0
during 0
the 0
Eucharistic 0
Congress 0
where 0
sensual 1
dancing 1
was 0
performed 0
at 0
the 0
same 0
time 0
the 0
words 0
of 0
the 0
Consecration 0
were 0
pronounced. 0

That 0
is 0
a 0
sacrilege. 1

You 0
cannot 0
go 0
to 0
that 0
Mass. 0

That 1
is 1
sacrilege. 1

This 0
is 0
a 0
fact. 0

They 0
also 0
called 0
me 0
by 0
phone 0
in 0
Melbourne 0
to 0
say 0
I 0
was 0
on 0
the 0
list 0
of 0
the 0
bishops 0
[attending] 0
the 0
Eucharistic 0
Congress. 0

They 0
asked 0
me 0
to 0
concelebrate 0
Mass 0
with 0
a 0
Protestant 0
pastor 0
and 0
a 0
rabbi. 0

Ay. 1

Impossible. 1

Impossible. 1

No, 1
no, 1
no, 1
no. 1

[applause] 0

This 0
change 0
is 0
not 0
accidental. 0

It 0
is 0
not 0
superficial. 0

It 0
is 0
very 0
deep. 0

Very 0
bad. 0

It 0
is 0
against 0
our 0
faith. 0

Against 1
our 1
faith. 1

And 0
so, 0
we 0
cannot 0
accept 0
this 0
Council 0
and 0
this 0
reform 0
and 0
this 0
orientation 0
even 0
though 0
it 0
comes 0
from 0
Rome. 0

From 0
Rome 0
we 0
expect 0
only 0
the 0
good. 0

We 0
do 0
not 0
expect 0
the 0
bad, 0
the 0
ill. 0
We 0
do 0
not 0
expect 0
the 0
abandonment 0
of 0
adoration 0
in 0
the 0
Mass. 0

We 0
need 0
this 0
adoration. 0

We 0
need 0
to 0
have 0
the 0
faith 0
in 0
the 0
divinity 0
of 0
Jesus 0
Christ. 0

Because 0
all 0
[of 0
this 0
change] 0
is 0
[oriented] 0
against 0
the 0
divinity 0
of 0
Jesus 0
Christ, 0
against 0
the 0
Kingdom 0
of 0
Jesus 0
Christ, 0
against 0
the 0
Real 0
Presence 0
of 0
Jesus 0
Christ 0
in 0
the 0
Mass. 0

It 0
is 0
a 0
sin 0
when 0
we 0
abandon 0
the 0
truth 0
of 0
the 0
Kingdom 0
of 0
Jesus 0
Christ, 0
everywhere, 0
and 0
we 0
abandon 0
the 0
Faith 0
of 0
the 0
divinity 0
of 0
Jesus 0
Christ. 0

He 0
is 0
King 0
because 0
he 0
is 0
God. 0

He 0
is 0
the 0
Son 0
of 0
God. 0

So, 0
He 0
is 0
King 0
by 0
His 0
nature. 0

This 0
is 0
essential. 0

Essential! 1

And 1
if 1
He 1
is 1
God, 1
we 1
must 1
give 1
Him 1
the 1
adoration 1
of 1
God. 1

And 0
so, 0
we 0
cannot 0
accept 0
the 0
diminution 0
of 0
this 0
Truth. 0

Jesus 0
Christ 0
is 0
the 0
Son 0
of 0
God. 0

Jesus 0
Christ 0
is 0
God. 0

That 0
is 0
a 0
fundamental 0
truth 0
of 0
our 0
Faith. 0

And 0
it 0
all 0
depends 0
on 0
this 0
Truth. 0

And 0
we 0
know 0
now 0
that 0
the 0
theologians 0
and 0
the 0
bishops 0
have 0
[a 0
new 0
orientation]. 0

They 0
do 0
not 0
express 0
this 0
truth 0
clearly 0
and 0
perfectly. 0

They 0
are 0
afraid 0
of 0
the 0
truth. 0

That 0
is 0
very 0
bad. 0

And 0
it 0
is 0
the 0
same 0
in 0
Rome. 0

I 0
think 0
they 0
refuse 0
[to 0
grant 0
me 0
an 0
audience 0
with] 0
the 0
pope, 0
[because 0
they 0
are 0
afraid 0
of 0
the 0
Truth]. 0

When 0
I 0
was 0
in 0
Rome 0
one 0
month 0
ago, 0
Mgr. 0

Benelli 0
told 0
me 0
he 0
visits 0
the 0
pope 0
every 0
day. 0

He 0
said 0
that 0
when 0
he 0
left 0
me, 0
he 0
would 0
go 0
immediately 0
to 0
the 0
pope 0
to 0
express 0
the 0
importance 0
of 0
the 0
work 0
we 0
had 0
conducted 0
during 0
our 0
meeting. 0

Immediately, 0
he 0
said, 0
he 0
would 0
be 0
going. 0

So, 0
why 0
do 0
they 0
not 0
grant 0
me 0
the 0
possibility 0
of 0
visiting 0
the 0
pope? 0

Because 0
they 0
are 0
afraid. 0

Meanwhile 0
the 0
Vatican 0
operated 0
a 0
veritable 0
swinging 0
door 0
where 0
actual 0
heretics 0
and 0
schismatics 0
were 0
concerned. 0

Here, 0
again, 0
is 0
Blessed 0
Paul 0
VI, 0
famously 0
meeting 0
for 0
the 0
first 0
time 0
ever 0
with 0
the 0
heretic 0
Archbishop 0
of 0
Canterbury 0
in 0
St. 0
Peter's: 0

Cardinal 0
Villot 0
said, 0
“We 0
are 0
afraid 0
if 0
Msgr. 0

Lefebvre 0
meets 0
and 0
speaks 0
with 0
the 0
pope 0
that 0
perhaps 0
the 0
pope 0
will 0
change 0
his 0
mind.” 0
Because 0
[the 0
pope] 0
is 0
not 0
too 0
sure; 0
the 1
pope 1
is 1
not 1
man 1
of 1
true 1
conviction. 1

He 0
is 0
a 0
mysterious 0
man. 0

We 0
cannot 0
give 0
a 0
definition 0
of 0
the 0
man. 0

He 0
expresses 0
the 0
truth, 0
and 0
then 0
he 0
does 0
the 0
contrary/opposite. 0

Some 0
part 0
of 0
him 0
will 0
speak 0
the 0
truth. 0

Another 0
part 0
of 0
him 0
is 0
open 0
to 0
error. 0

Very 0
curious. 0

And 0
they 0
are 0
afraid 0
that 0
if 0
I 0
reveal 0
the 0
truth 0
[and 0
tell 0
the 0
Pope] 0
“you 0
must 0
affirm 0
the 0
Kingdom 0
of 0
Jesus 0
Christ 0
everywhere 0
and 0
always 0
each 0
day. 0

You 0
must 0
affirm 0
the 0
Real 0
Presence 0
in 0
the 0
Mass 0
- 0
in 0
the 0
Sacrifice 0
of 0
the 0
Mass,” 0
then 0
perhaps 0
it 0
is 0
possible 0
that 0
the 0
Pope 0
will 0
change 0
his 0
mind. 0

And 0
so, 0
Cardinal 0
Villot 0
says, 0
there 0
is 0
a 0
confusion, 0
and 0
they 0
do 0
not 0
want 0
me 0
to 0
visit 0
the 0
pope. 0

It 0
is 0
impossible 0
to 0
admit 0
me. 0

And 0
I 0
know 0
the 0
pope 0
very 0
well! 0

When 0
I 0
was 0
the 0
apostolic 0
delegate 0
to 0
Pius 0
XII, 0
I 0
was 0
going 0
to 0
Rome 0
every 0
year. 0

And 0
during 0
those 0
eleven 0
years, 0
I 0
met 0
Msgr. 0

Montini. 0

I 1
know 1
him 1
very 1
well. 1

He 0
received 0
me 0
twice 0
during 0
the 0
Council, 0
for 0
a 0
private 0
audience 0
with 0
the 0
pope. 0

But, 0
now, 0
with 0
my 0
position 0
against 0
the 0
Council 0
and 0
the 0
reforms, 0
he 0
says: 0
“No, 0
impossible! 0

You 0
must 0
sign 0
in 0
writing 0
that 0
you 0
[accept] 0
the 0
Council 0
and 0
all 0
the 0
reforms 0
before 0
I 0
will 0
receive 0
you 0
in 0
audience.” 0
But 0
I 0
cannot 0
do 0
that. 0

For 0
me, 0
if 1
I 1
do 1
that, 1
then 1
I 1
betray 1
my 1
mother, 1
the 1
Church. 1

The 1
Church! 1

So, 0
I 0
thank 0
you 0
very 0
much 0
for 0
your 0
encouragement, 0
and 0
I 0
must 0
say 0
that 0
we 0
have 0
a 0
very 0
good 0
generation 0
of 0
young 0
men 0
and 0
good 0
vocations. 0

For 0
the 0
coming 0
year 0
we 0
have 0
59 0
applications 0
to 0
our 0
seminary 0
in 0
Econe, 0
Switzerland 0
– 0
applications 0
from 0
the 0
United 0
States, 0
from 0
England, 0
from 0
Germany, 0
from 0
France, 0
and 0
Spain. 0

Good 0
young 0
men 0
with 0
good 0
dispositions 0
are 0
coming 0
from 0
everywhere. 0

And 0
why? 0

Why 0
do 0
they 0
come 0
to 0
this 0
seminary 0
when 0
they 0
know 0
we 0
are 0
in 0
difficulties 0
with 0
Rome? 0

They 0
know 0
that. 0

But 0
still 0
they 0
come. 0

I 0
ask 0
them, 0
why 0
do 0
you 0
come 0
to 0
Econe? 0

You 0
know 0
our 0
situation. 0

They 0
say, 0
“Yes, 0
we 0
know 0
your 0
situation, 0
but 0
we 0
want 0
to 0
become 0
true 0
priests 0
and 0
not 0
protestant 0
pastors 0
or 0
modernist 0
priests. 0

We 0
are 0
coming 0
to 0
your 0
seminary 0
because 0
we 0
know 0
that 0
the 0
end 0
of 0
the 0
priest 0
is 0
to 0
offer 0
the 0
true 0
Sacrifice 0
of 0
the 0
Mass. 0

And 0
so, 0
we 0
are 0
Coming 0
to 0
Econe.” 0

And 0
as 0
I 0
have 0
visited 0
my 0
seminary 0
here 0
in 0
Armada 0
for 0
the 0
past 0
five 0
days, 0
I 0
can 0
see 0
it 0
is 0
the 0
same 0
here. 0

We 0
have 0
very 0
good 0
young 0
men. 0

I 0
also 0
have 0
some 0
Americans 0
in 0
my 0
seminary 0
in 0
Econe. 0

In 0
six 0
weeks 0
I 0
will 0
ordain 0
one 0
American 0
priest 0
from 0
Detroit, 0
who 0
is 0
a 0
very 0
good 0
seminarian 0
and 0
will 0
be 0
a 0
good 0
priest. 0

But 0
these 0
young 0
men 0
refuse 0
to 0
become 0
protestants. 0

They 0
refuse 0
to 0
become 0
modernist. 0

They 0
ask 0
to 0
become 0
true 0
priests. 0

And 0
it 0
is 0
a 0
pity 0
there 0
are 0
not 0
100 0
bishops 0
opening 0
good 0
seminaries. 0

So, 0
I 0
ask 0
you 0
to 0
pray 0
for 0
these 0
seminarians 0
because 0
when 0
they 0
become 0
priests 0
they 0
will 0
have 0
many 0
worries 0
and 0
many 0
difficulties. 0

I 0
think, 0
however, 0
they 0
are 0
very 0
well 0
prepared 0
to 0
deal 0
with 0
these 0
difficulties 0
and 0
worries. 0

And 0
we 0
have 0
confidence 0
in 0
God. 0

Since 0
I 0
began 0
this 0
work 0
six 0
years 0
ago, 0
now, 0
I 0
have 0
evidence 0
that 0
God 0
is 0
assisting 0
us. 0

Because 0
it 0
is 0
impossible, 0
I 0
realize, 0
to 0
do 0
this 0
by 0
myself. 0

We 0
now 0
have 0
houses 0
in 0
Switzerland 0
(3), 0
Munich, 0
France 0
(6), 0
Brussels 0
(1), 0
England, 0
Armada, 0
San 0
Francisco, 0
and 0
New 0
York. 0

In 0
Albano, 0
near 0
Rome, 0
we 0
have 0
a 0
congregation 0
of 0
sisters 0
where 0
I 0
have 0
five 0
vocations 0
from 0
the 0
states 0
(good 0
sisters). 0

And 0
I 0
am 0
building 0
a 0
seminary 0
in 0
Switzerland. 0

It 1
is 1
impossible 1
to 1
do 1
all 1
this 1
without 1
God’s 1
assistance. 1

So, 0
I 0
have 0
confidence. 0

It 0
is 0
impossible 0
for 0
the 0
Church 0
to 0
change 0
its 0
tradition. 0

The 0
tradition 0
of 0
twenty 0
centuries. 0

That 1
we 1
cannot 1
change. 1

The 0
Church 0
is 0
tradition. 0

The 1
Church 1
is 1
tradition. 1

It 0
is 0
not 0
revolution. 0

I 1
thank 1
you 1
for 1
your 1
attention. 1
