Two 0
days 0
later, 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
official 0
story, 0
on 0
August 0
4, 0
1962, 0
the 0
NSA 0
reported 0
that 0
a 0
second 0
Gulf 0
of 0
Tonkin 0
incident 0
occurred 0
and 0
US 0
ships 0
were 0
attacked 0
once 0
again. 0

The 0
next 0
day, 0
without 0
question, 0
on 0
August 0
5, 0
1964, 0
the 0
New 0
York 0
Times 0
reported 0
“President 0
Johnson 0
has 0
ordered 0
retaliatory 0
action 0
against 0
gunboats 0
and 0
‘certain 0
supporting 0
facilities 0
in 0
North 0
Vietnam’ 0
after 0
renewed 0
attacks 0
against 0
American 0
destroyers 0
in 0
the 0
Gulf 0
of 0
Tonkin.” 0
Additional 0
outlets, 0
such 0
as 0
the 0
Washington 0
Post, 0
echoed 0
this 0
claim. 0

The 0
outcome 0
of 0
these 0
two 0
incidents 0
was 0
the 0
passage 0
by 0
Congress 0
of 0
the 0
Gulf 0
of 0
Tonkin 0
Resolution, 0
which 0
granted 0
then-President 0
Lyndon 0
B. 0
Johnson 0
the 0
authority 0
to 0
assist 0
any 0
Southeast 0
Asian 0
country 0
whose 0
government 0
was 0
considered 0
to 0
be 0
jeopardized 0
by 0
“communist 0
aggression.” 0
The 0
resolution 0
served 0
as 0
Johnson’s 0
legal 0
justification 0
for 0
deploying 0
U.S. 0
conventional 0
forces 0
and 0
the 0
commencement 0
of 0
open 0
warfare 0
against 0
North 0
Vietnam. 0

As 0
a 0
result, 0
58,177 0
Americans 1
would 0
lose 0
their 0
lives. 0

Additionally, 0
over 0
one 0
million 0
North 0
and 0
South 0
Vietnamese, 0
including 0
627,000 0
civilians 0
would 0
be 0
slaughtered. 1

But 0
it 0
wasn’t 0
true. 0

At 1
all. 1

In 0
fact, 0
the 0
Gulf 0
of 0
Tonkin 0
incident, 0
as 0
it 0
became 0
known, 0
turned 0
out 0
to 0
be 0
a 0
fictitious 0
creation 0
courtesy 0
of 0
the 0
government 0
to 0
escalate 0
war 0
in 0
Vietnam 0
— 0
leading 0
to 0
the 0
deaths 0
of 0
tens 1
of 1
thousands 1
of 0
U.S. 0
troops 0
and 0
millions 0
of 0
Vietnamese, 0
fomenting 0
the 0
largest 0
anti-war 0
movement 0
in 0
American 0
history, 0
and 0
tarnishing 0
the 0
reputation 0
of 0
a 0
nation 0
once 0
considered 0
at 0
least 0
somewhat 0
noble 0
in 0
the 0
eyes 0
of 0
the 0
world. 0

The 0
truth 0
of 0
the 0
matter 0
was 0
that 0
the 0
Maddox 0
was 0
engaged 0
in 0
an 0
aggressive 1
intelligence 0
gathering 0
operation 0
working 0
hand 0
in 0
hand 0
in 0
coordinated 0
attacks 0
on 0
North 0
Vietnam 0
by 0
the 0
South 0
Vietnamese 0
navy 0
and 0
the 0
Laotian 0
air 0
force. 0

When 0
the 0
government 0
announced 0
that 0
it 0
had 0
been 0
the 0
victim 0
of 0
an 0
unprovoked 0
attack—this 0
was 0
a 0
lie. 0

In 0
the 0
2003 0
documentary 0
The 0
Fog 0
of 0
War 0
, 0
the 0
former 0
United 0
States 0
Secretary 0
of 0
Defense 0
Robert 0
S. 0
McNamara 0
admitted 0
that 0
the 0
August 0
4 0
Gulf 0
of 0
Tonkin 0
attack 0
never 0
happened. 0

In 0
1995, 0
McNamara 0
met 0
with 0
former 0
Vietnam 0
People’s 0
Army 0
General 0
Võ 0
Nguyên 0
Giáp 0
to 0
ask 0
what 0
happened 0
on 0
August 0
4, 0
1964 0
in 0
the 0
second 0
Gulf 0
of 0
Tonkin 0
Incident. 0

“Absolutely 0
nothing”, 0
Giáp 0
replied. 0

Giáp 0
claimed 0
that 0
the 0
attack 0
had 0
been 0
imaginary. 0

In 0
2010, 0
more 0
than 0
1,100 0
transcripts 0
from 0
the 0
Vietnam 0
era 0
were 0
released, 0
proving 0
Congress 0
and 0
officials 0
raised 0
serious 0
doubts 0
about 0
the 0
information 0
fed 0
to 0
them 0
by 0
the 0
Pentagon 0
and 0
White 0
House. 0

But 0
while 0
this 0
internal 0
grumbling 0
took 0
place, 0
mainstream 0
media 0
dutifully 0
reported 0
official 0
statements 0
as 0
if 0
the 0
veracity 0
of 0
the 0
information 0
couldn’t 0
be 0
disputed. 0

Tom 0
Wells, 0
author 0
of 0
the 0
exhaustive 0
exposé 0
“The 0
War 0
Within: 0
America’s 0
Battle 0
Over 0
Vietnam 0
,” 0
explained 0
the 0
media 0
egregiously 0
erred 0
in 0
“almost 0
exclusive 0
reliance 0
on 0
U.S. 0
government 0
officials 0
as 0
sources 0
of 0
information” 0
and 0
“reluctance 0
to 0
question 0
official 0
pronouncements 0
on 0
‘national 0
security 0
issues.’” 0

If 0
due 0
diligence 0
had 0
been 0
performed, 0
and 0
reporters 0
had 0
raised 0
appropriate 0
doubts 0
about 0
the 0
Gulf 0
of 0
Tonkin 0
false 0
flag, 0
it’s 0
arguable 0
whether 0
support 0
for 0
the 0
contentious 0
war 0
would 0
have 0
lasted 0
as 0
long 0
as 0
it 0
did 0
and 0
over 0
a 0
million 0
lives 0
would’ve 0
been 0
saved. 0

Now, 0
retired 0
military 0
officials—who 0
pay 0
attention 0
to 0
history—are 0
even 0
warning 0
about 0
more 0
staged 0
events 0
to 0
pull 0
us 0
into 0
war. 0

“I 0
think 0
the 0
president 0
needs 0
to 0
watch 0
carefully 0
for 0
the 0
potential 0
for 0
something 0
like 0
the 0
Gulf 0
of 0
Tonkin 0
incident,” 0
Col. 0
Macgregor 0
said. 0

“Many 0
of 0
your 0
viewers 0
may 0
not 0
remember 0
that 0
it 0
never 0
happened 0
and 0
we 0
could 0
very 0
well 0
be 0
treated 0
to 0
something 0
like 0
that 0
in 0
the 0
Gulf. 0

We 0
should 0
watch 0
for 0
that, 0
and 0
this 0
is 0
an 0
example 0
of 0
President 0
Trump’s 0
comments 0
on 0
fake 0
news, 0
he 0
should 0
not 0
be 0
sabotaged 0
by 0
fake 0
news.” 0

Indeed, 0
as 0
TFTP 0
has 0
reported 0
at 0
length, 0
nearly 0
all 0
wars 0
in 0
US 0
history 0
have 0
been 0
started 0
over 0
false 0
information. 0
