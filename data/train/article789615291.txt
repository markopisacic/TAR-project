From 0
the 0
playground 0
to 0
geopolitics, 0
appeasing 0
an 0
aggressor 0
invites 0
only 0
more 0
aggression. 0

This 0
timeless 0
truth 0
of 0
human 0
nature 0
is 0
one 0
that 0
we 0
moderns 0
can’t 0
seem 0
to 0
accept. 0

We 0
reflexively 0
assume 0
that 0
a 0
rational 0
accommodation 0
or 0
concessions 0
will 0
be 0
reciprocated 0
by 0
those 0
proven 0
to 0
be 0
ready 0
to 0
use 0
any 0
means 0
necessary 0
to 0
achieve 0
their 0
aims, 0
no 0
matter 0
how 0
amoral, 1
unfair, 1
or 1
vicious. 1

Brett 0
Kavanaugh’s 0
confirmation 0
hearings 0
for 0
the 0
Supreme 0
Court 0
illustrate 0
that 0
this 0
false 0
assumption 0
leads 0
only 0
to 0
more 0
demands, 0
and 0
ultimately 0
to 0
defeat. 0

The 1
last-minute 1
accusations 1
from 1
Christine 1
Blasey 1
Ford, 1
a 1
woman 1
who 1
claims 1
that 1
decades 1
ago 1
Kavanaugh 1
groped 1
her 1
at 1
a 1
high 1
school 1
party, 1
and 1
Deborah 1
Ramirez, 1
who 1
accused 1
Kavanaugh 1
of 1
exposing 1
himself 1
to 1
her 1
at 1
a 1
frat 1
party 1
at 1
Yale, 1
are 1
transparent 1
acts 1
of 1
aggression 1
against 1
the 1
judge 1
and 1
Republicans, 1
one 1
engineered 1
by 1
the 1
Democrats. 1

Senator 0
Dianne 0
Feinstein 0
sat 0
for 0
months 0
on 0
Ford’s 0
letter 0
and 0
then––just 0
as 0
the 1
Dems 1
did 0
in 0
1991with 0
Anita 0
Hill’s 0
charges 0
of 0
sexual 0
harassment 0
against 0
Clarence 0
Thomas’s 0
during 0
his 0
hearings––released 0
it 0
only 0
when 0
Kavanaugh 0
appeared 0
to 0
be 0
heading 0
for 0
confirmation. 0

Feinstein 0
still 0
hasn’t 0
given 0
the 0
Judiciary 0
Committee 0
an 0
unredacted 0
copy 0
of 0
the 0
letter. 0

A 0
few 0
weeks 0
after 0
Ford 0
went 0
public, 0
and 0
after 0
Kavanaugh 0
said 0
he 0
had 0
dairies 0
from 0
that 0
summer 0
detailing 0
his 0
whereabouts, 0
The 0
New 0
Yorker 0
published 0
Ramirez’s 0
account 0
of 0
a 0
drunken 0
party 0
filled 0
with 0
obscene 0
drinking 0
games 0
where 0
he 0
exposed 0
himself 0
to 0
Ramirez. 0

Given 0
that 0
the 0
Democrats 0
had 0
made 0
public 0
in 0
advance 0
their 0
intention 0
to 0
derail 0
the 0
hearings 0
and 0
confirmation 0
by 0
any 0
means 0
possible, 0
the 0
timing 0
of 0
both 0
sexual 0
assault 0
charges 0
reeks 1
of 1
premeditated 0
contrivance 0
intended 0
to 0
delay 0
confirmation 0
as 0
long 0
as 0
possible. 0

But 0
in 0
the 0
face 0
of 0
this 0
naked 1
ploy 1
to 0
bork 0
Kavanaugh 0
and 0
derail 0
the 0
confirmation 0
process 0
for 0
partisan 0
advantage, 0
the 0
Republicans 0
seem 0
to 0
be 0
reverting 0
to 0
their 0
customary 1
preemptive 1
cringe. 1

All 0
the 1
Dems 1
have 0
to 0
do 0
is 1
squeal 1
“sexism” 0
and 0
Republicans 0
start 0
negotiating 0
and 0
offering 0
concessions. 0

Of 0
course, 0
after 0
each 0
concession 0
comes 0
another 0
demand. 0

First 0
the 1
Dems 1
demanded 0
that 0
Ford, 0
a 0
long-time 0
Democrat 0
activist, 0
“be 0
heard.” 0
So 0
last 0
week 0
the 0
Chairman 0
of 0
Judiciary 0
Committee, 0
Chuck 0
Grassley, 0
granted 0
another 0
deadline 0
extension 0
for 0
Ford 0
to 0
decide 0
whether 0
to 0
testify 0
before 0
the 0
Committee 0
on 0
Monday. 0

Senator 0
Dianne 0
Feinstein 0
calls 0
these 0
concessions 0
“bullying 1
deadlines.” 1
As 0
Feinstein 0
put 0
it, 0
“Show 0
some 0
heart. 0

Wait 0
until 0
Dr. 0
Ford 0
feels 0
that 0
she 0
can 0
come 0
before 0
the 0
committee.” 0
Ford 0
doesn’t 0
“feel” 0
like 0
she 0
can 0
testify 0
on 0
Monday 0
because 0
she’s 0
afraid 0
of 0
flying, 0
despite 0
offers 0
from 0
the 0
Committee 0
to 0
travel 0
to 0
her 0
in 0
California. 0

Then 0
she 0
feared 0
for 0
her 0
life 0
because 0
of 0
death 0
threats 0
––threats 0
also 0
made 0
to 0
Kavanaugh, 0
his 0
wife 0
and 0
two 0
young 0
daughters–– 0
so 0
she 0
now 0
demands 0
enhanced 0
security 0
measures. 0

The 0
Committee 0
caved 0
and 0
moved 0
the 0
date 0
to 0
Thursday. 0

So 0
of 0
course, 0
Grassley 0
having 0
been 0
intimidated 0
into 0
giving 0
Ford 0
a 0
chance 0
to 0
address 0
the 0
Committee, 0
Ramirez 0
and 0
her 0
handlers 0
are 0
now 0
demanding 0
the 0
same 0
privilege. 0

“Creepy 1
Lawyer” 1
for 0
porn 0
star 0
Stormy 0
Daniels 0
claims 0
to 0
represent 0
a 0
woman 0
who 0
also 0
should 0
be 0
allowed 0
to 0
testify 0
to 0
the 0
Senate 0
Committee 0
about 0
Kavanaugh’s 0
partying 0
habits 0
while 0
at 0
Yale. 0

We’ll 0
have 0
to 0
see 0
whether 0
Grassley 0
can 0
find 1
the 1
stomach 1
to 1
put 1
an 1
end 1
to 1
the 1
farce 1
of 0
allowing 0
unsubstantiated 0
charges 0
from 0
Democrat 0
activists 0
to 0
waste 0
the 0
Committee’s 0
time. 0

Ford 0
and 0
Dianne 0
Feinstein 0
also 0
keep 0
demanding 0
an 0
FBI 0
investigation, 0
even 0
though 0
no 0
federal 0
crime 0
is 0
being 0
alleged, 0
and 0
any 0
investigation 0
36 0
years 0
after 0
the 0
offense 0
is 0
impossible. 0

Ford 0
can’t 0
remember 0
where 0
and 0
when 0
the 0
alleged 0
assault 0
took 0
place, 0
nor 0
how 0
she 0
got 0
to 0
or 0
went 0
home 0
from 0
the 0
party 0
where 0
it 0
allegedly 0
occurred. 0

Her 1
own 1
details 1
of 1
the 1
event 1
don’t 1
jibe 1
(Four 1
boys 1
or 1
three? 1

One 1
girl 1
or 1
two?). 1

She 0
told 0
no 0
one 0
about 0
the 0
assault 0
until 0
30 0
years 0
later. 0

A 0
“lifelong 0
friend” 0
whom 0
Ford 0
claims 0
was 0
at 0
the 0
party 0
has 0
denied 0
any 0
knowledge 0
of 0
the 0
it, 0
and 0
says 0
she’s 0
never 0
met 0
Kavanaugh. 0

Another 0
friend 0
who 0
reported 0
that 0
the 0
school 0
was 0
abuzz 0
with 0
gossip 0
about 0
the 0
attack 0
(which 0
apparently 0
took 0
place 0
during 0
summer 0
break), 0
retracted 0
her 0
statement. 0

The 0
two 0
men 0
Ford 0
named 0
as 0
possible 0
witnesses 0
to 0
the 0
assault 0
have 0
contradicter 0
her 0
claims 0
under 0
oath. 0

And 0
the 0
accused 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh 0
also 0
under 0
oath 0
vehemently 1
denies 1
the 0
charges. 0

Given 0
that 0
36 0
years 0
have 0
passed 0
since 0
the 0
incident, 0
and 0
the 0
accuser’s 0
memory 0
is 0
so 0
hazy 0
and 0
short 0
on 0
coherent 0
details, 0
the 0
FBI 0
has 0
nothing 0
to 0
investigate. 0

Ramirez’s 0
charge 0
is 0
even 0
flimsier. 0

Here’s 0
a 0
catalogue 0
from 0
the 0
Daily 0
Wire: 0

1. 0

The 0
New 0
Yorker 0
could 0
not 0
find 0
a 0
single 0
witness 0
who 0
could 0
put 0
Kavanaugh 0
at 0
the 0
alleged 0
party. 0

2. 0

The 0
New 0
York 0
Times 0
could 0
not 0
find 0
a 0
single 0
person 0
who 0
could 0
corroborate 0
Ramirez’s 0
claims. 0

3. 0

The 0
man 0
accused 0
of 0
egging 0
on 0
Kavanaugh 0
denied 0
Ramirez's 0
allegations 0
and 0
vouched 0
for 0
Kavanaugh’s 0
character. 0

4. 0

A 0
third 0
person 0
that 0
Ramirez 0
claimed 0
was 0
at 0
the 0
party 0
says 0
she 0
was 0
not 0
there 0
for 0
the 0
alleged 0
incident. 0

5. 0

Ramirez 0
contacted 0
her 0
former 0
classmates, 0
asking 0
about 0
the 0
incident, 0
and 0
admitted 0
she 0
was 0
not 0
sure 0
that 0
Kavanaugh 0
was 0
the 0
male 0
who 0
exposed 0
himself. 0

6. 0

A 0
woman 0
who 0
claims 0
she 0
was 0
“best 0
friends” 0
with 0
Ramirez 0
says 0
Ramirez 0
never 0
mentioned 0
the 0
story 0
and 0
initially 0
said 0
her 0
friend's 0
accusations 0
against 0
Kavanaugh 0
might 0
be 0
“politically 0
motivated.” 0

7. 0

Ramirez, 0
just 0
like 0
Christine 0
Blasey 0
Ford, 0
is 0
a 0
registered 0
Democrat 0
and 0
is 0
dedicated 0
to 0
leftist 0
causes. 0

8. 0

Ramirez 0
wasn’t 0
even 0
sure 0
her 0
memory 0
was 0
correct 0
— 0
until 0
she 0
spent 0
six 0
days 0
going 0
over 0
it 0
with 0
her 1
Democrat 1
lawyer. 1

9. 0

Ramirez 0
admits 0
there 0
are 0
holes 0
in 0
her 0
memory 0
due 0
to 0
how 0
much 0
she 0
drank 0
at 0
the 0
party. 0

10. 0

People 0
who 0
knew 0
Ramirez 0
after 0
her 0
time 0
at 0
Yale 0
say 0
that 0
she 0
never 0
once 0
mentioned 0
the 0
incident 0
— 0
until 0
Kavanaugh's 0
nomination 0
was 0
pending. 0

No 0
law 0
enforcement 0
agency, 0
let 0
alone 0
the 0
FBI, 0
would 0
waste 0
its 0
time 0
with 0
an 0
allegation 0
of 0
a 0
crime 0
decades 0
in 0
the 0
past, 0
and 0
so 0
patently 0
incoherent 0
and 0
lacking 0
in 0
evidence. 0

The 0
“FBI 0
investigation” 0
is 0
another 0
delaying 0
tactic. 0

Ford 0
has 0
finally 0
agreed 0
to 0
testify, 0
set 0
for 0
Thursday 0
for 0
now. 0

But 0
it’s 0
unclear 0
whether 0
Grassley 0
has 0
granted 0
Ford 0
any 0
of 0
her 0
preposterous 1
conditions 1
for 0
testifying: 0
She 0
will 0
take 0
questions 0
from 0
the 0
Committee, 0
but 0
not 0
from 0
outside 0
lawyers, 0
who 0
might 0
not 0
be 0
as 0
gentle 0
as 0
politicians 1
with 1
one 1
eye 1
on 1
the 1
polls. 1

Only 0
one 0
camera 0
can 0
be 0
in 0
the 0
room. 0

Kavanaugh 0
must 0
testify 0
first, 0
a 1
grotesque 1
inversion 1
of 0
our 1
bedrock 1
principle 1
that 1
an 1
accused 1
has 1
the 1
right 1
to 1
confront 1
his 1
accuser’s 1
charges. 1

He 0
can’t 0
be 0
in 0
the 0
room 0
with 0
her, 0
apparently 0
because 0
she’s 0
still 0
traumatized 0
and 0
may 0
start 0
experiencing 0
flashbacks. 0

So 0
much 0
for 0
“I 0
am 1
woman, 1
hear 1
me 1
roar.” 1

Grassley 0
shouldn’t 0
cave 0
on 0
these 0
conditions. 0

They 0
all 0
comprise 0
the 0
old 0
tactic 0
of 0
serially 0
escalating 0
demands 0
that 0
cannot 0
be 0
satisfied 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
compel 0
your 0
enemy 0
to 0
give 0
in. 0

That 0
Grassley 0
and 0
the 0
Republicans 0
would 0
even 0
participate 0
in 0
this 0
absurd 1
show 1
trial 1
is 0
testimony 0
to 0
how 0
deeply 0
the 0
progressive 0
ideological 0
narrative 0
has 0
burrowed 0
into 0
our 0
social 0
and 0
political 0
life. 0

If 0
Ford 0
actually 0
testifies 0
on 0
Thursday, 0
or 0
Ramirez 0
is 0
granted 0
the 0
same 0
concession, 0
nothing 0
material 0
will 0
be 0
gained. 0

Her 0
accusation 0
will 0
not 0
be 0
proved 0
true 0
or 0
false. 0

We 0
will 0
learn 0
nothing 0
about 0
Kavanaugh 0
that 0
makes 0
him 0
any 0
less 0
eminently 0
qualified 0
for 0
the 0
Supreme 0
Court, 0
nothing 0
that 0
can 0
add 0
to 0
the 0
thousands 0
of 0
pages 0
of 0
documents 0
already 0
presented 0
to 0
the 0
Committee, 0
or 0
the 0
hundreds 0
of 0
hours 0
of 0
the 0
judge’s 0
testimony 0
before 0
rabid 1
partisans 1
and 1
office-seekers. 1

But 0
vetting 0
Kavanaugh’s 0
qualifications 0
isn’t 0
the 0
point. 0

The 0
point 0
is 0
to 0
delay 0
confirmation 0
by 0
slandering 0
Kavanaugh 0
and 0
baiting 0
the 0
Republicans 0
into 0
appearing 0
to 0
abuse 0
victims 0
of 0
sexual 0
assault. 0

Why? 0

Facing 0
his 0
likely 0
confirmation, 0
the 1
Dems, 1
egged 0
on 0
by 0
the 0
mainstream 0
media––especially 0
The 0
New 0
Yorker, 0
which 0
published 0
a 0
story 0
too 0
badly 0
sourced 0
even 0
for 0
The 0
New 0
York 0
Times–– 0
are 0
desperately 0
attempting 0
to 0
obstruct 0
and 0
delay 0
the 0
process 0
until 0
after 0
the 0
midterm 0
elections, 0
when 0
they 0
hope 0
they 0
will 0
retake 0
the 0
Senate 0
and 0
thus 0
stop 0
any 0
more 0
Constitutionalist 0
judges 0
from 0
being 0
confirmed 0
to 0
the 0
Court 0
for 0
the 0
rest 0
of 0
Trump’s 0
term. 0

The 0
Democrats 0
have 0
stooped 1
so 1
low 1
with 1
these 1
smears 1
because 0
they 0
know 0
the 0
stakes. 0

The 0
courts 0
and 0
especially 0
the 0
Supreme 0
Court 0
have 0
been 0
critical 0
to 0
the 0
progressives’ 0
program 0
since 0
Woodrow 0
Wilson. 0

The 0
biggest 0
obstacle 0
to 0
the 0
progressive 0
dream 0
of 0
government 0
controlled 0
and 0
managed 0
by 0
a 0
technocratic 0
oligarchy 0
has 0
been 0
the 0
Constitution. 0

Its 0
divided 0
and 0
balanced 0
powers 0
were 0
designed 0
precisely 0
to 0
rein 0
in 0
overreaching 0
ambition 0
and 0
concentrations 0
of 0
power. 0

Hence 0
the 0
Constitutional 0
order 0
must 0
be 0
subverted 0
by 0
the 0
Supreme 0
Court 0
and 0
its 0
unaccountable 0
justices 0
enjoying 0
lifelong 0
tenure. 0

But 0
if 0
Kavanaugh 0
is 0
confirmed, 0
there 0
will 0
be 0
five 0
reliably 0
Constitutionalist 0
justices 0
on 0
the 0
bench, 0
who 0
are 0
unlikely 0
to 0
tolerate 0
judicial 0
usurpation 0
of 0
Congress’s 0
law-making 0
powers. 0

That’s 0
why 0
this 0
current 0
nomination 0
is 0
a 0
hill 0
the 1
Dems 1
are 0
willing 0
to 1
beclown 1
themselves 1
on. 1

Given 0
how 0
obviously 1
partisan 1
and 1
hypocritical 1
this 0
ploy 0
is––doesn’t 0
Keith 0
Ellison’s 0
accuser 0
deserve 0
to 0
be 0
heard 0
and 0
believed 0
too? 0

––why 1
has 1
Grassley 1
so 1
far 1
allowed 1
himself 1
to 1
be 1
played 1
by 1
the 1
Dems? 1

Because 0
Republicans 0
fear 0
the 0
backlash 0
from 0
all 0
those 0
women 0
voters 0
who 0
presumably 0
agree 0
with 0
the 0
fundamentalist 0
feminists, 0
and 0
insist 0
that 0
every 1
accusation 1
of 1
sexual 1
assault, 1
no 1
matter 1
how 1
much 1
it’s 1
unsupported 1
by 1
corroborating 1
evidence 1
or 1
even 1
plausibility, 1
must 1
be 1
believed. 1

This 0
contention 0
itself 0
is 0
an 0
expression 0
of 0
the 0
radical 0
feminist 0
narrative 0
of 0
innate 0
male 0
feral 1
sexuality 1
that 0
makes 0
them 0
sexual 1
predators. 1

The 0
irony 0
is 0
that 0
today’s 0
feminists 0
have 0
been 0
willing 0
to 0
sacrifice 0
the 0
earlier 0
narrative 0
of 0
female 0
power 0
and 0
agency 0
that 0
had 0
been 0
stifled 0
by 0
traditional 0
views 0
of 0
the 0
sexes 0
and 0
their 0
capabilities. 0

Instead, 0
now 0
women 0
are 0
Victorian 1
hothouse 1
flowers 1
too 0
delicate 0
to 0
make 0
their 0
way 0
through 0
their 0
lives 0
without 0
the 0
paternal 0
federal 0
government 0
protecting 0
them 0
with 0
its 0
coercive 0
power. 0

Women 0
have 0
exchanged 0
one 0
form 0
of 0
dependence, 0
and 0
one 0
double 0
standard 0
for 0
another. 0

The 1
Dems 1
are 0
using 0
Ford 0
and 0
Ramirez 0
as 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
Democrats’ 0
transparently 0
dishonest 0
delaying 0
tactics 0
because 0
they 0
know 0
that 0
most 0
Republicans 0
have 0
accepted 0
this 0
duplicitous 0
feminist 0
narrative 0
and 0
fear 0
challenging 0
it. 0

Especially 0
after 0
the 0
recent 0
spate 0
of 0
sexual 0
assault 0
charges––many 0
of 0
them 0
true, 0
some 0
false, 0
others 0
contested–– 0
politicians 0
consider 0
bucking 0
the 0
narrative 0
to 0
be 0
as 0
politically 1
suicidal 1
as 0
proposing 0
to 0
reform 0
Social 0
Security 0
and 0
Medicare. 0

It’s 0
the 0
new 0
third 0
rail 0
of 0
American 0
politics, 0
one 0
that 0
transcends 0
party 0
affiliation. 0

Hence 0
the 0
widespread 0
virtue-signaling 0
on 0
the 0
part 0
even 0
of 0
conservative 0
writers 0
who 0
preface 0
their 0
comments 0
about 0
Ford 0
and 0
Ramirez 0
with 0
prologues 0
full 0
of 0
truisms 0
about 0
how 0
horrible 0
sexual 0
assault 0
is, 0
how 0
its 0
self-proclaimed 0
victims 0
“must 0
be 0
heard,” 0
and 0
how 0
churlish 0
and 0
sexist 0
it 0
is 0
to 0
question 0
the 0
truth 0
of 0
any 0
charge. 0

Grown-ups 0
know 0
all 0
that 0
and 0
don’t 0
have 0
to 0
be 0
reminded 0
every 0
time 0
the 0
subject 0
arises. 0

The 1
Dems 1
know 0
that 0
most 0
Republicans 0
come 0
to 0
this 0
conflict 0
with 0
the 0
huge 0
disadvantage 0
that 0
results 0
from 0
accepting 0
your 0
opponent’s 0
dubious 1
ideology 1
and 1
dishonest 1
narrative. 1

The 0
progressive 0
party 0
can 0
dare 0
the 0
Republicans 0
to 0
ignore 0
the 0
endless 0
specious 0
demands, 0
stop 0
the 0
show-trial, 0
and 0
proceed 0
to 0
a 0
vote 0
on 0
Kavanaugh, 0
because 0
they 0
know 0
the 0
Republicans, 0
fearful 0
of 0
the 0
“optics,” 0
will 0
cave. 0

They 0
know 0
that 0
the 0
eleven 0
male 0
Republican 0
Senators 0
on 0
the 0
Judiciary 0
Committee 0
dread 0
the 0
#MeToo 0
movement 0
casting 0
them 0
as 0
knuckle-dragging 1
Neanderthal 1
sexists 1
who 0
want 0
to 0
“silence” 0
the 0
accuser 0
with 0
their 0
“cavalier 1
treatment 1
of 0
a 0
sexual 0
assault 0
survivor,” 0
as 0
one 0
Ford 0
lawyer 0
has 0
said. 0

Republicans 0
still 0
don’t 0
get 0
that 0
no 0
amount 0
of 0
appeasement 0
will 0
stop 0
the 0
left 0
from 0
demonizing 1
them 1
anyway. 0

Just 0
ask 0
Boy 0
Scout 0
Mitt 0
Romney, 0
who 1
was 1
savaged 1
for 0
his 0
innocuous 0
“binders 0
full 0
of 0
women.” 0

And 0
don’t 0
forget, 0
the 0
old 0
sorta, 0
kinda 0
moderate 0
Democrats 0
like 0
Feinstein 0
and 0
Chuck 0
Schumer, 0
who 0
now 0
have 0
joined 0
the 0
crowd 0
of 0
trendoid 1
socialists 1
armed 1
with 1
torches 1
and 1
pitch-forks, 1
will 0
go 0
along 0
because 0
they’re 0
frightened 0
of 0
their 0
party’s 0
increasingly 1
rabid 1
left-wing 1
base. 1

What 0
can 0
we 0
do 0
to 0
end 0
these 0
confirmation 1
circuses? 1

Just 0
stop 0
holding 0
them. 0

There’s 0
nothing 0
in 0
the 0
Constitution 0
that 0
says 0
the 0
Senate’s 0
power 0
to 0
give 0
“advice 0
and 0
consent” 0
to 0
the 0
president 0
regarding 0
his 0
nominee 0
must 0
entail 0
days 0
of 0
televised 0
hearings 0
replete 0
with 0
caterwauling 1
protestors 1
and 1
grandstanding 1
Senators 1
who’ve 0
already 0
made-up 0
their 0
minds. 0

Invite 0
written 0
questions 0
from 0
the 0
Senate, 0
then 0
schedule 0
one 0
day 0
for 0
the 0
nominee 0
to 0
respond. 0

Don’t 0
put 0
it 0
on 0
television, 0
but 0
make 0
public 0
a 0
written 0
transcript. 0

Remove 0
the 0
television 0
cameras, 0
and 0
attention-craving, 1
politically 1
ambitious 1
Senators 1
will 0
be 0
gone 0
like 0
a 0
cool 0
breeze. 0

For 0
now, 0
Grassley 0
needs 0
to 0
end 0
this 0
farce 1
if 0
Ford 0
doesn’t 0
show 0
up 0
on 0
Thursday 0
or 0
continues 0
to 0
negotiate 0
for 0
more 0
delays 0
and 0
concessions. 0

No 0
more 0
concessions. 0

No 0
more 0
delays. 0

No 1
more 1
ceding 0
control 0
of 0
the 0
process 0
to 0
Democrat 0
Party 0
lawyers. 0

Don’t 0
give 0
Ramirez 0
the 0
time 0
of 0
day. 0

Hold 0
the 0
vote 0
no 0
later 0
than 0
Thursday, 0
or 0
Friday 0
if 0
Ford 0
does 0
show 0
up. 0

Make 0
Senators 0
go 0
on 0
the 0
record 0
with 0
their 0
votes, 0
and 0
hold 0
them 0
to 0
account 0
in 0
November. 0

Put 0
to 0
the 0
test 0
the 1
Dems’ 1
claims 0
that 0
a 0
critical 0
mass 0
of 0
women, 0
many 0
of 0
them 0
with 0
sons 0
they 0
don’t 0
want 0
falsely 0
accused, 0
believes 0
the 0
fundamentalist 0
feminist 0
narrative 0
and 0
will 0
vote 0
accordingly. 0

To 0
borrow 0
Churchill’s 0
definition 0
of 0
appeasement, 0
stop 1
feeding 1
the 1
alligator 1
in 1
the 1
hopes 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
be 1
eaten 1
last. 1

For 0
fifty 0
years 0
the 0
Democrats 0
have 0
proven 0
they 1
will 1
demonize 1
conservatives 0
as 0
racist 0
and 0
sexist 0
no 0
matter 0
how 0
often 0
they 0
bow 0
and 0
scrape. 0

How 0
about 0
acting 0

for 0
a 0

the 1
