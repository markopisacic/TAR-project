it 0 109 2
must 0 109 2
have 0 109 2
been 0 109 2
very 0 109 2
much 0 109 2
on 0 109 2
Kurdish 0 109 2
minds. 0 109 2

As 0 109 3
their 0 109 3
U.S. 0 109 3
allies 0 109 3
watched, 0 109 3
the 0 109 3
Kurdish 0 109 3
peshmerga 0 109 3
fighters 0 109 3
were 0 109 3
run 0 109 3
out 0 109 3
of 0 109 3
Kirkuk 0 109 3
and 0 109 3
all 0 109 3
the 0 109 3

they 0 109 3

alongside 0 109 3

The 0 109 4

army 0 109 4
that 0 109 4
ran 0 109 4
them 0 109 4

The 0 109 5
U.S. 0 109 5

percent. 0 109 5

Iran 0 109 6
and 0 109 6
Turkey 0 109 6
had 0 109 6
warned 0 109 6
against 0 109 6
an 0 109 6
independent 0 109 6
Kurdistan 0 109 6
that 0 109 6
could 0 109 6
be 0 109 6
a 0 109 6

But 0 109 7
the 0 109 7
Iraqi 0 109 7
Kurds 0 109 7
went 0 109 7
ahead. 0 109 7

Now 0 109 8
they 0 109 8
have 0 109 8
lost 0 109 8
Kirkuk 0 109 8

its 0 109 8

all 1 109 8

dead. 1 109 8

More 0 109 9
troubling 0 109 9
for 0 109 9
America 0 109 9
is 0 109 9
the 0 109 9
new 0 109 9

by 0 109 9

American 0 109 10

to 0 109 10
be 0 109 10
as 0 109 10
close 0 109 10
to 0 109 10

it 0 109 10

scores 0 109 11

a 0 109 11

our 0 109 11
15-year 0 109 11
war 0 109 11
in 0 109 11
Iraq 0 109 11
could 0 109 11
end 0 109 11
with 0 109 11
a 0 109 11
Shiite-dominated 0 109 11
Baghdad 0 109 11
aligned 0 109 11

With 0 109 12
that 0 109 12
grim 0 109 12

in 0 109 12
mind, 0 109 12
Secretary 0 109 12

Iran's 0 109 14
Quds 0 109 14

the 0 109 14
Shiite 0 109 14

But 1 109 15
what 1 109 15
if 1 109 15

regime 1 109 15

Haider 1 109 15

Who 0 109 17
then 0 109 17
enforces 0 109 17
Tillerson's 0 109 17
demands? 0 109 17

Consider 0 109 18
what 0 109 18
is 0 109 18
happening 0 109 18
in 0 109 18
Syria. 0 109 18

crushing 0 109 21

But 0 109 22
if 0 109 22
our 0 109 22
victory 0 109 22
in 0 109 22
the 0 109 22
war 0 109 22

is 1 109 22
that 1 109 22
really 1 109 22
a 1 109 22
victory? 1 109 22

Do 1 109 23
we 1 109 23
accept 1 109 23
that 1 109 23
outcome, 1 109 23
pack 1 109 23
up 1 109 23
and 1 109 23
go 1 109 23

Or 1 109 24
do 1 109 24
we 1 109 24
leave 1 109 24

in 1 109 24
Syria 1 109 24

the 0 109 25
crucial 0 109 25
questions 0 109 25
now 0 109 25
before 0 109 25
us. 0 109 25

Would 0 109 26
President 0 109 26
Trump 0 109 26
be 0 109 26
willing 0 109 26
to 0 109 26
fight 0 109 26
a 0 109 26
new 0 109 26
war 0 109 26
to 0 109 26
keep 0 109 26
Iran 0 109 26
from 0 109 26
consolidating 0 109 26
its 0 109 26
position 0 109 26
in 0 109 26
Iraq 0 109 26
and 0 109 26
Syria? 0 109 26

Would 1 109 27
the 1 109 27
American 1 109 27
people 1 109 27
support 1 109 27
such 1 109 27
a 1 109 27
war 1 109 27
with 1 109 27
U.S. 1 109 27
troops? 1 109 27

Would 0 109 28
Congress, 0 109 28
apparently 1 109 28
clueless 1 109 28
to 1 109 28
the 1 109 28
presence 1 109 28
of 1 109 28
800 1 109 28
U.S. 1 109 28
troops 1 109 28

authorize 0 109 28
a 0 109 28
new 0 109 28
U.S. 0 109 28
war 0 109 28
in 0 109 28
Syria 0 109 28
or 0 109 28
Iraq? 0 109 28

If 0 109 29
Trump 0 109 29
and 0 109 29
his 0 109 29
generals 0 109 29
felt 0 109 29
our 0 109 29
vital 0 109 29
interests 0 109 29
could 0 109 29
not 0 109 29
allow 0 109 29
Syria 0 109 29
and 0 109 29
Iraq 0 109 29
to 0 109 29
drift 0 109 29
into 0 109 29
the 0 109 29
orbit 0 109 29
of 0 109 29
Iran, 0 109 29
where 0 109 29
would 0 109 29
we 0 109 29
find 0 109 29
allies 0 109 29
for 0 109 29
such 0 109 29
a 0 109 29
fight? 0 109 29

If 1 109 30
we 1 109 30
rely 1 109 30
on 1 109 30
the 1 109 30
Kurds 1 109 30
in 1 109 30
Syria, 1 109 30
we 1 109 30
lose 1 109 30
NATO 1 109 30
ally 1 109 30
Turkey, 1 109 30
which 1 109 30
regards 1 109 30
Syria's 1 109 30
Kurds 1 109 30
as 1 109 30
collaborators 1 109 30
of 1 109 30
the 1 109 30
PKK 1 109 30
in 1 109 30
Turkey, 1 109 30
which 1 109 30
even 1 109 30
the 1 109 30
U.S. 1 109 30
designates 1 109 30
a 1 109 30
terrorist 1 109 30
organization. 1 109 30

The 0 109 31
decision 0 109 31
as 0 109 31
to 0 109 31
whether 0 109 31
this 0 109 31
country 0 109 31
should 0 109 31
engage 0 109 31
in 0 109 31
new 0 109 31
post-ISIS 0 109 31
wars 0 109 31
in 0 109 31
the 0 109 31
Mideast, 0 109 31
however, 0 109 31
may 0 109 31
be 0 109 31
taken 0 109 31
out 0 109 31
of 0 109 31
our 0 109 31
hands. 0 109 31

Saturday, 0 109 32
Israel 0 109 32
launched 0 109 32
new 0 109 32
air 0 109 32
strikes 0 109 32
against 0 109 32
gun 0 109 32
positions 0 109 32
in 0 109 32
Syria 0 109 32
in 0 109 32
retaliation 0 109 32
for 0 109 32
shells 0 109 32
fired 0 109 32
into 0 109 32
the 0 109 32
Golan 0 109 32
Heights. 0 109 32

Damascus 0 109 33
claims 0 109 33
that 0 109 33
Israel's 0 109 33
"terrorist" 1 109 33
allies 0 109 33
inside 0 109 33
Syria 0 109 33
fired 0 109 33
the 0 109 33
shells, 0 109 33
to 0 109 33
give 0 109 33
the 0 109 33
IDF 0 109 33
an 0 109 33
excuse 0 109 33
to 0 109 33
attack. 0 109 33

Why 0 109 34
would 0 109 34
Israel 0 109 34
wish 0 109 34
to 0 109 34
provoke 0 109 34
a 0 109 34
war 0 109 34
with 0 109 34
Syria? 0 109 34

Because 0 109 35
the 0 109 35
Israelis 0 109 35
see 0 109 35
the 0 109 35
outcome 0 109 35
of 0 109 35
the 0 109 35
six-year 0 109 35
Syrian 0 109 35
civil 0 109 35
war 0 109 35
as 0 109 35
a 0 109 35
strategic 0 109 35
disaster. 0 109 35

Hezbollah, 0 109 36
stronger 0 109 36
than 0 109 36
ever, 0 109 36
was 0 109 36
part 0 109 36
of 0 109 36
Assad's 0 109 36
victorious 0 109 36
coalition. 0 109 36

Iran 0 109 37
may 0 109 37
have 0 109 37
