Gingrich: 0 356 0
The 0 356 0
truth 0 356 0
about 0 356 0
Trump, 0 356 0
Putin, 0 356 0
and 0 356 0
Obama 0 356 0

President 0 356 1
Trump’s 0 356 1
summit 0 356 1
Monday 0 356 1
with 0 356 1
Russian 0 356 1
President 0 356 1
Vladimir 0 356 1
Putin 0 356 1
in 0 356 1
Helsinki 0 356 1
created 0 356 1
a 0 356 1
firestorm 1 356 1
of 0 356 1
controversy. 0 356 1

President 0 356 2
Trump 0 356 2
seemed 0 356 2
to 0 356 2
be 0 356 2
publicly 0 356 2
siding 0 356 2
with 0 356 2
the 0 356 2
Russian 1 356 2
dictator 1 356 2
against 0 356 2
the 0 356 2
American 0 356 2
intelligence 0 356 2
agencies. 0 356 2

The 0 356 3
initial 0 356 3
appearance 0 356 3
was 0 356 3
so 0 356 3
bad 1 356 3
that 0 356 3
I 0 356 3
tweeted: 0 356 3
“President 0 356 3
Trump 0 356 3
must 0 356 3
clarify 0 356 3
his 0 356 3
statements 0 356 3
in 0 356 3
Helsinki 0 356 3
on 0 356 3
our 0 356 3
intelligence 0 356 3
system 0 356 3
and 0 356 3
Putin. 0 356 3

It 0 356 4
is 0 356 4
the 1 356 4
most 1 356 4
serious 1 356 4
mistake 0 356 4
of 0 356 4
his 0 356 4
presidency 0 356 4
and 0 356 4
must 0 356 4
be 0 356 4
corrected 0 356 4
– 0 356 4
immediately.” 0 356 4

After 0 356 5
flying 0 356 5
home 0 356 5
from 0 356 5
Helsinki 0 356 5
and 0 356 5
reviewing 0 356 5
the 0 356 5
tape 0 356 5
and 0 356 5
transcript 0 356 5
of 0 356 5
his 0 356 5
press 0 356 5
conference 0 356 5
with 0 356 5
Putin, 0 356 5
President 0 356 5
Trump 0 356 5
said 0 356 5
he 0 356 5
has 0 356 5
“full 0 356 5
faith 0 356 5
and 0 356 5
support 0 356 5
for 0 356 5
America’s 1 356 5
great 1 356 5
intelligence 1 356 5
agencies” 1 356 5
and 0 356 5
that 0 356 5
he 0 356 5
accepts 0 356 5
“our 0 356 5
intelligence 0 356 5
community’s 0 356 5
conclusion 0 356 5
that 0 356 5
Russia’s 0 356 5
meddling 0 356 5
in 0 356 5
the 0 356 5
2016 0 356 5
election 0 356 5
took 0 356 5
place.” 0 356 5

In 0 356 6
his 0 356 6
remarks 0 356 6
to 0 356 6
members 0 356 6
of 0 356 6
Congress 0 356 6
Tuesday 0 356 6
that 0 356 6
were 0 356 6
televised 0 356 6
by 0 356 6
the 0 356 6
media, 0 356 6
President 0 356 6
Trump 0 356 6
went 0 356 6
on 0 356 6
to 0 356 6
admit 0 356 6
that 0 356 6
he 0 356 6
realized 0 356 6
he 0 356 6
needed 0 356 6
to 0 356 6
clarify 0 356 6
his 0 356 6
statements 0 356 6
in 0 356 6
Helsinki. 0 356 6

The 0 356 7
president 0 356 7
said: 0 356 7
“It 0 356 7
should 0 356 7
have 0 356 7
been 0 356 7
obvious 0 356 7
– 0 356 7
I 0 356 7
thought 0 356 7
it 0 356 7
would 0 356 7
be 0 356 7
obvious 0 356 7
– 0 356 7
but 0 356 7
I 0 356 7
would 0 356 7
like 0 356 7
to 0 356 7
clarify, 0 356 7
just 0 356 7
in 0 356 7
case 0 356 7
it 0 356 7
wasn’t. 0 356 7

In 0 356 8
a 0 356 8
key 0 356 8
sentence 0 356 8
in 0 356 8
my 0 356 8
remarks, 0 356 8
I 0 356 8
said 0 356 8
the 0 356 8
word 0 356 8
‘would’ 0 356 8
instead 0 356 8
of 0 356 8
“wouldn’t.” 0 356 8
The 0 356 8
sentence 0 356 8
should 0 356 8
have 0 356 8
been: 0 356 8
I 0 356 8
don’t 0 356 8
see 0 356 8
any 0 356 8
reason 0 356 8
why 0 356 8
I 0 356 8
wouldn’t 0 356 8
– 0 356 8
or 0 356 8
why 0 356 8
it 0 356 8
wouldn’t 0 356 8
be 0 356 8
Russia. 0 356 8

So 0 356 9
just 0 356 9
to 0 356 9
repeat 0 356 9
it, 0 356 9
I 0 356 9
said 0 356 9
the 0 356 9
word 0 356 9
‘would’ 0 356 9
instead 0 356 9
of 0 356 9
‘wouldn’t’ 0 356 9
… 0 356 9

“I 0 356 10
have, 0 356 10
on 0 356 10
numerous 0 356 10
occasions, 0 356 10
noted 0 356 10
our 0 356 10
intelligence 0 356 10
findings 0 356 10
that 0 356 10
Russians 0 356 10
attempted 0 356 10
to 0 356 10
interfere 0 356 10
in 0 356 10
our 1 356 10
elections. 0 356 10

Unlike 0 356 11
previous 0 356 11
administrations, 0 356 11
my 0 356 11
administration 0 356 11
has 0 356 11
and 0 356 11
will 0 356 11
continue 0 356 11
to 0 356 11
move 0 356 11
aggressively 1 356 11
to 0 356 11
repeal 0 356 11
any 0 356 11
efforts 0 356 11
– 0 356 11
and 0 356 11
repel 0 356 11
– 0 356 11
we 0 356 11
will 0 356 11
stop 0 356 11
it, 0 356 11
we 0 356 11
will 0 356 11
repel 0 356 11
it 0 356 11
– 0 356 11
any 0 356 11
efforts 0 356 11
to 0 356 11
interfere 0 356 11
in 0 356 11
our 1 356 11
elections. 0 356 11

We’re 0 356 12
doing 0 356 12
everything 0 356 12
in 0 356 12
our 1 356 12
power 0 356 12
to 0 356 12
prevent 0 356 12
Russian 0 356 12
interference 0 356 12
in 0 356 12
2018.” 0 356 12

Anyone 0 356 13
who 0 356 13
has 0 356 13
studied 0 356 13
President 0 356 13
Trump 0 356 13
knows 0 356 13
he 0 356 13
hates 0 356 13
to 0 356 13
admit 0 356 13
a 0 356 13
mistake. 0 356 13

His 0 356 14
natural 0 356 14
pattern 0 356 14
is 0 356 14
to 0 356 14
move 0 356 14
forward 0 356 14
and 0 356 14
ignore 0 356 14
mistakes. 0 356 14

For 0 356 15
him, 0 356 15
this 0 356 15
was 0 356 15
a 0 356 15
big 0 356 15
correction 0 356 15
(and 0 356 15
as 0 356 15
I 0 356 15
noted 0 356 15
the 0 356 15
day 0 356 15
before, 0 356 15
it 0 356 15
was 0 356 15
an 0 356 15
absolutely 0 356 15
necessary 0 356 15
one). 0 356 15

President 1 356 16
Trump 1 356 16
then 1 356 16
reminded 1 356 16
everyone 1 356 16
of 1 356 16
the 1 356 16
Obama 1 356 16
administration’s 1 356 16
failures 1 356 16
in 1 356 16
dealing 1 356 16
with 1 356 16
Russian 1 356 16
meddling 1 356 16
in 1 356 16
the 1 356 16
election. 1 356 16

President 0 356 17
Trump 0 356 17
noted 0 356 17
that 0 356 17
President 0 356 17
Obama 0 356 17
and 0 356 17
his 0 356 17
advisers 0 356 17
had 0 356 17
information 0 356 17
that 0 356 17
the 0 356 17
Russians 0 356 17
had 0 356 17
been 0 356 17
working 0 356 17
to 0 356 17
interfere 0 356 17
in 0 356 17
the 0 356 17
election 0 356 17
and 0 356 17
they 0 356 17
ignored 0 356 17
it, 0 356 17
because 1 356 17
they 1 356 17
thought 1 356 17
Hillary 1 356 17
Clinton 1 356 17
was 1 356 17
going 1 356 17
to 1 356 17
win. 1 356 17

President 0 356 18
Trump 0 356 18
said: 0 356 18
“President 0 356 18
Obama, 0 356 18
along 0 356 18
with 0 356 18
(then-CIA 0 356 18
Director 0 356 18
John) 0 356 18
Brennan 0 356 18
and 0 356 18
(then 0 356 18
Director 0 356 18
of 0 356 18
National 0 356 18
Intelligence 0 356 18
James) 0 356 18
Clapper 0 356 18
and 0 356 18
the 0 356 18
whole 0 356 18
group 0 356 18
that 0 356 18
you 0 356 18
see 0 356 18
on 0 356 18
television 0 356 18
now 0 356 18
– 0 356 18
probably 0 356 18
getting 0 356 18
paid 0 356 18
a 0 356 18
lot 0 356 18
of 0 356 18
money 0 356 18
by 0 356 18
your 0 356 18
networks 0 356 18
– 0 356 18
they 0 356 18
knew 0 356 18
about 0 356 18
Russia’s 0 356 18
attempt 0 356 18
to 0 356 18
interfere 0 356 18
in 0 356 18
the 0 356 18
election 0 356 18
in 0 356 18
September, 0 356 18
and 0 356 18
they 0 356 18
totally 0 356 18
buried 0 356 18
it. 0 356 18

And 0 356 19
as 0 356 19
I 0 356 19
said, 0 356 19
they 0 356 19
buried 0 356 19
it 0 356 19
because 1 356 19
they 1 356 19
thought 1 356 19
that 1 356 19
Hillary 1 356 19
Clinton 1 356 19
was 1 356 19
going 1 356 19
to 1 356 19
win. 1 356 19

It 0 356 20
turned 0 356 20
out 0 356 20
it 0 356 20
didn’t 0 356 20
happen 0 356 20
that 0 356 20
way. 0 356 20

“By 0 356 21
contrast, 0 356 21
my 0 356 21
administration 0 356 21
has 0 356 21
taken 0 356 21
a 0 356 21
very 0 356 21
firm 0 356 21
stance 0 356 21
– 0 356 21
it’s 1 356 21
a 1 356 21
very 1 356 21
firm 1 356 21
stance 1 356 21
– 0 356 21
on 0 356 21
a 0 356 21
strong 0 356 21
action. 0 356 21

We’re 0 356 22
going 0 356 22
to 0 356 22
take 0 356 22
strong 1 356 22
action 1 356 22
to 0 356 22
secure 0 356 22
our 0 356 22
election 0 356 22
systems 0 356 22
and 0 356 22
the 0 356 22
process.” 0 356 22

There 0 356 23
are 0 356 23
two 0 356 23
key 0 356 23
facts 0 356 23
in 0 356 23
this 0 356 23
statement. 0 356 23

First, 0 356 24
the 0 356 24
very 0 356 24
people 0 356 24
who 0 356 24
have 0 356 24
been 0 356 24
loudest 1 356 24
in 0 356 24
attacking 0 356 24
President 0 356 24
Trump 0 356 24
about 0 356 24
his 0 356 24
performance 0 356 24
at 0 356 24
the 0 356 24
Helsinki 0 356 24
summit 0 356 24
are 0 356 24
the 0 356 24
people 0 356 24
who 0 356 24
failed 0 356 24
to 0 356 24
protect 0 356 24
America 0 356 24
from 0 356 24
Russian 0 356 24
meddling 0 356 24
in 0 356 24
2016. 0 356 24

The 1 356 25
very 1 356 25
intensity 0 356 25
and 0 356 25
nastiness 1 356 25
of 0 356 25
former 0 356 25
CIA 0 356 25
Director 0 356 25
Brennan 0 356 25
and 0 356 25
former 0 356 25
Director 0 356 25
of 0 356 25
National 0 356 25
Intelligence 0 356 25
Clapper 0 356 25
is 0 356 25
an 0 356 25
attempt 0 356 25
to 0 356 25
distract 0 356 25
attention 0 356 25
from 0 356 25
their 0 356 25
failure 0 356 25
to 1 356 25
protect 1 356 25
America. 1 356 25

It 0 356 26
was 0 356 26
their 0 356 26
duty 0 356 26
in 0 356 26
2016 0 356 26
– 0 356 26
not 0 356 26
candidate 0 356 26
Trump’s. 0 356 26

Second, 0 356 27
the 0 356 27
Trump 0 356 27
administration 0 356 27
has 0 356 27
been 0 356 27
far 0 356 27
tougher 0 356 27
on 0 356 27
Russia 0 356 27
than 0 356 27
President 0 356 27
Obama 0 356 27
ever 0 356 27
dreamed 0 356 27
of 0 356 27
being. 0 356 27

The 1 356 28
Trump 1 356 28
administration 1 356 28
is 0 356 28
taking 0 356 28
real 0 356 28
actions 0 356 28
designed 0 356 28
to 0 356 28
weaken 0 356 28
Russia 0 356 28
and 0 356 28
force 0 356 28
Putin 0 356 28
to 0 356 28
change 0 356 28
his 0 356 28
aggressive 1 356 28
behavior. 0 356 28

The 1 356 29
Trump 1 356 29
administration 1 356 29
has 0 356 29
levied 0 356 29
tough 0 356 29
sanctions 0 356 29
on 0 356 29
Russia. 0 356 29

Also, 0 356 30
President 0 356 30
Trump’s 0 356 30
public 0 356 30
lecture 0 356 30
about 0 356 30
Germany 0 356 30
not 0 356 30
buying 0 356 30
natural 0 356 30
gas 0 356 30
from 0 356 30
Russia 0 356 30
was 0 356 30
aimed 0 356 30
at 0 356 30
cutting 0 356 30
Putin 0 356 30
off 0 356 30
from 0 356 30
hard 0 356 30
currency 0 356 30
worth 0 356 30
tens 0 356 30
of 0 356 30
billions 0 356 30
of 0 356 30
dollars 0 356 30
and 0 356 30
further 0 356 30
weakening 0 356 30
the 0 356 30
Russian 0 356 30
economy. 0 356 30

Furthermore, 0 356 31
President 0 356 31
Trump’s 0 356 31
efforts 0 356 31
to 0 356 31
get 0 356 31
our 0 356 31
European 0 356 31
allies 0 356 31
to 0 356 31
increase 0 356 31
their 0 356 31
defense 0 356 31
spending 0 356 31
has 0 356 31
a 0 356 31
direct 0 356 31

Beyond 0 356 33

consider 0 356 33
these 0 356 33
specific 0 356 33
steps 0 356 33
President 0 356 33
Trump 0 356 33
has 0 356 33
taken 0 356 33
against 0 356 33

Where 0 356 34
President 0 356 34

themselves 0 356 34
(his 0 356 34
response 0 356 34
was 0 356 34
weakness 1 356 34

a 1 356 34
pathetic 1 356 34
scale), 1 356 34
President 0 356 34
Trump 0 356 34
has 0 356 34

When 0 356 35
the 0 356 35

When 0 356 36
the 0 356 36
Russians 0 356 36
retaliated, 0 356 36
the 1 356 36
Trump 1 356 36

closed 0 356 36
the 0 356 36

in 0 356 36

President 0 356 37
Trump 0 356 37
had 0 356 37
previously 0 356 37
shuttered 0 356 37
the 0 356 37

More 0 356 38
than 0 356 38
100 0 356 38
Russian 0 356 38
individuals 0 356 38
and 0 356 38
companies 0 356 38
have 0 356 38
been 0 356 38
sanctioned 0 356 38
for 0 356 38
a 0 356 38
variety 0 356 38
of 0 356 38
reasons. 0 356 38

Despite 0 356 39
the 0 356 39
hysteria 0 356 39
of 0 356 39
the 0 356 39
left, 0 356 39
it 0 356 39
is 0 356 39
impossible 0 356 39
to 0 356 39
see 0 356 39
the 1 356 39
Trump 1 356 39
administration 1 356 39
as 0 356 39
anything 0 356 39
but 0 356 39
firm 1 356 39
in 0 356 39
its 0 356 39
dealing 0 356 39
with 0 356 39
Russia. 0 356 39

Nothing 0 356 40
done 0 356 40
in 0 356 40
Helsinki 0 356 40
made 0 356 40
life 0 356 40
easier 0 356 40
for 0 356 40
the 0 356 40
Putin 0 356 40
regime 0 356 40
in 0 356 40
its 0 356 40
continued 0 356 40
economic 0 356 40
decay 0 356 40
and 0 356 40
diplomatic 0 356 40
isolation 0 356 40
due 0 356 40
to 0 356 40
the 0 356 40
sanctions 0 356 40
regime. 0 356 40

Finally, 0 356 41
a 0 356 41
brief 0 356 41
word 0 356 41
about 0 356 41
the 0 356 41
strong 0 356 41
language 0 356 41
and 0 356 41
vicious 1 356 41
comments 0 356 41
about 0 356 41
the 0 356 41
president. 0 356 41

We 0 356 42
are 0 356 42
in 0 356 42
the 0 356 42
early 0 356 42
stages 0 356 42
of 0 356 42
a 0 356 42
cultural 0 356 42
civil 0 356 42
war 0 356 42
in 0 356 42
which 0 356 42
the 0 356 42
left 0 356 42
sees 0 356 42
itself 0 356 42
losing. 0 356 42

This 0 356 43
is 0 356 43
what 0 356 43
led 0 356 43
me 0 356 43
to 0 356 43
write 0 356 43

With 0 356 43
each 0 356 43
passing 0 356 43

the 0 356 43
radical-extremist 0 356 43
wing 0 356 43
of 0 356 43
the 0 356 43

dominates 0 356 43
the 0 356 43
progressive 0 356 43
wing 0 356 43
more 0 356 43
and 0 356 43
more. 0 356 43

With 0 356 44
President 0 356 44
Trump’s 0 356 44
nomination 0 356 44
of 0 356 44
Judge 0 356 44
Brett 0 356 44
Kavanaugh 0 356 44
to 0 356 44
the 0 356 44
Supreme 0 356 44
Court, 0 356 44
it 0 356 44
was 0 356 44
clear 0 356 44
that 0 356 44
anyone 0 356 44
Trump 0 356 44
nominated 0 356 44
was 0 356 44
going 0 356 44
to 0 356 44
be 0 356 44
attacked. 0 356 44

In 0 356 45
fact, 0 356 45
the 0 356 45
demonstrators 0 356 45
protesting 0 356 45
the 0 356 45
nomination 0 356 45
had 0 356 45
signs 0 356 45
for 0 356 45
all 0 356 45
four 0 356 45
of 0 356 45
the 0 356 45
finalists 0 356 45
and 0 356 45
were 0 356 45
instantly 0 356 45
ready 0 356 45
to 0 356 45
oppose 0 356 45
the 0 356 45
president 0 356 45
regardless 0 356 45
of 0 356 45
his 0 356 45
choice. 0 356 45

Similarly, 0 356 46
Obama-era 0 356 46
national 0 356 46
security 0 356 46
officials 0 356 46
seem 0 356 46
determined 0 356 46
to 0 356 46
use 0 356 46
the 0 356 46
harshest 1 356 46
possible 1 356 46
language 0 356 46
to 0 356 46
attack 0 356 46
President 0 356 46
Trump. 0 356 46

I 0 356 47
think 0 356 47
their 0 356 47
strong 0 356 47
words 0 356 47
and 0 356 47
hysteria 1 356 47
are 0 356 47
driven 1 356 47
by 1 356 47
their 1 356 47
own 1 356 47
guilt. 1 356 47

Whatever 0 356 48
the 0 356 48
Russians 0 356 48
did, 0 356 48
they 0 356 48
did 0 356 48
while 0 356 48
Brennan 0 356 48
was 0 356 48
director 0 356 48
of 0 356 48
the 0 356 48
CIA, 0 356 48
Clapper 0 356 48
was 0 356 48
director 0 356 48
of 0 356 48
national 0 356 48
intelligence, 0 356 48
and 0 356 48
James 0 356 48
Comey 0 356 48
was 0 356 48
head 0 356 48
of 0 356 48
the 0 356 48
Federal 0 356 48
Bureau 0 356 48
of 0 356 48
Investigation. 0 356 48

These 0 356 49
former 0 356 49
officials 0 356 49
attack 0 356 49
Trump 0 356 49
ferociously 1 356 49
to 0 356 49
hide 0 356 49
their 0 356 49
own 0 356 49
failure 0 356 49
and 0 356 49
their 0 356 49
own 0 356 49
guilt. 0 356 49

Just 0 356 50
keep 0 356 50
that 0 356 50
in 0 356 50
mind 0 356 50
the 0 356 50
next 0 356 50
time 0 356 50
you 0 356 50
see 0 356 50
one 0 356 50
of 0 356 50
them 0 356 50
on 0 356 50
TV. 0 356 50

My 0 356 51
prediction 0 356 51
is 0 356 51
that 0 356 51
President 0 356 51
Trump 0 356 51
will 0 356 51
remain 0 356 51
tough 0 356 51
on 0 356 51
Russia, 0 356 51
and 0 356 51
the 0 356 51
Helsinki 0 356 51
press 0 356 51
conference 0 356 51
will 0 356 51
be 0 356 51
seen 0 356 51
as 0 356 51
the 0 356 51
aberration 0 356 51
it 0 356 51
was. 0 356 51
