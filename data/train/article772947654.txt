Newt 0
Gingrich: 0
The 0
truth 0
about 0
Trump, 0
Putin, 0
and 0
Obama 0

President 0
Trump’s 0
summit 0
Monday 0
with 0
Russian 0
President 0
Vladimir 0
Putin 0
in 0
Helsinki 0
created 0
a 0
firestorm 1
of 0
controversy. 0

President 0
Trump 0
seemed 0
to 0
be 0
publicly 0
siding 0
with 0
the 0
Russian 1
dictator 1
against 0
the 0
American 0
intelligence 0
agencies. 0

The 0
initial 0
appearance 0
was 0
so 0
bad 1
that 0
I 0
tweeted: 0
“President 0
Trump 0
must 0
clarify 0
his 0
statements 0
in 0
Helsinki 0
on 0
our 0
intelligence 0
system 0
and 0
Putin. 0

It 0
is 0
the 1
most 1
serious 1
mistake 0
of 0
his 0
presidency 0
and 0
must 0
be 0
corrected 0
– 0
immediately.” 0

After 0
flying 0
home 0
from 0
Helsinki 0
and 0
reviewing 0
the 0
tape 0
and 0
transcript 0
of 0
his 0
press 0
conference 0
with 0
Putin, 0
President 0
Trump 0
said 0
he 0
has 0
“full 0
faith 0
and 0
support 0
for 0
America’s 1
great 1
intelligence 1
agencies” 1
and 0
that 0
he 0
accepts 0
“our 0
intelligence 0
community’s 0
conclusion 0
that 0
Russia’s 0
meddling 0
in 0
the 0
2016 0
election 0
took 0
place.” 0

In 0
his 0
remarks 0
to 0
members 0
of 0
Congress 0
Tuesday 0
that 0
were 0
televised 0
by 0
the 0
media, 0
President 0
Trump 0
went 0
on 0
to 0
admit 0
that 0
he 0
realized 0
he 0
needed 0
to 0
clarify 0
his 0
statements 0
in 0
Helsinki. 0

The 0
president 0
said: 0
“It 0
should 0
have 0
been 0
obvious 0
– 0
I 0
thought 0
it 0
would 0
be 0
obvious 0
– 0
but 0
I 0
would 0
like 0
to 0
clarify, 0
just 0
in 0
case 0
it 0
wasn’t. 0

In 0
a 0
key 0
sentence 0
in 0
my 0
remarks, 0
I 0
said 0
the 0
word 0
‘would’ 0
instead 0
of 0
“wouldn’t.” 0
The 0
sentence 0
should 0
have 0
been: 0
I 0
don’t 0
see 0
any 0
reason 0
why 0
I 0
wouldn’t 0
– 0
or 0
why 0
it 0
wouldn’t 0
be 0
Russia. 0

So 0
just 0
to 0
repeat 0
it, 0
I 0
said 0
the 0
word 0
‘would’ 0
instead 0
of 0
‘wouldn’t’ 0
… 0

“I 0
have, 0
on 0
numerous 0
occasions, 0
noted 0
our 0
intelligence 0
findings 0
that 0
Russians 0
attempted 0
to 0
interfere 0
in 0
our 1
elections. 0

Unlike 0
previous 0
administrations, 0
my 0
administration 0
has 0
and 0
will 0
continue 0
to 0
move 0
aggressively 1
to 0
repeal 0
any 0
efforts 0
– 0
and 0
repel 0
– 0
we 0
will 0
stop 0
it, 0
we 0
will 0
repel 0
it 0
– 0
any 0
efforts 0
to 0
interfere 0
in 0
our 1
elections. 0

We’re 0
doing 0
everything 0
in 0
our 1
power 0
to 0
prevent 0
Russian 0
interference 0
in 0
2018.” 0

Anyone 0
who 0
has 0
studied 0
President 0
Trump 0
knows 0
he 0
hates 0
to 0
admit 0
a 0
mistake. 0

His 0
natural 0
pattern 0
is 0
to 0
move 0
forward 0
and 0
ignore 0
mistakes. 0

For 0
him, 0
this 0
was 0
a 0
big 0
correction 0
(and 0
as 0
I 0
noted 0
the 0
day 0
before, 0
it 0
was 0
an 0
absolutely 0
necessary 0
one). 0

President 1
Trump 1
then 1
reminded 1
everyone 1
of 1
the 1
Obama 1
administration’s 1
failures 1
in 1
dealing 1
with 1
Russian 1
meddling 1
in 1
the 1
election. 1

President 0
Trump 0
noted 0
that 0
President 0
Obama 0
and 0
his 0
advisers 0
had 0
information 0
that 0
the 0
Russians 0
had 0
been 0
working 0
to 0
interfere 0
in 0
the 0
election 0
and 0
they 0
ignored 0
it, 0
because 1
they 1
thought 1
Hillary 1
Clinton 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
win. 1

President 0
Trump 0
said: 0
“President 0
Obama, 0
along 0
with 0
(then-CIA 0
Director 0
John) 0
Brennan 0
and 0
(then 0
Director 0
of 0
National 0
Intelligence 0
James) 0
Clapper 0
and 0
the 0
whole 0
group 0
that 0
you 0
see 0
on 0
television 0
now 0
– 0
probably 0
getting 0
paid 0
a 0
lot 0
of 0
money 0
by 0
your 0
networks 0
– 0
they 0
knew 0
about 0
Russia’s 0
attempt 0
to 0
interfere 0
in 0
the 0
election 0
in 0
September, 0
and 0
they 0
totally 0
buried 0
it. 0

And 0
as 0
I 0
said, 0
they 0
buried 0
it 0
because 1
they 1
thought 1
that 1
Hillary 1
Clinton 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
win. 1

It 0
turned 0
out 0
it 0
didn’t 0
happen 0
that 0
way. 0

“By 0
contrast, 0
my 0
administration 0
has 0
taken 0
a 0
very 0
firm 0
stance 0
– 0
it’s 1
a 1
very 1
firm 1
stance 1
– 0
on 0
a 0
strong 0
action. 0

We’re 0
going 0
to 0
take 0
strong 1
action 1
to 0
secure 0
our 0
election 0
systems 0
and 0
the 0
process.” 0

There 0
are 0
two 0
key 0
facts 0
in 0
this 0
statement. 0

First, 0
the 0
very 0
people 0
who 0
have 0
been 0
loudest 1
in 0
attacking 0
President 0
Trump 0
about 0
his 0
performance 0
at 0
the 0
Helsinki 0
summit 0
are 0
the 0
people 0
who 0
failed 0
to 0
protect 0
America 0
from 0
Russian 0
meddling 0
in 0
2016. 0

The 1
very 1
intensity 0
and 0
nastiness 1
of 0
former 0
CIA 0
Director 0
Brennan 0
and 0
former 0
Director 0
of 0
National 0
Intelligence 0
Clapper 0
is 0
an 0
attempt 0
to 0
distract 0
attention 0
from 0
their 0
failure 0
to 1
protect 1
America. 1

It 0
was 0
their 0
duty 0
in 0
2016 0
– 0
not 0
candidate 0
Trump’s. 0

Second, 0
the 0
Trump 0
administration 0
has 0
been 0
far 0
tougher 0
on 0
Russia 0
than 0
President 0
Obama 0
ever 0
dreamed 0
of 0
being. 0

The 1
Trump 1
administration 1
is 0
taking 0
real 0
actions 0
designed 0
to 0
weaken 0
Russia 0
and 0
force 0
Putin 0
to 0
change 0
his 0
aggressive 1
behavior. 0

The 1
Trump 1
administration 1
has 0
levied 0
tough 0
sanctions 0
on 0
Russia. 0

Also, 0
President 0
Trump’s 0
public 0
lecture 0
about 0
Germany 0
not 0
buying 0
natural 0
gas 0
from 0
Russia 0
was 0
aimed 0
at 0
cutting 0
Putin 0
off 0
from 0
hard 0
currency 0
worth 0
tens 0
of 0
billions 0
of 0
dollars 0
and 0
further 0
weakening 0
the 0
Russian 0
economy. 0

Furthermore, 0
President 0
Trump’s 0
efforts 0
to 0
get 0
our 0
European 0
allies 0
to 0
increase 0
their 0
defense 0
spending 0
has 0
a 0
direct 0
impact 0
on 0
Putin. 0

The 1
stronger 1
NATO 1
is, 1
the 1
less 1
maneuvering 1
room 1
Russia 1
has. 1

Beyond 0
pressuring 0
our 1
allies, 0
consider 0
these 0
specific 0
steps 0
President 0
Trump 0
has 0
taken 0
against 0
Russia: 0

Where 0
President 0
Obama 0
refused 0
to 0
provide 0
serious 0
weapons 0
to 0
the 0
Ukrainians 0
to 0
help 0
them 0
defend 0
themselves 0
(his 0
response 0
was 0
weakness 1
on 1
a 1
pathetic 1
scale), 1
President 0
Trump 0
has 0
approved 0
the 0
sale 0
of 0
offensive 0
weapons 0
to 0
enable 0
the 0
Ukrainians 0
to 0
increase 0
the 0
cost 0
of 0
Russian 0
aggression. 0

When 0
the 0
Russians 0
used 0
chemical 0
weapons 0
in 0
Great 0
Britain, 0
President 0
Trump 0
joined 0
our 1
allies 0
and 0
expelled 0
60 0
Russian 0
intelligence 0
officers 0
from 0
the 0
United 0
States. 0

When 0
the 0
Russians 0
retaliated, 0
the 1
Trump 1
administration 1
closed 0
the 0
Russian 0
consulate 0
in 0
Seattle. 0

President 0
Trump 0
had 0
previously 0
shuttered 0
the 0
Russian 0
consulate 0
in 0
San 0
Francisco 0
and 0
smaller 0
annexes 0
in 0
Washington 0
and 0
New 0
York. 0

More 0
than 0
100 0
Russian 0
individuals 0
and 0
companies 0
have 0
been 0
sanctioned 0
for 0
a 0
variety 0
of 0
reasons. 0

Despite 0
the 0
hysteria 0
of 0
the 0
left, 0
it 0
is 0
impossible 0
to 0
see 0
the 1
Trump 1
administration 1
as 0
anything 0
but 0
firm 1
in 0
its 0
dealing 0
with 0
Russia. 0

Nothing 0
done 0
in 0
Helsinki 0
made 0
life 0
easier 0
for 0
the 0
Putin 0
regime 0
in 0
its 0
continued 0
economic 0
decay 0
and 0
diplomatic 0
isolation 0
due 0
to 0
the 0
sanctions 0
regime. 0

Finally, 0
a 0
brief 0
word 0
about 0
the 0
strong 0
language 0
and 0
vicious 1
comments 0
about 0
the 0
president. 0

We 0
are 0
in 0
the 0
early 0
stages 0
of 0
a 0
cultural 0
civil 0
war 0
in 0
which 0
the 0
left 0
sees 0
itself 0
losing. 0

This 0
is 0
what 0
led 0
me 0
to 0
write 0
my 0
new 0
New 0
York 0
Times 0
best-selling 0
book, 0
“Trump’s 1
America: 1
The 0
Truth 0
About 0
Our 1
Nation’s 1
Great 1
Comeback.” 1
With 0
each 0
passing 0
month 0
the 0
radical-extremist 0
wing 0
of 0
the 0
Democratic 0
Party 0
dominates 0
the 0
progressive 0
wing 0
more 0
and 0
more. 0

With 0
President 0
Trump’s 0
nomination 0
of 0
Judge 0
Brett 0
Kavanaugh 0
to 0
the 0
Supreme 0
Court, 0
it 0
was 0
clear 0
that 0
anyone 0
Trump 0
nominated 0
was 0
going 0
to 0
be 0
attacked. 0

In 0
fact, 0
the 0
demonstrators 0
protesting 0
the 0
nomination 0
had 0
signs 0
for 0
all 0
four 0
of 0
the 0
finalists 0
and 0
were 0
instantly 0
ready 0
to 0
oppose 0
the 0
president 0
regardless 0
of 0
his 0
choice. 0

Similarly, 0
Obama-era 0
national 0
security 0
officials 0
seem 0
determined 0
to 0
use 0
the 0
harshest 1
possible 1
language 0
to 0
attack 0
President 0
Trump. 0

I 0
think 0
their 0
strong 0
words 0
and 0
hysteria 1
are 0
driven 1
by 1
their 1
own 1
guilt. 1

Whatever 0
the 0
Russians 0
did, 0
they 0
did 0
while 0
Brennan 0
was 0
director 0
of 0
the 0
CIA, 0
Clapper 0
was 0
director 0
of 0
national 0
intelligence, 0
and 0
James 0
Comey 0
was 0
head 0
of 0
the 0
Federal 0
Bureau 0
of 0
Investigation. 0

These 0
former 0
officials 0
attack 0
Trump 0
ferociously 1
to 0
hide 0
their 0
own 0
failure 0
and 0
their 0
own 0
guilt. 0

Just 0
keep 0
that 0
in 0
mind 0
the 0
next 0
time 0
you 0
see 0
one 0
of 0
them 0
on 0
TV. 0

My 0
prediction 0
is 0
that 0
President 0
Trump 0
will 0
remain 0
tough 0
on 0
Russia, 0
and 0
the 0
Helsinki 0
press 0
conference 0
will 0
be 0
seen 0
as 0
the 0
aberration 0
it 0
was. 0
