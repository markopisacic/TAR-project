WASHINGTON 0
— 0
Attorney 0
General 0
Jeff 0
Sessions 0
has 0
a 0
message 0
for 0
Donald 0
Trump: 0
You’re 1
wrong, 1
Mr. 1
President. 1

Sessions 0
long 0
has 0
been 0
one 1
of 1
Trump’s 1
favorite 1
pinatas, 1
often 0
taking 0
the 0
brunt 0
of 0
the 1
president’s 1
public 1
scorn. 1

Trump 0
offered 0
this 0
assessment 0
of 0
his 0
hand-picked 0
attorney 0
general 0
recusing 0
himself 0
from 0
the 0
Justice 0
Department’s 0
special 0
counsel 0
probe 0
of 0
Russian 0
election 0
meddling: 0
“What 1
kind 1
of 1
man 1
is 1
this?” 1

Trump, 0
in 0
an 0
interview 0
that 0
aired 0
Thursday 0
morning, 0
also 0
blasted 1
Sessions 0
because, 0
he 0
said, 0
the 1
former 1
Alabama 1
senator 1
“never 1
took 1
control 1
of 1
the 1
Justice 1
Department.” 1

About 0
seven 0
hours 0
later, 0
the 0
country’s 0
top 0
law 0
enforcement 0
officer 0
fired 1
back. 1

And, 0
by 0
doing 0
so, 0
took 0
on 0
Trump 0
publicly 0
in 0
a 0
way 0
few 0
Republicans 0
in 0
Washington 0
have 0
during 0
his 0
turbulent 0
19-month-old 0
presidency. 0

“I 0
took 0
control 0
of 0
the 0
Department 0
of 0
Justice 0
the 0
day 0
I 0
was 0
sworn 0
in, 0
which 0
is 0
why 0
we 0
have 0
had 0
unprecedented 1
success 1
at 1
effectuating 1
the 1
President’s 1
agenda 1
— 0
one 1
that 1
protects 1
the 1
safety 1
and 1
security 1
and 1
rights 1
of 1
the 1
American 1
people, 1
reduces 1
violent 1
crime, 1
enforces 1
our 1
immigration 1
laws, 1
promotes 1
economic 1
growth, 1
and 1
advances 1
religious 1
liberty,” 1
the 0
AG 0
said 0
in 0
a 0
statement. 0

“While 0
I 0
am 0
Attorney 0
General, 0
the 0
actions 0
of 0
the 0
Department 0
of 0
Justice 0
will 0
not 0
be 0
improperly 0
influenced 0
by 0
political 0
considerations. 0

I 0
demand 0
the 0
highest 0
standards, 0
and 0
where 0
they 0
are 0
not 0
met, 0
I 0
take 0
action,” 0
Sessions 0
added. 0

“However, 1
no 1
nation 1
has 1
a 1
more 1
talented, 1
more 1
dedicated 1
group 1
of 1
law 1
enforcement 1
investigators 1
and 1
prosecutors 1
than 1
the 1
United 1
States.” 1

That 0
last 0
statement 0
comes 0
amid 0
nearly 1
constant 1
complaints 1
from 1
Trump 1
that 0
Justice 0
Department 0
and 0
FBI 0
investigators 0
are 0
being 0
unfair 0
to 0
the 0
president 0
and 0
his 0
allies. 0

That 0
line 0
of 0
criticism 0
has 0
been 0
picked 0
up 0
by, 0
among 0
others, 0
Rep. 0
Duncan 0
Hunter, 0
R-Calif., 0
who 0
was 0
indicted 0
on 0
federal 0
officials 0
this 0
week 0
on 0
charges 0
of 0
misusing 0
campaign 0
finance 0
funds 0
for 0
personal 0
use. 0

Trump 0
did 0
not 0
directly 0
answer 0
a 0
Fox 0
News 0
interviewer’s 0
question 0
about 0
whether 0
he 0
intends 0
to 0
fire 0
Sessions 0
and 0
Deputy 0
Attorney 0
General 0
Rod 0
Rosenstein, 0
who 0
is 0
overseeing 0
the 0
special 0
counsel 0
investigation, 0
after 0
November’s 0
congressional 0
elections. 0

He 0
also 0
said 0
he 0
only 0
gave 0
the 0
former 0
senator 0
the 0
job 0
because 0
Sessions 0
was 0
a 0
supporter 0
during 0
the 0
2016 0
presidential 0
race. 0
