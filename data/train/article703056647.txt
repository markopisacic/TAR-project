The 0
bubonic 0
plague 0
outbreak 0
that 0
is 0
taking 0
Madagascar 0
to 0
its 0
knees 0
will 0
more 0
than 0
likely 0
last 0
another 0
six 0
months. 0

But 0
the 0
worst 0
news 0
is 0
that 0
the 1
epidemic 1
could 1
explode 1
anytime 1
unleashing 1
the 1
sickness 1
on 1
the 1
globe. 1

At 0
least 0
128 0
people 0
have 0
been 0
killed 0
and 0
more 0
than 0
1,300 0
infected 0
by 0
the 0
deadlier 0
pneumonic 0
strain 0
of 0
the 0
medieval 0
disease. 0

But 0
the 0
oncoming 0
rainy 0
season 0
could 0
see 0
the 0
number 0
of 0
those 0
infected 0
explode 1
exponentially. 0

The 0
rainy 0
season 0
poses 0
a 0
threat 0
to 0
the 0
containment 0
of 0
the 0
plague 0
because 0
outbreaks 0
of 0
this 0
magnitude 0
often 0
seem 0
to 0
be 0
seasonal. 0

The 0
Foreign 0
Office 0
recently 0
warned 0
that 0
the 1
deadly 1
outbreak 1
is 1
entering 1
its 1
most 1
dangerous 1
phase. 1

Its 0
website 0
said 0
that 0
“outbreaks 0
of 0
plague 0
tend 0
to 0
be 0
seasonal 0
and 0
occur 0
mainly 0
during 0
the 0
rainy 0
season.” 0
The 0
African 0
island’s 0
wet 0
season 0
officially 0
began 0
today 0
and 0
will 0
last 0
until 0
the 0
end 0
of 0
April, 0
meaning 0
the 1
downward 1
trend 1
the 1
plague 1
had 1
seen 1
over 1
the 1
past 1
few 1
days, 1
will 1
likely 1
turn 1
upward 1
again. 1

Because 0
the 0
disease 0
can 0
be 0
spread 0
easily 0
through 0
a 0
cough 0
or 0
sneeze, 0
experts 0
are 0
fearful. 0

It 1
would 1
take 1
just 1
one 1
infected 1
traveler 0
who 0
made 0
it 0
to 0
Africa’s 0
mainland 0
or 0
even 0
nearby 0
British 0
honeymoon 0
paradises 0
like 0
Mauritius, 0
the 0
Maldives 0
or 0
the 0
Seychelles 0
to 0
spread 0
the 0
disease 0
globally. 0

The 0
Seychelles 0
is 0
currently 0
putting 0
anyone 0
traveling 0
from 0
Madagascar 0
into 0
quarantine 0
on 0
arrival 0
as 0
a 0
precaution. 0

The 1
outbreak 1
has 1
been 1
fueled 1
by 1
performing 1
the 1
ancient 1
practice 1
of 1
Famadihana. 1

Famadihana 0
is 0
the 0
“dancing 0
with 0
the 0
dead” 0
ritual 0
which 0
sees 0
locals 0
dig 0
up 0
deceased 0
relatives 0
and 0
dance 0
with 0
them 0
before 0
they 0
are 0
reburied. 0

Just 0
contact 0
with 0
a 0
corpse 0
who’s 0
death 0
was 0
because 0
they 0
contracted 0
the 0
plague 0
could 0
sicken 0
a 0
person. 0
