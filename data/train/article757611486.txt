ostensibly 0 220 16

a 0 220 16

exercise. 0 220 16

Parent 0 220 17
Rich 0 220 17
Penkoski 0 220 17
recounted: 0 220 17
“I 0 220 17
saw 0 220 17
the 0 220 17
assignment 0 220 17
of 0 220 17
writing 0 220 17
the 0 220 17
Shahada 0 220 17
in 0 220 17
Arabic. 0 220 17

Their 0 220 18
excuse 0 220 18
was 0 220 18
calligraphy. 0 220 18

I 0 220 19
was 0 220 19
like, 0 220 19
‘Whoa! 1 220 19

Whoa! 1 220 20

Whoa!’ 1 220 21
First 0 220 21
of 0 220 21
all, 0 220 21
calligraphy 0 220 21
was 0 220 21
invented 0 220 21
in 0 220 21
China 0 220 21
3,000 0 220 21
years 0 220 21
prior 0 220 21
to 0 220 21
Muhammad. 0 220 21

The 0 220 22
fact 0 220 22
that 0 220 22
they 0 220 22
were 0 220 22
trying 0 220 22
to 0 220 22
get 0 220 22
my 0 220 22
daughter 0 220 22
to 0 220 22
write 0 220 22
that 0 220 22
disturbed 0 220 22
me. 0 220 22

I 0 220 23
said, 0 220 23
‘That 0 220 23
is 0 220 23
not 0 220 23
happening. 0 220 23

My 0 220 24
daughter 0 220 24
is 0 220 24
not 0 220 24
doing 0 220 24
that.’ 0 220 24
My 0 220 24
daughter 0 220 24
told 0 220 24
me 0 220 24
that 0 220 24
if 0 220 24
she 0 220 24
didn’t 0 220 24
do 0 220 24
the 0 220 24
assignment, 0 220 24
then 0 220 24
she 0 220 24
was 0 220 24
going 0 220 24
to 0 220 24
get 0 220 24
a 0 220 24
[detention] 0 220 24
slip.” 0 220 24

Branch 0 220 25
contradicted 0 220 25
Penkoski, 0 220 25
claiming: 0 220 25
“The 0 220 25
teacher 0 220 25
has 0 220 25
told 0 220 25
her 0 220 25
class 0 220 25
several 0 220 25
times 0 220 25
that 0 220 25
this 0 220 25

a 0 220 25
study 0 220 25
of 0 220 25
world 0 220 25

and 0 220 25
that 0 220 25
she 0 220 25

any 0 220 25

She 0 220 26
has 0 220 26
told 0 220 26
her 0 220 26
class 0 220 26
that 0 220 26

they 0 220 26
had 0 220 26
questions 0 220 26
about 0 220 26
religious 0 220 26
beliefs, 0 220 26
that 0 220 26
those 0 220 26
conversations 0 220 26
should 0 220 26
take 0 220 26
place 0 220 26
with 0 220 26
their 0 220 26
parents.” 0 220 26
He 0 220 26
said 0 220 26
that 0 220 26
Christianity 0 220 26
and 0 220 26
Judaism 0 220 26
were 0 220 26
given 0 220 26
“equitable 0 220 26
treatment” 0 220 26
in 0 220 26
the 0 220 26

class. 0 220 26

Penkoski’s 0 220 27
daughter, 0 220 27
Brielle, 0 220 27
however, 0 220 27
said 0 220 27
that 0 220 27
the 0 220 27
class 0 220 27
spent 0 220 27
much 0 220 27
less 0 220 27
time 0 220 27
on 0 220 27
Christianity 0 220 27
and 0 220 27
Judaism 0 220 27
than 0 220 27
it 0 220 27
did 0 220 27
on 0 220 27
Islam. 0 220 27

Penkoski 0 220 28
pointed 0 220 28
out 0 220 28
that 0 220 28
the 0 220 28
accompanying 0 220 28
exercises 0 220 28
were 0 220 28
also 0 220 28

extensive 0 220 28
for 0 220 28
Christianity 0 220 28
and 0 220 28
Judaism 0 220 28
than 0 220 28
they 0 220 28
were 0 220 28
for 0 220 28
Islam: 0 220 28
“Notice 0 220 28

Chris 0 220 45
Marczak, 0 220 45

the 0 220 45
curriculum: 0 220 45
“It 0 220 45
is 0 220 45
our 0 220 45

in 0 220 45

to 0 220 45
be 0 220 45
ready 0 220 45
to 0 220 45
compete 0 220 45
in 0 220 45
a 0 220 45
global 0 220 45
society, 0 220 45
not 0 220 45
to 0 220 45
endorse 0 220 45
one 0 220 45

another 0 220 45

indoctrinate.” 1 220 45
Porterfield, 0 220 45
however, 0 220 45
shot 0 220 45
back: 0 220 45
“They 0 220 45
are 0 220 45
not 0 220 45
going 0 220 45
over 0 220 45

So 0 220 46
for 0 220 46
the 0 220 46
students 0 220 46
to 0 220 46
have 0 220 46
to 0 220 46
memorize 0 220 46
this 0 220 46
prayer, 0 220 46
it 0 220 46
does 0 220 46
seem 0 220 46
like 0 220 46
it 0 220 46
is 0 220 46
indoctrination.” 1 220 46

None 0 220 47
of 0 220 47
the 0 220 47
encroachments 0 220 47
of 0 220 47
Islam 0 220 47
in 0 220 47
public 0 220 47
schools 0 220 47
should 0 220 47
come 0 220 47
as 0 220 47
any 0 220 47
real 0 220 47
surprise. 0 220 47

Multiculturalism, 0 220 48
after 0 220 48
all, 0 220 48
amounts 0 220 48
to 0 220 48
respect 0 220 48
for 0 220 48
every 0 220 48
culture 0 220 48
except 0 220 48
one’s 0 220 48
own. 0 220 48

The 0 220 49
embarrassment, 0 220 49
regret, 0 220 49
and 0 220 49
even 0 220 49
self-hatred 0 220 49
that 0 220 49
has 0 220 49
been 0 220 49
inculcated 0 220 49
in 0 220 49
American 0 220 49
public 0 220 49
school 0 220 49
students 0 220 49
for 0 220 49
decades 0 220 49
now 0 220 49
has 0 220 49
created 0 220 49
a 0 220 49
vacuum, 0 220 49
which 0 220 49
Muslims 0 220 49
have 0 220 49
shown 0 220 49
themselves 0 220 49
to 0 220 49
be 0 220 49
all 0 220 49
too 0 220 49
eager 0 220 49
to 0 220 49
fill. 0 220 49

Certainly, 0 220 50
those 0 220 50
who 0 220 50
are 0 220 50
furthering 0 220 50
the 0 220 50
Islamization 0 220 50
of 0 220 50
the 0 220 50
schools 0 220 50
would 0 220 50
deny 0 220 50
that 0 220 50
they 0 220 50
would 0 220 50
like 0 220 50
to 0 220 50
see 0 220 50
Islamic 0 220 50
law 0 220 50
implemented 0 220 50
in 0 220 50
the 0 220 50
United 0 220 50
States, 0 220 50
and 0 220 50
would 0 220 50
indignantly 0 220 50
reject 0 220 50
the 0 220 50
claim 0 220 50
that 0 220 50
their 0 220 50
efforts 0 220 50
were 0 220 50
furthering 0 220 50
that 0 220 50
end 0 220 50
in 0 220 50
any 0 220 50
way. 0 220 50

They 0 220 51
would 0 220 51
say 0 220 51
that 0 220 51
they 0 220 51
are 0 220 51
doing 0 220 51
it 0 220 51
all 0 220 51
for 0 220 51
tolerance, 0 220 51
pluralism, 0 220 51
and 0 220 51
multiculturalism. 0 220 51

Unfortunately, 0 220 52
in 0 220 52
the 0 220 52
end, 0 220 52
it 0 220 52
amounts 0 220 52
to 0 220 52
the 0 220 52
same 0 220 52
thing. 0 220 52
