was 0
named 0
as 0
a 0
"person 0
of 0
interest" 0
in 0
the 0

by 0
mistake 0
Tuesday 0
when 0

nearly 0
four 0

why 0

considered 0
Haig 0
a 0
person 0
of 0

and 0

haven't 0
said 0
whether 0
he 0
has 0
since 0
been 0
cleared 0
of 0
that 0

Victor 0
said 0
his 0
client 0
sold 0
ammunition 0
to 0
Paddock 0
once 0
and 0
doesn't 0
believe 0
they 0
have 0
communicated 0
since. 0

"He 0
is 0
as 0

(to 0

the 1

him 1
a 1

each 0
declined 0
Wednesday 0
to 0
comment 0
about 0
Haig 0
or 0
the 0
investigation. 0

A 0
law 0
enforcement 0
official 0
told 0
The 0
Associated 0
Press 0
in 0
October 0
that 0
Paddock 0
bought 0
1,000 0
rounds 0
of 0
tracer 0
ammunition 0
from 0
a 0
private 0
seller 0
he 0
met 0
at 0
a 0
Phoenix 0
gun 0
show 0
three 0
weeks 0
before 0
the 0
shooting. 0

The 0
official 0
spoke 0
anonymously 0
because 0
they 0
weren't 0
authorized 0
to 0
disclose 0
case 0
information. 0

Tracer 0
bullets 0
contain 0
a 0

so 0

can 0
see 0
whether 0
their 0
aim 0
is 0
correct. 0

Haig 0
told 0
the 0
AP 0
on 0
Tuesday 0
that 0
he 0
sold 0
unspecified 0
ammunition 0
to 0
Paddock. 0

He 0
also 0
told 0
"CBS 0
This 0
Morning" 0
on 0
Wednesday 0
that 0
he 0
sold 0
more 0
than 0
700 0
rounds 0
of 0
ammunition 0
to 0
Paddock. 0

"I 0
couldn't 0
detect 0
anything 0
wrong 0
with 0
this 0
guy," 0
he 0
said 0
of 0
Paddock. 0

The 0
ammunition 0
sale 0
took 0
place 0
at 0
Haig's 0
home 0
in 0
Mesa, 0
because 0
he 0
didn't 0
have 0
all 0
the 0
ammunition 0
on 0
hand 0
that 0
Paddock 0
wanted 0
while 0
at 0
the 0
gun 0
show. 0

Victor 0
said 0
a 0
box 0
that 0
Paddock 0
used 0
to 0
carry 0
ammunition 0
out 0
of 0
Haig's 0
house 0
and 0
bore 0
his 0
client's 0
name 0
was 0
later 0
found 0
in 0
the 0
Las 0
Vegas 0
hotel 0
where 0
the 0
attack 0
was 0
launched. 0

It's 0
unknown 0
whether 0
the 0
ammunition 0
Haig 0
sold 0
to 0
Paddock 0
was 0
used 0
in 0
the 0
attack. 0

The 0
lawyer 0
said 0
the 0
type 0
and 0
quantity 0
of 0
ammunition 0
Paddock 0
bought 0
from 0
his 0
client 0
wasn't 0
unusual. 0

there 0
are 0
no 0
restrictions 0
on 0
the 0
amount 0
of 0
ammunition 0
a 0
person 0
can 0
buy, 0

a 0

not 0

do 0
they 0

that 0

keep 0
a 0

transactions. 0

"If 0
you 0

the 0
business 0
of 0
selling 0
anything, 0
you 0
are 0
usually 0
happy 0
to 0
