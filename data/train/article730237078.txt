just 0
how 0

Yeah, 1
it’s 1
kind 1

originally 0
launched 0

back 0
in 0
early 0
2006, 0

it 0

during 0
its 0
more 0
than 0
a 0
decade 0
of 0
cruising 0
through 0
our 0
Solar 0
System. 0

Its 0
primary 0
mission 0
was 0
set 0
to 0
last 0
roughly 0
10 0
years, 0
but 0
was 0
extended 0
once 0
it 0

clear 0
that 0
the 0

enough 0

wrap 0
up 0

a 0

that 0

be 0
the 0

we 0
hear 0
from 0
New 0

as 0
its 0
power 0

continue 0

If 0
it 0
