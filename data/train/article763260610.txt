The 1
Eerie 1
Silence 1

In 0

communication 0
between 0
Randy 0
Credico, 0
an 0
Assange 0
supporter, 0
comic 0
and 0
radio 0
producer, 0
and 0
Adam 0
Schiff, 0
the 0
ranking 0
member 0
on 0
the 0
House 0
Judiciary 0
Committee, 0
Assange’s 0
fear 0
of 0
arrest 0
and 0
extradition 0
to 0
the 0
US 0
was 0
confirmed 0
by 0
the 1
leader 1
of 1
the 1
Russia-gate 1
frenzy. 1

Credico 0
received 0
the 0
following 0
response 0
from 0
Schiff 0
after 0
meeting 0
the 0
Congressman’s 0
staff, 0
in 0
which 0
Credico 0
was 0
trying 0
to 0
connect 0
Assange 0
with 0
Schiff: 0
“Our 0
committee 0
would 0
be 0
willing 0
to 0
interview 0
Assange 0
when 0
he 0
is 0
in 0
U.S. 0

Custody 0
and 0
not 0
before.” 0

Dennis 0
Bernstein 0
spoke 0
with 0
John 0
Pilger, 0
a 0
close 0
friend 0
and 0
supporter 0
of 0
Assange 0
on 0
May 0
29. 0

The 0
interview 0
began 0
with 0
the 0
statement 0
Bernstein 0
delivered 0
for 0
Pilger 0
at 0
the 1
Left 1
Forum 1
last 0
weekend 0
in 0
New 0

on 0
a 0
panel 0
devoted 0
to 0
Assange 0
entitled, 0
“Russia-gate 0
and 0
WikiLeaks”. 0

Pilger’s 0
Statement 0

“There 0
is 0
a 0
silence 0
among 0
many 0
who 0
call 0
themselves 0
left. 0

The 0
silence 0
is 0
Julian 0
Assange. 0

As 0
every 0
false 0
accusation 0
has 0
fallen 0
away, 0
every 0
bogus 1
smear 1
shown 0
to 0
be 0
the 0
work 0
of 0
political 0
enemies, 0
Julian 0
stands 0
vindicated 0
as 0
one 1
who 1
has 1
exposed 1
a 1
system 1
that 1
threatens 1
humanity. 1

… 0
these 0
are 0
just 0
a 0

of 1
raw 1
truth 1
that 1
have 1
blown 1
through 1
the 1
capitals 1
of 1
rapacious 1
power. 1

The 1
fakery 1
of 0
Russia-gate, 0
the 0
collusion 0
of 0
a 0
corrupt 1
media 1
and 0
the 0
shame 0
of 0
a 0

that 0

not 0

able 0
to 0
hold 0
back 0
the 1
raw 1
truth 1
of 0

revelations. 0

They 0
have 0
not 0
won, 0
not 0
yet, 0
and 0
they 0
have 1
not 1
destroyed 1
the 1
man. 1

Only 1
the 1
silence 1
of 1
good 1
people 1
will 1
allow 1
them 1
to 1
win. 1

Julian 0
Assange 0
has 0
never 0
been 0
more 0
isolated. 0

He 0
needs 0
your 0
support 0
and 0
your 0

than 0
ever 0
is 0

Dennis 0
Bernstein: 0
We 0
continue 0
our 0
discussion 0
of 0
the 0
case 0
of 0
Julian 0
Assange, 0
now 0
in 0
the 0
Ecuadorian 0
embassy 0
in 0
Great 0
Britain. 0

John 0
Pilger, 0
it 0
is 0
great 0
to 0
talk 0
to 0
you 0
again. 0

But 0
it 0
is 0
a 1
profound 1
tragedy, 1
John, 0
the 0
way 0
they 0
are 0
treating 0
Julian 0
Assange, 0
this 0
prolific 1
journalist 1
and 1
publisher 1
who 0
so 0
many 0
other 0
journalists 0
have 0
depended 0
on 0
in 0
the 0
past. 0

He 0
has 0
been 0
totally 1
left 1
out 1
in 1
the 1
cold 1
to 1
fend 1
for 1
himself. 1

John 0
Pilger: 0
I 0
have 0
never 0
known 0
anything 0
like 0
it. 0

There 0
is 0
a 0
kind 0
of 0
eerie 1
silence 1
around 0
the 0
Julian 0
Assange 0
case. 0

Julian 0
has 0
been 0
vindicated 0
in 0
every 0
possible 0
way 0
and 0
yet 0
he 0
is 0
isolated 0
as 0
few 0
people 0
are 0
these 0
days. 0

He 0
is 0
cut 0
off 0
from 0
the 0
very 0
tools 0
of 0
his 0
trade, 0
visitors 0
aren’t 0
allowed. 0

I 0
was 0
in 0
London 0
recently 0
and 0
I 0
couldn’t 0
see 0
him, 0
although 0
I 0
spoke 0
to 0
people 0
who 0
had 0
seen 0
him. 0

Rafael 0
Correa, 0
the 0
former 0
president 0
of 0
Ecuador, 0
said 0
recently 0
that 0
he 1
regarded 1
what 1
they 1
are 1
doing 1
to 1
Julian 1
now 1
as 1
torture. 1

It 0
was 0
Correa’s 0
government 0
that 0
gave 0
Julian 0
political 0
refuge, 0
which 0
has 0
been 0
betrayed 0
now 0
by 0
his 0
successor, 0
the 0
government 0
led 0
by 0
Lenin 0
Moreno, 0
which 0
is 0
back 0
to 0
sucking 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
United 1
States 1
in 1
the 1
time-honored 1
way, 1
with 0
Julian 0
as 0
the 0
pawn 0
and 0
victim. 0

Should 0
be 0
a 1
‘Constitutional 1
Hero’ 1

But 0
really 0
it 0
comes 0
down 0
to 0
the 0
British 0
government. 0

Although 0
he 0
is 0
still 0
in 0
a 0
foreign 0
embassy 0
and 0
actually 0
has 0
Ecuadorian 0
nationality, 0
his 0
right 0
of 0
passage 0
out 0
of 0
that 0
embassy 0
should 0
be 0
guaranteed 0
by 0
the 0
British 0
government. 0

The 0
United 0
Nations 0
Working 0
Party 0
on 0
Unlawful 0
Detentions 0
has 0
made 0
that 0
clear. 0

Britain 0
took 0
part 0
in 0
an 0
investigation 0
which 0
determined 0
that 0
Julian 0
was 0
a 0
political 0
refugee 0
and 0
that 0
a 1
great 1
miscarriage 1
of 1
justice 1
had 0
been 0
imposed 0
on 0
him. 0

It 0
is 0
very 0
good 0
that 0
you 0
are 0
doing 0
this, 0
Dennis, 0
because 0
even 0
in 0
the 0
media 0
outside 0
the 0
mainstream, 0
there 0
is 0
this 0
silence 0
about 0
Julian. 0

The 0
streets 0
outside 0
the 0
embassy 0
are 1
virtually 1
empty, 1
whereas 0
they 1
should 1
be 1
full 1
of 1
people 1
saying 1
that 1
we 1
are 1
with 1
you. 1

The 0
principles 0
involved 0
in 0
this 0
case 0
are 0
absolutely 1
clear-cut. 1

Number 0
one 0
is 0
justice. 0

The 1
injustice 1
done 1
to 1
this 1
man 1
is 1
legion, 1
both 0
in 0
terms 0
of 0
the 1
bogus 1
Swedish 1
case 1
and 0
now 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
he 0
must 0
remain 0
in 0
the 0
embassy 0
and 0
can’t 0
leave 0
without 0
being 0
arrested, 0
extradited 0
to 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
and 0
ending 1
up 1
in 1
a 1
hell 1
hole. 1

But 1
it 1
is 1
also 1
about 1
freedom 1
of 1
speech, 1
about 1
our 1
right 1
to 1
know, 1
which 1
is 1
enshrined 1
in 1
the 1
United 1
States 1
Constitution. 1

If 0
the 0
Constitution 0
were 0
taken 0
literally, 0
Julian 0
would 0
be 0
a 1
constitutional 1
hero, 1
actually. 0

Instead, 0
I 0
understand 0
the 0
indictment 0
they 0
are 0
trying 0
to 0
concoct 0
reads 0
like 0
a 0
charge 0
of 0
espionage! 0

It’s 1
so 1
ridiculous.That 1
is 0
the 0
situation 0
as 0
I 0
see 0
it, 0
Dennis. 0

It 0
is 0
not 0
a 0
happy 0
one 0
but 0
it 0
is 0
one 0
that 0
people 0
should 0
rally 0
to 0
quickly. 0

DB: 0
His 1
journalistic 1
brethren 1
are 0
sounding 0
like 0
his 0
prosecutors. 0

They 0
want 0
to 0
get 0
behind 0
Russia-gate 1
freaks 1
like 0
Congressman 0
Adam 0
Schiff 0
and 0
Mike 0
Pompeo, 0
who 0
would 0
like 0
to 0
see 0
Assange 0
in 1
jail 1
forever 1
or 1
even 1
executed. 1

How 0
do 0
you 0
respond 0
to 0
journalists 0
acting 0
like 0
prosecutors, 0
some 0
of 0
whom 0
used 0
his 0
material 0
to 0
do 0
stories? 0

This 0
is 0
a 0
terrible 0
time 0
for 0
journalism. 0

JP: 0
You 0
are 0
absolutely 0
right: 0
It 0
is 0
a 0
terrible 0
time 0
for 0
journalism. 0

I 1
have 1
never 1
known 1
anything 1
quite 1
like 1
it 1
in 1
my 1
career. 1

That 0
said, 0
it 0
is 0
not 0
new. 0

There 0
has 0
always 0
been 0
a 0
so-called 0
mainstream 0
which 0
really 0
comes 0
down 0
to 0
great 0
power 0
in 0
media. 0

It 0
has 0
always 0
existed, 0
particularly 0
in 0
the 0
United 0
States. 0

The 0
Pulitzer 0
Prize 0
this 0
year 0
was 0
awarded 0
to 0
The 0
New 0
York 0
Times 0
and 0
The 0
Washington 0
Post 0
for 0
witch-hunting 1
around 1
Russia-gate! 1

They 0
were 0
praised 0
for 0
“how 0
deeply 0
sourced 0
their 0
investigations 0
were.” 0
Their 1
investigations 1
turned 1
up 1
not 1
a 1
shred 1
of 1
real 1
evidence 1
to 0
suggest 0
any 0
serious 0
Russian 0
intervention 0
in 0
the 0
2016 0
election. 0

Like 0
Webb 0

The 0
Julian 0
Assange 0
case 0
reminds 0
me 0
of 0
the 0
Gary 0
Webb 0
case. 0

Bob 0
Parry 0
was 0
one 0
of 0
Gary 0
Webb’s 0
few 0
supporters 0
in 0
the 0
media. 0

Webb’s 0
“Dark 0
Alliance” 0
series 0
contained 0
evidence 0
that 0
cocaine 0
trafficking 0
was 0
going 0
on 0
with 0
the 0
connivance 0
of 0
the 0
CIA. 0

Later 0
Webb 0
was 1
hounded 1
by 0
fellow 0
journalists 0
and, 0
unable 0
to 0
find 0
work, 0
he 0
eventually 0
committed 0
suicide. 0

The 0
CIA 0
Inspector 0
General 0
subsequently 0
vindicated 0
him. 0

Now, 0
Julian 0
Assange 0
is 0
a 0
long 0
way 0
from 0
taking 0
his 0
own 0
life. 0

His 0
resilience 0
is 0
remarkable. 0

But 0
he 0
is 0
still 0
a 0
human 0
being 0
and 0
he 0
has 0
taken 1
such 1
a 1
battering. 1

Probably 0
the 0
hardest 0
thing 0
for 0
him 0
to 0
take 0
is 0
the 1
utter 1
hypocrisy 1
of 1
news 1
organizations—like 1
The 0
New 0
York 0
Times, 0
which 0
published 0
the 0
WikiLeaks 0
“War 0
Logs” 0
and 0
“Cablegate,” 0
The 0
Washington 0
Post 0
and 0
The 0
Guardian, 0
which 0
has 0
taken 0
a 1
vindictive 1
delight 1
in 1
tormenting 1
Julian. 1

The 0
Guardian 0
a 0
few 0
years 0
ago 0
got 0
a 0
Pulitzer 0
Prize 0
writing 0
about 0
Snowden. 0

But 0
their 0
coverage 0
of 0
Snowden 0
left 0
him 0
in 0
Hong 0
Kong. 0

It 0
was 0
WikiLeaks 0
that 0
got 0
Snowden 0
out 0
of 0
Hong 0
Kong 0
and 0
to 0
safety. 0

Professionally, 0
I 1
find 1
this 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
unsavory 1
and 1
immoral 1
things 1
I 1
have 1
seen 1
in 1
my 1
career. 1

The 0
persecution 0
of 0
this 0
man 0
by 0
huge 0
media 0
organizations 0
which 0
have 0
drawn 0
great 0
benefit 0
from 0
WikiLeaks. 0

One 1
of 1
Assange’s 1
great 1
tormentors, 1
The 1
Guardian‘s 1
Luke 1
Harding, 1
made 0
a 0
great 0
deal 0
of 0
money 0
with 0
a 0
Hollywood 0
version 0
of 0
a 0
book 0
that 0
he 0
and 0
David 0
Lee 0
wrote 0
in 0
which 0
they 0
basically 0
attacked 0
their 0
source. 0

I 0
suppose 0
you 0
have 0
to 0
be 0
a 0
psychiatrist 0
to 0
understand 0
all 0
of 0
this. 0

My 0
understanding 0
is 0
that 0
so 0
many 0
of 0
these 0
journalists 0
are 0
shamed. 0

They 0
realize 0
that 0
WikiLeaks 0
has 0
done 0
what 0
they 0
should 0
have 0
done 0
a 0
long 0
time 0
ago, 0
and 0
that 0
is 0
to 0
tell 0
us 0
how 0
governments 0
lie. 0

DB: 0
One 0
thing 0
that 0
disturbs 0
me 0
greatly 0
is 0
the 0
way 0
in 0
which 0
the 0
Western 0
corporate 0
press 0
speculate 0
about 0
Russian 0
involvement 0
in 0
the 0
U.S. 0
2016 0
election, 0
that 0
it 1
was 1
a 1
hack 1
through 1
Julian 1
Assange. 1

Any 0
serious 0
investigator 0
would 0
want 0
to 0
know 0
who 0
would 0
be 0
motivated. 0

And 0
yet 0
the 0
possibility 0
that 0
it 0
might 0
be 0
the 1
dozen 1
or 1
so 1
pissed-off 1
people 1
who 0
went 0
to 0
work 0
for 0
the 1
Clinton 1
machine 1
and 0
learned 0
from 0
the 0
inside 0
that 0
the 0
DNC 0
was 0
all 0
about 0
getting 0
rid 0
of 0
Bernie 0
Sanders…this 0
is 0
not 0
a 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
story! 0

Eight 0
Hundred 0
Thousand 0
Disclosures 0
on 0
Russia 0

JP: 0
What 0
happened 0
to 0
Sanders 0
and 0
the 0
way 0
that 0
he 1
was 1
rolled 1
by 1
the 1
Clinton 1
organization, 1
everybody 0
knows 0
that 0
this 0
is 0
the 0
story. 0

And 0
now 0
we 0
have 0
the 0
DNC 0
suing 0
WikiLeaks! 0

There’s 0
a 0
kind 0
of 0
farcical 1
element 1
to 0
this. 0

I 0
mean, 0
none 0
of 0
this 0
came 0
from 0
the 0
Russians. 0

That 0
WikiLeaks 0
is 0
somehow 0
in 1
bed 1
with 1
the 1
Russians 1
is 1
ludicrous. 1

WikiLeaks 0
published 0
about 0
800,000 0
major 0
disclosures 0
about 0
Russia, 0
some 0
of 0
them 0
extremely 1
critical 1
of 0
the 0
Russian 0
government. 0

If 0
you 0
are 0
a 0
government 0
and 0
you 0
are 0
doing 0
something 0
untoward 0
or 0
you 0
are 0
lying 0
to 0
your 0
people 0
and 0
WikiLeaks 0
gets 0
the 0
documents 0
to 0
show 0
it, 0
they 0
will 0
publish 0
no 0
matter 0
who 0
you 0
are, 0
be 0
they 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
or 0
Russia. 0

DB: 0
Randy 0
Credico, 0
because 0
of 0
his 0
work 0
and 0
his 0
decision 0
to 0
devote 0
a 0
very 0
high-profile 0
series 0
to 0
the 0
persecution 0
of 0
Julian 0
Assange, 0
recently 0
found 0
himself 0
under 0
attack. 0

He 0
went 0
to 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
Press 0
Roast 0
and, 0
after 0
having 0
a 0
nice 0
discussion 0
with 0
Congressman 0
Schiff, 0
he 1
yelled 1
out 1
“What 0
about 0
Julian 0
Assange?” 0
The 0
room 0
was 0
packed 0
full 0
of 0
reporters 0
but 0
Randy 0
was 0
attacked 0
and 0
dragged 0
out. 0

It 0
was 0
if 0
everyone 0
there 0
was 0
embarrassed 0
to 0
recognize 0
that 0
one 1
of 1
their 1
brethren 1
was 1
being 1
brutalized. 1

JP: 0
Randy 0
shouted 0
some 0
truth. 0

It 0
is 0
very 0
similar 0
to 0
what 0
happened 0
to 0
Ray 0
McGovern. 0

Ray 0
is 0
a 0
former 0
member 0
of 0
the 0
CIA 0
but 0
extremely 0
principled. 0

I 0
might 0
suggest 0
he 1
is 1
a 1
renegade 1
now. 0

DB: 0
It 1
was 1
hysterical 1
to 0
watch 0
these 0
four 0
armed 0
guards 0
who 0
kept 0
shouting 0
“Stop 0
resisting, 0
stop 0
resisting!” 0
and 0
they 0
are 0
beating 1
the 1
hell 1
out 1
of 1
him! 1

JP: 0
I 0
thought 0
the 0
image 0
of 0
Ray 0
being 1
hauled 1
off 1
was 0
particularly 0
telling. 0

These 1
four 1
overweight, 1
obviously 1
ill-trained 1
young 1
men 1
manhandling 1
Ray, 0
who 0
is 0
78 0
years 0
old. 0

There 0
was 0
something 0
highly 0
emblematic 0
about 0
that 0
for 0
me. 0

He 0
stood 0
up 0
to 0
challenge 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
the 0
CIA 0
was 0
about 0
to 0
hand 0
over 0
leadership 0
to 0
a 0
person 0
who 0
had 0
been 0
in 0
charge 0
of 0
torture. 0

It 0
is 0
both 1
shocking 1
and 1
surreal, 1
which 0
of 0
course 0
the 0
Julian 0
Assange 0
case 0
is 0
as 0
well. 0

But 0
real 0
journalism 0
should 0
be 0
able 0
to 0
get 0
through 0
the 1
shocking 1
and 1
the 1
surreal 1
and 0
get 0
to 0
the 0
truth. 0

There 0
is 0
so 0
much 0
collusion 0
now, 0
with 0
all 0
these 0
dark 1
and 1
menacing 1
developments. 1

It 0
is 0
almost 0
as 0
if 0
the 1
word 1
“journalism” 1
is 1
becoming 1
blighted. 1

DB: 0
There 0
has 0
certainly 0
been 0
a 0
lot 0
of 0
collusion 0
when 0
it 0
comes 0
to 0
Israel. 0

Then 0
the 0
word 0
“collusion” 0
is 0
quite 0
appropriate. 0

JP:That’s 0
the 0
ultimate 0
collusion. 0

But 0
that’s 0
collusion 1
with 0
silence. 0

Never 1
has 1
there 1
been 1
a 1
collusion 1
like 1
the 1
one 1
between 1
the 1
U.S. 1
and 1
Israel. 1

It 0
suggests 0
another 0
word 0
and 0
that 0
is 0
“immunity.” 0
It 0
has 0
a 0
moral 0
immunity, 0
a 0
cultural 0
immunity, 0
a 0
geopolitical 0
immunity, 0
a 0
legal 0
immunity, 0
and 0
certainly 0
a 0
media 0
immunity. 1

We 0
see 0
the 0
gunning 1
down 1
of 0
over 0
60 0
people 0
on 0
the 0
day 0
of 0
the 0
inauguration 0
of 0
the 0
new 0
U.S. 0
embassy 0
in 0
Jerusalem. 0

Israel 0
has 0
some 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
wickedly 1
experimental 1
munitions 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
and 0
they 0
fired 0
them 0
at 0
people 0
who 0
were 0
protesting 0
the 0
occupation 0
of 0
their 0
homeland 0
and 0
trying 0
to 0
remind 0
people 0
of 0
the 0
Nakba 0
and 0
the 0
right 0
of 0
return. 0

In 0
the 0
media 0
these 0
were 0
described 0
as 0
“clashes.” 0
Although 0
they 0
did 0
become 0
so 0
bad 0
that 0
The 0
New 0
York 0
Times 0
in 0
a 0
later 0
edition 0
changed 0
its 0
front 0
page 0
headline 0
to 0
say 0
that 0
Israel 0
was 0
actually 0
killing 0
people. 0

A 0
rare 0
moment, 0
indeed, 0
when 0
the 0
immunity, 0
the 0
collusion 0
was 0
interrupted. 0

All 1
the 1
talk 1
of 1
Iran 1
and 1
nuclear 1
weapons 1
is 1
without 1
any 1
reference 1
to 1
the 1
biggest 1
nuclear 1
power 1
in 1
the 1
Middle 1
East. 1

DB: 0
What 0
would 0
you 0
say 0
have 0
been 0
the 0
contributions 0
that 0
Julian 0
Assange 0
has 0
made 0
in 0
this 0
age 0
of 0
censorship 0
and 0
cowardice 1
in 1
journalism? 1

Where 0
does 0
he 0
come 0
into 0
the 0
picture? 0

JP:I 0
think 0
it 0
comes 0
down 0
to 0
information. 0

If 0
you 0
go 0
back 0
to 0
when 0
WikiLeaks 0
started, 0
when 0
Julian 0
was 0
sitting 0
in 0
his 0
hotel 0
room 0
in 0
Paris 0
beginning 0
to 0
put 0
the 0
whole 0
thing 0
together, 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
first 0
things 0
he 0
wrote 0
was 0
that 0
there 0
is 0
a 0
morality 0
in 0
transparency, 0
that 0
we 0
have 0
a 0
right 0
to 0
know 0
what 0
those 0
who 0
wish 0
to 0
control 0
our 0
lives 0
are 0
doing 0
in 0
secret. 0

The 0
right 0
to 0
know 0
what 0
governments 0
are 0
doing 0
in 0
our 0
name—on 0
our 0
behalf 0
or 0
to 0
our 0
detriment—is 0
our 0
moral 0
right. 0

Julian 0
feels 0
very 0
passionately 0
about 0
this. 0

There 0
were 0
times 0
when 0
he 0
could 0
have 0
compromised 0
slightly 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
possibly 0
help 0
his 0
situation. 0

There 0
were 0
times 0
when 0
I 0
said 0
to 0
him, 0
“Why 0
don’t 0
you 0
just 0
suspend 0
that 0
for 0
a 0
while 0
and 0
go 0
along 0
with 0
it?” 0
Of 0
course, 0
I 0
knew 0
beforehand 0
what 0
his 0
answer 0
would 0
be 0
and 0
that 0
was 0
“no.” 0
The 0
enormous 0
amount 0
of 0
information 0
that 0
has 0
come 0
from 0
WikiLeaks, 0
particularly 0
in 0
recent 0
years, 0
has 0
amounted 0
to 0
an 1
extraordinary 1
public 1
service. 1

I 0
was 0
reading 0
just 0
the 0
other 0
day 0
a 0
2006 0
WikiLeaks 0
cable 0
from 0
the 0
U.S. 0
embassy 0
in 0
Caracas 0
which 0
was 0
addressed 0
to 0
other 0
agencies 0
in 0
the 0
region. 0

This 0
was 0
four 0
years 0
after 0
the 0
U.S. 0
tried 0
to 0
get 0
rid 0
of 0
Chavez 0
in 0
a 0
coup. 0

It 0
detailed 0
how 0
subversion 0
should 0
work. 0

Of 0
course, 0
they 1
dressed 1
it 1
up 1
as 0
human 0
rights 0
work 0
and 0
so 0
on. 0

I 0
was 0
reading 0
this 0
official 0
document 0
thinking 0
how 0
the 0
information 0
contained 0
in 0
it 0
was 0
worth 0
years 0
of 0
the 0
kind 0
of 0
distorted 0
reporting 0
from 0
Venezuela. 0

It 0
also 0
reminds 0
us 0
that 0
so-called 0
“meddling” 0
by 0
Russia 0
in 0
the 0
U.S. 0
is 0
just 0
nonsense. 0

The 0
word 0
“meddling” 0
doesn’t 0
apply 0
to 0
the 0
kind 0
of 0
action 0
implied 0
in 0
this 0
document. 0

It 0
is 0
intervention 0
in 0
another 0
country’s 0
affairs. 0

WikiLeaks 0
has 0
done 0
that 0
all 0
over 0
the 0
world. 0

It 0
has 0
given 0
people 0
the 0
information 0
they 0
have 0
a 0
right 0
to 0
have. 0

They 0
had 0
a 0
right 0
to 0
find 0
out 0
from 0
the 0
so-called 0
“War 0
Logs” 0
the 0
criminality 0
of 0
our 0
wars 0
in 0
Afghanistan 0
and 0
Iraq. 0

They 1
had 1
a 1
right 1
to 0
find 0
out 0
about 0
Cablegate. 0

That’s 0
when, 0
on 0
Clinton’s 0
watch, 0
we 0
learned 0
that 0
the 0
NSA 0
was 0
gathering 0
personal 0
information 0
on 0
members 0
of 0
the 0
United 0
Nations 0
Security 0
Council, 0
including 0
their 0
credit 0
card 0
numbers. 0

You 0
can 0
see 0
why 0
Julian 0
made 0
enemies. 0

But 0
he 0
should 0
also 0
have 0
made 0
a 0
huge 0
number 0
of 0
friends. 0

This 0
is 0
critical 0
information 0
because 0
it 0
tells 0
us 0
how 0
power 0
works 0
and 0
we 0
will 0
never 0
learn 0
about 0
it 0
otherwise. 0

I 0
think 0
WikiLeaks 0
has 0
opened 0
a 0
world 0
of 0
transparency 0
and 1
put 1
flesh 1
on 1
the 1
expression 1
“right 0
to 0
know.” 0
This 0
must 0
explain 0
why 0
he 0
is 0
attacked 0
so 0
much, 0
because 0
that 0
is 0
so 0
threatening. 0

The 1
enemy 1
to 1
great 1
power 1
is 1
not 1
the 1
likes 1
of 1
the 1
Taliban, 1
it 1
is 1
us. 1

DB: 0
And 0
who 0
can 0
forget 0
the 0
release 0
of 0
the 0
“collateral 0
murder” 0
footage 0
by 0
Chelsea 0
Manning? 0

JP: 0
That 0
kind 0
of 0
thing 0
is 0
not 0
uncommon. 0

Vietnam 0
was 0
meant 0
to 0
be 0
the 0
open 0
war 0
but 0
really 0
it 0
wasn’t. 0

There 0
weren’t 0
the 0
cameras 0
around. 0

It 0
is 0
indeed 0
shocking 1
information 1
but 0
it 0
informs 0
people, 0
and 0
we 0
have 0
Chelsea 0
Manning’s 0
courage 0
to 0
thank 0
for 0
that. 0

DB: 0
Yes, 0
and 0
the 0
thanks 0
he 0
got 0
was 0
seven 0
years 0
in 0
solitary 0
confinement. 0

They 0
want 0
to 0
prosecute 0
Assange 0
and 0
maybe 0
hang 1
him 1
from 1
the 1
rafters 1
in 0
Congress, 0
but 1
what 1
about 1
Judith 1
Miller 1
and 1
The 1
New 1
York 1
Times 1
lying 1
the 1
West 1
into 1
war? 1

There 0
is 0
no 0
end 0
of 0
horrific 1
examples 1
of 0
what 0
passes 0
for 0
journalism, 0
in 0
contrast 0
to 0
the 0
amazing 0
contribution 0
that 0
Julian 0
Assange 0
has 0
made. 0
