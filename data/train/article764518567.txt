General 0
Michael 0
E. 0
Horowitz 0
has 0
released 0
his 0
500 0
plus-page 0
report, 0
which 0
purports 0
to 0
shine 0
a 0
light 0
on 0
the 0
mishandling 0
at 0
top 0
levels 0
of 0
the 0

she 0
served 0
as 0

Such 0

The 0
report 0
from 0
the 0
Department 0
of 0
Justice’s 0
Office 0
of 0
the 0
Inspector 0
General 0
(“OIG”) 0
criticized 0
certain 0
actions 0
and 0
decisions 0
of 0
former 0
FBI 0
Director 0
James 0
Comey, 0
together 0
with 0
those 0
of 0

who 0
were 0
involved 0
in 0
the 0
probe, 0
including 0
former 0
Deputy 0
FBI 0
Director 0
Andrew 0
McCabe. 0

Mr. 0
McCabe 0
is 0
already 0
the 0
subject 0
of 0
an 0
earlier 0
criminal 0
referral 0
from 0
the 0
OIG 0
for 0
his 0
alleged 0

Lisa 0
Page, 0
an 0
attorney 0
who 0
has 0
since 0
left 0
the 0
FBI, 0
were 0
targeted 0
in 0
this 0
report 0
for 0
their 0
blatantly 1
anti-Trump 1
text 0
messages. 0

Former 0
Attorney 0
General 0
Loretta 0
Lynch 0
was 0
also 0
criticized 0
for 0
exercising 0
bad 0
judgment 0
in 0
connection 0
with 0
her 0
infamous 1
tarmac 0
meeting 0
with 0
Bill 0
Clinton. 0

Mr. 0
Horowitz’s 0
report 0
focused 0
on 0
process 0
and 0
procedures. 0

The 0
inspector 0
general 0
made 0
clear 0
when 0
he 0
launched 0
his 0
investigation 0
in 0
January 0
2017 0
that 0
“his 0
review 0
will 0
not 0
substitute 0
the 0
OIG's 0
judgment 0
for 0
the 0
judgments 0
made 0
by 0
the 0
FBI 0
or 0
the 0
Department 0
regarding 0
the 0
substantive 0
merits 0
of 0
investigative 0
or 0
prosecutive 0
decisions." 0

Moreover, 0
this 0
report 0
did 0
not 0
address 0
whether 0
the 0
Department 0
of 0
Justice 0
or 0
FBI 0
abused 0
the 0
Foreign 0
Intelligence 0
Surveillance 0
Act 0
to 0
obtain 0
a 0
surveillance 0
order 0
against 0
former 0
Trump 0
campaign 0
advisor 0
Carter 0
Page, 0
or 0
the 0
government’s 0
reliance 0
on 0
former 0
British 0
intelligence 0
agent 0
Christopher 0
Steele’s 0
salacious 1
and 0
unverified 0
“dossier” 0
in 0
its 0
FISA 0
court 0
application, 0
which 0
the 0
OIG 0
is 0
investigating 0
separately. 0

In 0
analyzing 0
the 0
highly 0
anticipated 0
OIG 0
report’s 0
conclusions, 0
it 0
is 0
clear 0
that 0
either 0
Mr. 0
Horowitz 0
himself 0
decided 0
to 0
pull 0
his 0
punches 0
or 0
that 0
the 0
final 0
version, 0
which 0
had 0
been 0
reviewed 0
by 0
upper 0
echelons 0
in 0
both 0
the 0
FBI 0
and 0
Justice 0
Department 0
before 0
its 0
public 0
release, 0
emerged 1
in 1
a 1
disappointingly 1
watered-down 1
form. 1

To 0
be 0
sure, 0
the 0
report 0
faulted 0
Comey 0
for 0
deviating 0
from 0
FBI 0
and 0
Justice 0
Department 0
procedures 0
in 0
handling 0
the 0
probe 0
into 0
Hillary 0
Clinton’s 0
use 0
of 0
a 0
private 0
e-mail 0
server 0
while 0
she 0
served 0
as 0
Secretary 0
of 0
State, 0
thereby 0
negatively 0
impacting 0
“the 0
perception 0
of 0
the 0
FBI 0
and 0
the 0
department 0
as 0
fair 0
administrators 0
of 0
justice.” 0
Comey, 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
OIG 0
report, 0
“engaged 0
in 0
ad 0
hoc 0
decision 0
making 0
based 0
on 0
his 0
personal 0
views 0
even 0
if 0
it 0
meant 0
rejecting 0
longstanding 0
Department 0
policy 0
or 0
practice.” 0

Starting 0
with 0
Comey’s 0
public 0
announcement 0
on 0
July 0
5, 0
2016 0
criticizing 0
Hillary 0
Clinton 0
and 0
her 0
staff 0
for 0
being 0
“extremely 1
careless 1
in 0
their 0
handling 0
of 0
very 0
sensitive, 0
highly 0
classified 0
information,” 0
but 0
also 0
announcing 0
that 0
the 0
FBI 0
was 0
“expressing 0
to 0
Justice 0
our 0
view 0
that 0
no 0
charges 0
are 0
appropriate 0
in 0
this 0
case,” 0
Comey 0
was 0
taken 0
to 0
task 0
for 0
insubordination 0
and 0
usurping 0
the 0
authority 0
of 0
the 0
attorney 0
general. 0

He 0
“upset 0
the 0
well-established 0
separation 0
between 0
investigative 0
and 0
prosecutorial 0
functions,” 0
the 0
report 0
said. 0

Comey’s 0
follow-up 0
letters 0
to 0
Congress 0
on 0
October 0
28 0
and 0
November 0
6, 0
2016 0
were 0
similarly 0
criticized. 0

The 0
first 0
letter 0
informed 0
Congress 0
that 0
agents 0
were 0
reopening 0
their 0
probe 0
into 0
Clinton’s 0
handling 0
of 0
classified 0
material 0
after 0
discovering 0
her 0
e-mails 0
on 0
the 0
laptop 0
of 0
Andrew 0
Weiner, 0
the 0
husband 0
of 0
Clinton’s 0
top 0
aide 0
Huma 0
Abedin. 0

This 0
letter 0
was 0
followed 0
on 0
November 0
6, 0
2016 0
by 0
Comey’s 0
statement 0
that 0
the 0
review 0
of 0
the 0
additional 0
information 0
had 0
been 0
completed 0
and 0
that 0
the 0
FBI 0
remained 0
convinced 0
that 0
charges 0
were 0
not 0
appropriate. 0

Comey 0
acted 0
against 0
the 0
advice 0
of 0
senior 0
Justice 0
Department 0
officials 0
in 0
making 0
these 0
disclosures 0
the 0
way 0
he 0
did. 0

The 0
OIG 0
report 0
was 0
highly 0
critical 0
of 0
the 0
FBI’s 0
failure 0
to 0
take 0
immediate 0
action 0
on 0
the 0
Weiner 0
laptop 0
when 0
they 0
first 0
learned 0
about 0
it 0
in 0
late 0
September 0
2016, 0
rather 0
than 0
waiting 0
another 0
month 0
so 0
close 0
to 0
the 0
election. 0

The 0
criticisms 0
of 0
Comey's 0
undisciplined 0
behavior 0
was 0
all 0
well 0
and 0
good, 0
but 0
it 0
was 0
reasonable 0
to 0
expect 0
something 0
more 0
than 0
the 0
equivalent 0
of 0
a 0
departmental 0
employee 0
review 0
after 0
nearly 0
a 0
year 0
and 0
a 0
half 0
of 0
investigation. 0

Hillary 0
Clinton’s 0
supporters 0
will 0
no 0
doubt 0
jump 0
on 0
the 0
inspector 0
general’s 0
criticisms 0
of 0
Comey’s 0
handling 0
of 0
the 0
July 0
5th 0
announcement 0
and 0
subsequent 0
letters 0
as 0
proof 0
that 0
he 0
improperly 0
influenced 0
the 0
outcome 0
of 0
the 0
election 0
in 0
President 0
Trump’s 0
favor, 0
even 0
if 0
he 0
did 0
not 0
do 0
so 0
deliberately 0
for 0
political 0
reasons. 0

However, 0
what 0
Comey 0
really 0
did 0
was 0
to 0
give 1
Hillary 1
Clinton 1
a 1
Get 1
Out 1
of 1
Jail 1
Free 1
card. 1

The 0
fix 0
was 0
in 0
as 0
early 0
as 0
May 0
2016, 0
well 0
before 0
the 0
FBI 0
interviews 0
of 0
Hillary 0
Clinton 0
and 0
of 0
as 0
many 0
as 0
17 0
other 0
key 0
witnesses, 0
when 0
Comey 0
began 0
the 0
process 0
of 0
drafting 0
an 0
exoneration 0
memo. 0

Comey’s 0
initial 0
draft 0
statement, 0
which 0
he 0
shared 0
with 0
FBI 0
senior 0
leadership 0
on 0
May 0
2, 0
criticized 0
Clinton’s 0
handling 0
of 0
classified 0
information 0
as 0
“grossly 1
negligent,” 1
but 0
concluded 0
that 0
“no 0
reasonable 0
prosecutor” 0
would 0
bring 0
a 0
case 0
based 0
on 0
the 0
facts 0
developed 0
in 0
the 0
investigation. 0

Indeed, 0
Comey 0
admitted 0
in 0
his 0
book 0
that 0
“we 0
started 0
the 0
Clinton 0
investigation 0
aware 0
that 0
it 0
was 0
unlikely 0
to 0
be 0
a 0
case 0
that 0
career 0
prosecutors 0
at 0
the 0
Department 0
of 0
Justice 0
would 0
prosecute.” 0

If 0
putting 0
the 0
cart 0
of 0
exoneration 0
before 0
the 0
horse 0
of 0
investigation 0
were 0
not 0
enough, 0
Comey’s 0
draft 0
statement 0
underwent 0
various 0
language 0
changes 0
over 0
the 0
course 0
of 0
the 0
next 0
two 0
months, 0
including, 0
most 0
importantly, 0
changing 0
the 0
description 0
of 0
Clinton’s 0
handling 0
of 0
classified 0
information 0
from 0
“grossly 1
negligent” 1
to 0
“extremely 1
careless.” 1
This 0
change 0
was 0
critical 0
because 0
“gross 1
negligence” 1
is 0
specifically 0
the 0
legal 0
term 0
used 0
in 0
stating 0
the 0
statutory 0
requirement 0
in 0
18 0
U.S. 0
Code 0
§ 0
793(f) 0
for 0
a 0
finding 0
of 0
criminal 0
conduct. 0

Comey’s 0
substitution 0
of 0
a 0
legally 0
meaningless 0
phrase, 0
“extremely 1
careless,” 1
for 0
the 0
“gross 1
negligence” 1
statutory 0
legal 0
standard 0
he 0
had 0
originally 0
used, 0
had 0
the 0
effect 0
of 0
prejudging 0
the 0
facts 0
in 0
Hillary 0
Clinton’s 0
favor. 0

Andrew 0
McCabe, 0
Peter 0
Strzok 0
and 0
Lisa 0
Page 0
were 0
involved 0
in 0
the 0
edits. 0

Inspector 0
General 0
Horowitz 0
saw 0
no 0
problem 0
with 0
this 0
pattern 0
of 0
obfuscation 0
regarding 0
the 0
deletion 0
of 0
the 0
legally 0
significant 0
phrase 0
“gross 1
negligence” 1
from 0
Comey’s 0
statement. 0

Mr. 0
Horowitz 0
relied 0
in 0
part 0
on 0
opinions 0
from 0
prosecutors 0
that 0
there 0
was 0
not 0
enough 0
evidence 0
to 0
charge 0
Clinton 0
with 0
acting 0
in 0
a 0
manner 0
that 0
rose 0
to 0
a 0
level 0
of 0
criminal 0
gross 1
negligence 1
with 0
respect 0
to 0
sending 0
or 0
receiving 0
e-mails 0
determined 0
to 0
contain 0
classified 0
information. 0

Mr. 0
Horowitz’s 0
report 0
thus 0
concluded, 0
“We 0
did 0
not 0
identify 0
evidence 0
of 0
bias 0
or 0
improper 0
considerations.” 0
This 0
conclusion 0
defies 0
common 0
sense. 0

Gross 1
negligence 1
is 0
not 0
the 0
same 0
as 0
willful 0
intent, 0
which 0
Comey 0
and 0
his 0
team 0
sought 0
to 0
conflate 0
in 0
exonerating 0
Hillary 0
Clinton 0
before 0
the 0
investigation 0
was 0
concluded. 0

Clinton 0
was 0
fully 0
aware 0
of 0
what 0
she 0
was 0
doing 0
when 0
she 0
set 0
up 0
the 0
private 0
server 0
arrangement 0
in 0
the 0
first 0
place 0
and 0
knowingly 0
used 0
it 0
to 0
send 0
and 0
receive 0
e-mails 0
involving 0
official 0
government 0
business, 0
which 0
by 0
their 0
very 0
nature 0
would 0
be 0
expected 0
to 0
include 0
classified 0
information. 0

It 0
turns 0
out 0
that 0
some 0
of 0
the 0
e-mails 0
were 0
accessed 0
by 0
foreign 0
parties. 0

Hillary 0
lied 0
repeatedly 0
when 0
she 0
first 0
denied 0
there 0
were 0
any 0
classified 0
e-mails 0
on 0
her 0
system 0
and 0
then 0
described 0
some 0
of 0
the 0
e-mails 0
involved 0
in 0
the 0
investigation 0
as 0
having 0
been 0
classified 0
after 0
the 0
fact. 0

As 0
Comey 0
has 0
admitted, 0
several 0
e-mail 0
chains 0
concerned 0
matters 0
that 0
were 0
classified 0
at 0
the 0
Top 0
Secret/Special 0
Access 0
Program 0
level 0
when 0
they 0
were 0
sent 0
and 0
received 0
by 0
Clinton. 0

Coupled 0
with 0
her 0
agents’ 0
destruction 0
of 0
thousands 0
of 0
e-mails 0
that 0
had 0
been 0
subpoenaed 0
by 0
Congress, 0
Hillary’s 0
conduct 0
was 0
criminally 1
reckless 1
at 0
the 0
very 0
least, 0
if 0
not 0
constituting 0
willful 1
intent 1
to 1
commit 1
an 1
act 1
she 1
knew 1
was 1
wrongful. 1

Yet 0
Mr. 0
Horowitz 0
saw 0
no 0
reason 0
to 0
doubt 0
the 0
sincerity 0
of 0
Comey's 0
explanations 0
for 0
giving 0
Hillary 0
a 0
free 0
pass. 0

The 0
failure 0
to 0
at 0
least 0
empanel 0
a 0
grand 0
jury 0
to 0
compel 0
testimony 0
from 0
Hillary 0
Clinton 0
and 0
key 0
witnesses 0
was 0
itself 0
a 0
complete 0
dereliction 0
of 0
duty, 0
which 0
could 0
have 0
only 0
been 0
motivated 0
by 0
a 0
desire 0
to 0
treat 1
Hillary 1
Clinton 1
with 1
kid 1
gloves 1
for 0
improper 0
reasons. 0

Incredibly, 0
however, 0
Mr. 0
Horowitz’s 0
report 0
“found 0
no 0
persuasive 0
evidence… 0
that 0
the 0
outcome 0
of 0
the 0
investigation 0
would 0
have 0
been 0
different 0
had 0
Clinton 0
been 0
subpoenaed 0
before 0
the 0
grand 0
jury.” 0

Mr. 0
Horowitz 0
also 0
did 0
not 0
deem 0
Comey’s 0
possible 0
perjury 0
in 0
his 0
testimony 0
before 0
Congress 0
to 0
be 0
an 0
appropriate 0
subject 0
for 0
criminal 0
referral. 0

Comey 0
testified 0
that 0
his 0
decision 0
to 0
exonerate 0
Hillary 0
was 0
not 0
made 0
before 0
her 0
interview 0
took 0
place, 0
when 0
for 0
all 0
intents 0
and 0
purposes 0
it 0
was. 0

Mr. 0
Horowitz 0
simply 0
took 0
Comey’s 0
word 0
for 0
what 0
he 0
had 0
meant. 0

Inspector 0
General 0
Horowitz 0
again 0
emphasized 0
form 0
and 0
process 0
over 0
substance 0
in 0
finding 0
a 0
“troubling 0
lack 0
of 0
any 0
direct, 0
substantive 0
communication” 0
between 0
Comey 0
and 0
Attorney 0
General 0
Lynch 0
ahead 0
of 0
Comey’s 0
July 0
5 0
press 0
conference 0
on 0
Clinton 0
and 0
his 0
October 0
28 0
letter 0
to 0
Congress. 0

Attorney 0
General 0
Lynch’s 0
infamous 1
tarmac 0
meeting 0
with 0
Bill 0
Clinton 0
was 0
discussed 0
in 0
the 0
report, 0
but 0
mostly 0
in 0
the 0
context 0
of 0
how 0
it 0
affected 0
Comey’s 0
decision 0
to 0
go 0
rogue, 0
so 0
to 0
speak, 0
in 0
making 0
his 0
July 0
5th 0
announcement 0
without 0
prior 0
approval 0
from 0
the 0
Justice 0
Department. 0

As 0
to 0
the 0
substance 0
of 0
Ms. 0
Lynch’s 0
decision 0
to 0
meet 0
with 0
Bill 0
Clinton 0
at 0
all 0
before 0
his 0
wife’s 0
FBI 0
interview, 0
all 0
Mr. 0
Horowitz’s 0
report 0
had 0
to 0
say 0
was 0
that 0
it 0
was 0
“an 0
error 0
in 0
judgment.” 0

The 0
OIG 0
report 0
also 0
criticized 0
the 0
conduct 0
of 0
Peter 0
Strzok 0
and 0
Lisa 0
Page, 0
who 0
had 0
exchanged 0
text 0
messages 0
sharply 1
critical 1
of 1
Mr. 1
Trump 1
before 0
and 0
after 0
the 0
election, 0
for 0
casting 0
“a 0
cloud 0
over 0
the 0
entire 0

Mr. 0
Horowitz 0
wrote 0
that 0
this 0
exchange 0
was 0
“not 0
only 0
indicative 0
of 0

however, 0

concluded 1
that 0
there 0

no 0
