On 0

tweeted 0

According 0

many 0

that 0
that’s 0
probably 0
because 0
the 1

feels 1
like 1
it’s 1
worth 1

Millions 0
of 0
residents 0
still 0
don’t 0
have 0
access 0
to 0
electricity 0
or 0
proper 0
health 0
care, 0
and 0
bacteria 0
in 0
the 0
water 0
have 0
exposed 0
many 0
people 0
to 0
disease. 0

And 0
calls 0
for 0
help 0
have 0
gone 0
unanswered 0
besides 0
the 0
few 0
willing 0
to 0
travel 0
to 0
the 0
devastated 1
island 0
privately. 0

Senator 0
Martin 0
Heinrich 0
(D-NM) 0
along 0
with 0
a 0
handful 0
of 0
other 0
lawmakers 0
are 0
calling 0
on 0
the 0
federal 0
government 0
to 0
continue 0
to 0
provide 0
aid 0
to 0
the 1
post-apocalyptic 1
ravaged 1
territory. 1

“Even 0
before 0
Hurricanes 0
Irma 0
and 0
Maria 0
hit 0
the 0
U.S. 0
territories, 0
the 0
islands’ 0
health 0
care 0
system 0
was 0
suffering 0
from 0
the 0
ongoing 0
economic 0
crisis. 0

The 1
islands 1
are 1
grappling 1
with 1
physician 1
shortages, 1
Medicaid 1
programs 1
facing 1
an 1
impending 1
funding 1
cliff, 1
and 1
widespread 1
disparities 1
in 1
Federal 1
health 1
programs—and 1
that 1
was 1
before 1
hurricane 1
season,” 1
the 0
lawmakers 0
stated 0
in 0
a 0
letter. 0

“We 0
are 0
grateful 0
for 0
the 0
public 0
health 0
emergency 0
declaration 0
in 0
Puerto 0
Rico 0
and 0
the 0
U.S. 0
Virgin 0
Islands, 0
but 1
more 1
can 1
and 1
should 1
be 1
done 1
to 1
help 1
Americans 1
impacted 1
by 1
these 1
disasters.” 1

The 0
senators 0
stressed 0
that 0
much 0
of 0
the 0
islands’ 0
power 0
and 0
communication 0
networks 0
are 0
out 0
and, 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
Federal 0
Emergency 0
Management 0
Agency 0
(FEMA), 0
it 0
will 0
take 0
months 0
before 0
power 0
is 0
fully 0
restored. 0

Hospitals 0
have 0
been 0
forced 0
to 0
prioritize 0
patients, 0
ration 0
services, 0
and 0
forgo 0
elective 0
surgeries. 0

The 0
power 0
grid’s 0
failure 0
has 0
caused 0
more 0
problems 0
than 0
many 0
anticipated, 0
like 0
the 0
stall 0
of 0
relief 0
efforts. 0

Without 0
electricity, 0
communications 0
are 0
non-existent 0
too. 0

Some 0
33 0
days 0
after 0
Hurricane 0
Maria 0
made 0
landfall 0
on 0
Puerto 0
Rico, 0
only 0
23 0
percent 0
of 0
residents 0
have 0
electricity, 0
according 0
to 0
Status.pr, 0
which 0
provides 0
daily 0
updates 0
on 0
basic 0
services 0
on 0
the 0
island. 0

While 0
there 0
are 0
still 0
other 0
problems 0
as 0
well, 0
such 0
as 0
gas 0
stations 0
being 0
slow 0
to 0
reopen, 0
and 0
roads 0
getting 0
badly 0
damaged, 0
the 1
power 1
grid’s 1
utter 1
annihilation 1
in 0
the 0
category 0
4 0
winds 0
is 0
not 0
just 0
a 0
temporary 0
inconvenience. 0

The 0
different 0
ways 0
that 0
the 0
lack 0
of 0
electricity 0
can 0
set 0
off 0
a 0
cascade 0
of 0
other 0
crises 0
is 0
becoming 0
increasingly 0
clear. 0

A 0
giant 0
government-owned 0
hospital 0
ship, 0
the 0
USNS 0
Comfort, 0
arrived 0
in 0
Puerto 0
Rico 0
weeks 0
ago 0
to 0
help 0
out, 0
but 0
many 0
people 0
don’t 0
know 0
about 0
the 0
ship. 0

Without 0
electricity, 0
most 0
cell 0
phone 0
towers 0
are 0
down. 0

But 0
even 0
if 0
communications 0
were 0
working, 0
residents 0
can’t 0
get 0
to 0
the 0
port, 0
as 0
many 0
of 0
the 0
island’s 0
roads 0
are 0
impassable 0
and 0
most 0
are 0
without 0
gasoline 0
to 0
power 0
a 0
car. 0

The 0
ship 0
has 0
extensive 0
space 0
and 0
equipment 0
for 0
trauma 0
care 0
and 0
a 0
large 0
staff, 0
but 0
CNN 0
reported 0
that 0
as 0
of 0
last 0
Tuesday, 0
only 0
33 0
of 0
250 0
beds 0
were 0
full. 0

The 0
looming 1
crisis 1
seems 0
to 0
be 0
getting 0
worse, 0
not 0
better, 0
and 0
Puerto 0
Rico 0
is 0
experiencing 0
a 0
medical 0
crisis 0
of 0
epic 0
proportions. 0
