And 0 41 2
it’s 0 41 2
a 0 41 2

On 0 41 3

a 0 41 3

from 0 41 3

a 0 41 3
hospital, 0 41 3
in 0 41 3

scrubbed-up 0 41 3

According 0 41 4

currently 0 41 4

almost 0 41 4
9,000 0 41 4

and 0 41 4
many 0 41 4
speculate 0 41 4
that 0 41 4
that’s 0 41 4
probably 0 41 4
because 0 41 4
the 1 41 4
blurry 1 41 4

feels 1 41 4
like 1 41 4
it’s 1 41 4
worth 1 41 4
a 1 41 4
good 1 41 4

than 1 41 4
1,000 1 41 4

before 1 41 13

the 0 41 13

a 0 41 13

non-existent 0 41 18

many 0 41 22
people 0 41 22
don’t 0 41 22

even 0 41 24
