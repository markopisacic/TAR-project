Note: 0 31 1
This 0 31 1
is 0 31 1
probably 0 31 1
a 0 31 1
reason 0 31 1
why 0 31 1
reporters 0 31 1
Laura 0 31 1
Loomer 0 31 1
and 0 31 1
Mike 0 31 1
Tokes 0 31 1
were 0 31 1
barred 0 31 1
from 0 31 1
entering 0 31 1
the 0 31 1
presser. 0 31 1

They 0 31 2
would 0 31 2
have 0 31 2
posed 0 31 2
real 0 31 2
genuine 0 31 2
questions 0 31 2
of 0 31 2
Sheriff 0 31 2
Lombardo 0 31 2
and 0 31 2
forced 0 31 2
him 0 31 2
to 0 31 2
stumble 0 31 2
all 0 31 2
over 0 31 2
himself 0 31 2
in 0 31 2
answering 0 31 2
them. 0 31 2

The 0 31 3
words 0 31 3
“conspiracy 1 31 3
theorists” 1 31 3
are 0 31 3
being 0 31 3
bandied 0 31 3
about. 0 31 3

Are 1 31 4
they 1 31 4
for 1 31 4
real? 1 31 4

A 0 31 5
well-coordinated, 0 31 5
meticulously 0 31 5
planned 0 31 5
attack 0 31 5
on 0 31 5
concertgoers 0 31 5
leads 0 31 5
to 0 31 5
the 0 31 5
murder 0 31 5
of 0 31 5
58 0 31 5
Americans 0 31 5
at 0 31 5
a 0 31 5
country 0 31 5
music 0 31 5
festival 0 31 5
in 0 31 5
Las 0 31 5
Vegas, 0 31 5
with 0 31 5
over 0 31 5
500 0 31 5
injured, 0 31 5
and 0 31 5
they 0 31 5
have 0 31 5
no 0 31 5
explanation 0 31 5
or 0 31 5
motive. 0 31 5

Do 1 31 6
the 1 31 6
FBI 1 31 6
and 1 31 6
law 1 31 6
enforcement 1 31 6
think 1 31 6
people 1 31 6
won’t 1 31 6
talk 1 31 6
about 1 31 6
it 1 31 6
or 1 31 6
speculate 1 31 6
as 1 31 6
to 1 31 6
what 1 31 6
happened? 1 31 6

Are 1 31 7
they 1 31 7
for 1 31 7
real? 1 31 7

Further, 1 31 8
the 1 31 8
FBI 1 31 8
insists 1 31 8
there 1 31 8
is 1 31 8
no 1 31 8
jihad 1 31 8
motive, 1 31 8
while 1 31 8
saying 1 31 8
they 1 31 8
don’t 1 31 8
know 1 31 8
his 1 31 8
motive. 1 31 8

How 0 31 9
can 0 31 9
they 0 31 9
possibly 0 31 9
hold 0 31 9
those 0 31 9
two 0 31 9
contradictory 0 31 9
ideas 0 31 9
at 0 31 9
the 0 31 9
same 0 31 9
time? 0 31 9

The 0 31 10
sheriff, 0 31 10
alluding 0 31 10
to 0 31 10
allegations 0 31 10
of 0 31 10
a 0 31 10
conspiracy 0 31 10
between 0 31 10
his 0 31 10
department, 0 31 10
the 0 31 10
F.B.I., 0 31 10
and 0 31 10
MGM 0 31 10
— 0 31 10
supposedly 0 31 10
in 0 31 10
an 0 31 10
effort 0 31 10
to 0 31 10
establish 0 31 10
a 0 31 10
legal 0 31 10
case 0 31 10
— 0 31 10
said, 0 31 10
“there 0 31 10
is 0 31 10
no 0 31 10
conspiracy.” 0 31 10

Police 0 31 13
and 0 31 13
hotel 0 31 13
still 0 31 13
don’t 0 31 13
agree 0 31 13
on 0 31 13
some 0 31 13
details. 0 31 13

I 0 31 14
realize 0 31 14
that 0 31 14
in 0 31 14
the 0 31 14
heat 0 31 14
of 0 31 14
a 0 31 14
shooting, 0 31 14
particularly 0 31 14
a 0 31 14
mass 0 31 14
shooting, 0 31 14
it 0 31 14
may 0 31 14
take 0 31 14
some 0 31 14
time 0 31 14
for 0 31 14
a 0 31 14
precise 0 31 14
timeline 0 31 14
to 0 31 14
develop. 0 31 14

But 0 31 15
it 0 31 15
didn’t 0 31 15
take 0 31 15
very 0 31 15
long 0 31 15
for 0 31 15
the 0 31 15
Las 0 31 15
Vegas 0 31 15
police 0 31 15
to 0 31 15
release 0 31 15
a 0 31 15
precise 0 31 15
timeline. 0 31 15

The 0 31 16
initial 0 31 16
timeline 0 31 16
was 0 31 16
that 0 31 16
Stephen 0 31 16
Paddock’s 0 31 16
shooting 0 31 16
stopped 0 31 16
when, 0 31 16
approximately 0 31 16
6 0 31 16
minutes 0 31 16
after 0 31 16
he 0 31 16
started, 0 31 16
he 0 31 16
was 0 31 16
interrupted 0 31 16
by 0 31 16
a 0 31 16
security 0 31 16
guard 0 31 16
from 0 31 16
the 0 31 16
Mandalay 0 31 16
Bay 0 31 16
hotel. 0 31 16

Paddock 0 31 17
then 0 31 17
turned 0 31 17
his 0 31 17
fire 0 31 17
into 0 31 17
the 0 31 17
hallway, 0 31 17
firing 0 31 17
some 0 31 17
200 0 31 17
bullets, 0 31 17
and 0 31 17
after 0 31 17
that 0 31 17
the 0 31 17
shooting 0 31 17
stopped 0 31 17
as 0 31 17
police 0 31 17
arrived. 0 31 17

That 0 31 18
was 0 31 18
Version 0 31 18

Some 0 31 20
days 0 31 20
later, 0 31 20
the 0 31 20
Las 0 31 20
Vegas 0 31 20
police 0 31 20
backed 0 31 20
away 0 31 20
from 0 31 20
that 0 31 20
timeline, 0 31 20
and 0 31 20
stated 0 31 20
that 0 31 20
the 0 31 20
security 0 31 20
guard 0 31 20
actually 0 31 20
arrived 0 31 20
6 0 31 20
minutes 0 31 20
before 0 31 20
Paddock 0 31 20
started 0 31 20
shooting 0 31 20
into 0 31 20
the 0 31 20
crowd 0 31 20
32 0 31 20
stories 0 31 20
below 0 31 20
him. 0 31 20

That 1 31 21
raised 1 31 21
a 1 31 21
number 1 31 21
of 1 31 21
question, 1 31 21
including 0 31 21
why 0 31 21
no 0 31 21
one 0 31 21
called 0 31 21
911 0 31 21
after 0 31 21
what 0 31 21
must 0 31 21
have 0 31 21
been 0 31 21
a 0 31 21
loud 0 31 21
volley 0 31 21
of 0 31 21
shots 0 31 21
in 0 31 21
a 0 31 21
hotel 0 31 21
hallway. 0 31 21

That 0 31 22
was 0 31 22
Version 0 31 22
No. 0 31 22

But 0 31 24
now 0 31 24
that 0 31 24

Las 0 31 27
Vegas 0 31 27
police 0 31 27
said 0 31 27
Friday 0 31 27
that 0 31 27
the 0 31 27
gunman 0 31 27
who 0 31 27
opened 0 31 27
fire 0 31 27
on 0 31 27
a 0 31 27
country 0 31 27
music 0 31 27
festival 0 31 27
far 0 31 27
below 0 31 27
his 0 31 27
hotel 0 31 27
suite 0 31 27
did 0 31 27
not 0 31 27
shoot 0 31 27
a 0 31 27
security 0 31 27
guard 0 31 27
six 0 31 27
minutes 0 31 27
before 0 31 27
that 0 31 27
rampage, 0 31 27
contradicting 1 31 27
a 1 31 27
timeline 1 31 27
they 1 31 27
had 1 31 27
offered 1 31 27
earlier 1 31 27
this 1 31 27
week…. 1 31 27

The 0 31 28
confusion 0 31 28
began 0 31 28
Monday 0 31 28
when 0 31 28
police 0 31 28
said 0 31 28
that 0 31 28
the 0 31 28
gunman 0 31 28
fired 0 31 28
at 0 31 28
the 0 31 28
hotel 0 31 28
security 0 31 28
guard, 0 31 28
Jesus 0 31 28
Campos, 0 31 28
six 0 31 28
minutes 0 31 28
before 0 31 28
the 0 31 28
mass 0 31 28
shooting 0 31 28
began, 0 31 28
not 0 31 28
during 0 31 28
the 0 31 28
massacre 0 31 28
as 0 31 28
they 0 31 28
had 0 31 28
said. 0 31 28

Lombardo 0 31 29
also 0 31 29
said 0 31 29
police 0 31 29
had 0 31 29
hunted 0 31 29
for 0 31 29
the 0 31 29
source 0 31 29
of 0 31 29
the 0 31 29
gunfire 0 31 29
and 0 31 29
that 0 31 29
officers 0 31 29
responding 0 31 29
to 0 31 29
the 0 31 29
gunman’s 0 31 29
floor 0 31 29
were 0 31 29
unaware 0 31 29
that 0 31 29
a 0 31 29
guard 0 31 29
was 0 31 29
shot 0 31 29
until 0 31 29
they 0 31 29
arrived 0 31 29
there, 0 31 29
at 0 31 29
which 0 31 29
point 0 31 29
the 0 31 29
shooting 0 31 29
rampage 0 31 29
had 0 31 29
ended. 0 31 29

MGM 0 31 30
Resorts 0 31 30
pushed 0 31 30
back 0 31 30
on 0 31 30
this 0 31 30
account, 0 31 30
first 0 31 30
saying 0 31 30
Tuesday 0 31 30
that 0 31 30
there 0 31 30
were 0 31 30
unspecified 0 31 30
inaccuracies 0 31 30
and 0 31 30
then, 0 31 30
on 0 31 30
Thursday, 0 31 30
releasing 0 31 30
a 0 31 30
statement 0 31 30
directly 0 31 30
contradicting 0 31 30
parts 0 31 30
of 0 31 30
what 0 31 30
the 0 31 30
police 0 31 30
had 0 31 30
said…. 0 31 30

Lombardo 0 31 31
had 0 31 31
said 0 31 31
Monday 0 31 31
that 0 31 31
Campos, 0 31 31
the 0 31 31
guard, 0 31 31
was 0 31 31
shot 0 31 31
at 0 31 31
9:59 0 31 31
p.m. 0 31 31
and 0 31 31
that 0 31 31
the 0 31 31
mass 0 31 31
shooting 0 31 31
began 0 31 31
at 0 31 31
10:05 0 31 31
p.m. 0 31 31

This 0 31 32
six-minute 0 31 32
gap 0 31 32
relayed 0 31 32
by 0 31 32
Lombardo 0 31 32
left 0 31 32
uncertain 0 31 32
whether 0 31 32
there 0 31 32
was 0 31 32
any 0 31 32
lag 0 31 32
in 0 31 32
alerting 0 31 32
police 0 31 32
to 0 31 32
the 0 31 32
source 0 31 32
of 0 31 32
the 0 31 32
gunfire 0 31 32
during 0 31 32
critical 0 31 32
moments. 0 31 32

Police 0 31 33
said 0 31 33
officers 0 31 33
arrived 0 31 33
on 0 31 33
the 0 31 33
32nd 0 31 33
floor 0 31 33
at 0 31 33
10:17 0 31 33
p.m., 0 31 33
two 0 31 33
minutes 0 31 33
after 0 31 33
Paddock 0 31 33
had 0 31 33
stopped 0 31 33
firing. 0 31 33

MGM, 0 31 34
though, 0 31 34
said 0 31 34
it 0 31 34
was 0 31 34
“confident” 0 31 34
that 0 31 34
the 0 31 34
9:59 0 31 34
p.m. 0 31 34
time 0 31 34
was 0 31 34
inaccurate 0 31 34
and 0 31 34
“was 0 31 34
derived 0 31 34
from 0 31 34
a 0 31 34
Mandalay 0 31 34
Bay 0 31 34
report 0 31 34
manually 0 31 34
created 0 31 34
after 0 31 34
the 0 31 34
fact 0 31 34
without 0 31 34
the 0 31 34
benefit 0 31 34
of 0 31 34
information 0 31 34
we 0 31 34
now 0 31 34
have.” 0 31 34
The 0 31 34
company 0 31 34
also 0 31 34
disputed 0 31 34
the 0 31 34
suggestion 0 31 34
of 0 31 34
a 0 31 34
lag, 0 31 34
saying 0 31 34
the 0 31 34
shooting 0 31 34
rampage 0 31 34
began 0 31 34
within 0 31 34
a 0 31 34
minute 0 31 34
of 0 31 34
Campos 0 31 34
reporting 0 31 34
his 0 31 34
injury 0 31 34
on 0 31 34
the 0 31 34
32nd 0 31 34
floor. 0 31 34

On 0 31 35
Friday, 0 31 35
Lombardo 0 31 35
effectively 0 31 35
agreed 0 31 35
with 0 31 35
the 0 31 35
company’s 0 31 35
statement, 0 31 35
though 0 31 35
he 0 31 35
argued 0 31 35
that 0 31 35
the 0 31 35
9:59 0 31 35
p.m. 0 31 35
time 0 31 35
he 0 31 35
had 0 31 35
offered 0 31 35
four 0 31 35
days 0 31 35
earlier 0 31 35
“wasn’t 0 31 35
inaccurate 0 31 35
when 0 31 35
I 0 31 35
provided 0 31 35
it.” 0 31 35
Lombardo 0 31 35
said 0 31 35
he 0 31 35
was 0 31 35
told 0 31 35
this 0 31 35
time 0 31 35
had 0 31 35
been 0 31 35
written 0 31 35
by 0 31 35
someone 0 31 35
in 0 31 35
a 0 31 35
security 0 31 35
log. 0 31 35

Upon 0 31 36
investigation, 0 31 36
Lombardo 0 31 36
said, 0 31 36
police 0 31 36
learned 0 31 36
that 0 31 36
Campos 0 31 36
first 0 31 36
encountered 0 31 36
a 0 31 36
barricaded 0 31 36
door 0 31 36
on 0 31 36
the 0 31 36
32nd 0 31 36
floor 0 31 36
at 0 31 36
9:59 0 31 36
p.m. 0 31 36

The 0 31 37
guard 0 31 37
was 0 31 37
eventually 0 31 37
fired 0 31 37
upon 0 31 37
by 0 31 37
Paddock 0 31 37
“in 0 31 37
close 0 31 37
proximity 0 31 37
to” 0 31 37
10:05 0 31 37
p.m., 0 31 37
when 0 31 37
the 0 31 37
mass 0 31 37
shooting 0 31 37
began, 0 31 37
Lombardo 0 31 37
continued. 0 31 37

Clear, 0 31 38
right? 0 31 38

Not 0 31 39
so 0 31 39
fast, 0 31 39
the 0 31 39

As 0 31 45

nothing 0 31 45
