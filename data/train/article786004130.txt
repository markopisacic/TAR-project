I 0
have 0
no 0
idea 0
how 0
you 0
can 0
enter 0
an 0
apartment 0
mistakenly. 0

Does 0
Guyger 0
leave 0
her 0
door 0
unlocked? 0

Furthermore, 0
The 0
Dallas 0
News 0
reports: 0

Jean, 0
who 0
lived 0
on 0
the 0
fourth 0
floor 0
of 0
the 0
South 0
Side 0
Flats 0
in 0
the 0
Cedars, 0
was 0
home 0
alone 0
when 0
Guyger 0
mistook 0
his 0
apartment 0
for 0
hers, 0
the 1
affidavit 1
says. 1

Guyger 0
lived 0
on 0
the 0
third 0
floor, 0
directly 0
beneath 0
his 0
apartment, 0
and 0
mistakenly 0
parked 0
on 0
the 0
fourth 0
floor 0
after 0
finishing 0
a 0
shift 0
at 0
the 0
Dallas 0
Police 0
Department, 0
the 1
affidavit 1
says. 1

When 0
she 0
arrived 0
at 0
Jean's 0
door, 0
Guyger 0
entered 0
a 0
unique 0
door 0
key 0
with 0
an 0
electronic 0
chip 0
into 0
the 0
keyhole, 0
the 1
affidavit 1
says. 1

The 0
door 0
was 0
already 0
ajar, 0
so 0
the 0
force 0
of 0
pushing 0
the 0
key 0
inside 0
opened 0
the 0
door, 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
affidavit. 0

The 1
affidavit 1
says 1
the 0
apartments' 0
"respective 0
interior 0
floorplans 0
are 0
in 0
most 0
ways 0
identical 0
or 0
extremely 0
similar." 0

The 0
apartment 0
was 0
dark 0
and 0
when 0
she 0
saw 0
"a 0
large 0
silhouette," 0
Guyger 0
thought 0
she 0
was 0
being 0
burglarized, 0
the 1
affidavit 1
says. 1

The 1
affidavit 1
says 1
Guyger 0
drew 0
her 0
gun, 0
"gave 0
verbal 0
commands 0
that 0
were 0
ignored" 0
and 0
fired 0
twice. 0

Jean 0
was 0
struck 0
once 0
in 0
the 0
torso. 0

Guyger 0
then 0
called 0
911 0
from 0
her 0
cellphone 0
and 0
started 0
performing 0
first 0
aid. 0

She 0
turned 0
on 0
the 0
lights, 0
then 0
went 0
to 0
the 0
front 0
door 0
again 0
and 0
realized 0
the 0
apartment 0
wasn't 0
hers, 0
the 1
affidavit 1
says. 1

She 0
told 0
the 0
911 0
operator 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
responding 0
officers 0
that 0
she 0
thought 0
she 0
was 0
at 0
her 0
apartment 0
when 0
she 0
shot 0
Jean, 0
according 1
to 1
the 1
affidavit. 1

Ok, 0
some 0
of 0
this 0
seems 0
plausible, 0
but 0
I 0
still 0
am 0
left 0
wondering 0
about 0
the 0
door 0
being 0
ajar. 0

Is 0
this 0
something 0
people 0
are 0
prone 0
to 0
do 0
at 0
1o 0
o'clock 0
at 0
night 0
in 0
Dallas? 0

In 0
any 0
case, 0
we 0
all 0
know 0
that 0
any 0
of 0
us 0
who 0
did 0
the 0
same 0
thing 0
would 0
have 0
immediately 0
been 0
taken 0
into 0
custody. 0

This 0
was 0
not 0
the 0
case 0
with 0
Guyger, 0
though 0
one 0
officer 0
close 0
to 0
her 0
said, 0
"she 0
is 0
devastated." 0

Knowing 0
this 0
provoked 0
outrage 0
across 0
the 0
nation 0
over 0
the 0
weekend. 0

In 0
fact, 0
this 0
is 0
not 0
her 0
first 0
shooting. 0

As 0
a 0
four-year 0
veteran 0
of 0
the 0
force, 0
she 0
was 0
also 0
involved 0
in 0
the 0
shooting 0
of 0
another 0
suspect 0
in 0
2017. 0

men 0
in 0
the 0
8300 0
block 0

the 0
officer 0
asked 0
for 0
backup 0
from 0
Guyger 0
and 0
another 0
officer, 0
according 0
to 0
an 0
affidavit. 0

One 0
of 0
the 0
officers 0
was 0

to 0
search 0
Perez 0
when 0
he 0
became 0
combative, 0

affidavit 1
said. 1

Guyger 0
deployed 0
her 0
Taser 0
before 0
Perez 0

to 0
take 0
it 0
from 0
