Physicist 0
Dan 0
Lubin 0
at 0
the 0
University 0
of 0
California 0
San 0
Diego 0
and 0
two 0
of 0
his 0
colleges 0
managed 0
to 0
collect 0
and 0
observe 0
relevant 0
data 0
for 0
the 0
past 0
20 0
years 0
and 0
came 0
to 0
the 0
conclusion 0
that 0
the 0
giant 0
burning 0
ball 0
of 0
gas 0
in 0
our 0
planetary 0
system 0
might 0
enter 0
a 0
“grand 0
minimum” 0
period 0
of 0
decreased 0
ultraviolet 0
radiation 0
that 0
would 0
last 0
for 0
some 0
11 0
years 0
by 0
mid-century. 0

“The 0
cooldown… 0
[is] 0
a 0
periodic 0
event 0
during 0
which 0
the 0
Sun’s 0
magnetism 0
diminishes, 0
sunspots 0
form 0
infrequently, 0
and 0
less 0
ultraviolet 0
radiation 0
(UV) 0
makes 0
it 0
to 0
the 0
surface 0
of 0
the 0
planet,” 0
researchers 0
noted 0
in 0
a 0
statement 0
earlier 0
this 0
week, 0
adding 0
that 0
“the 0
event 0
is 0
triggered 0
at 0
irregular 0
intervals 0
by 0
random 0
fluctuations 0
related 0
to 0
the 0
Sun’s 0
magnetic 0
field.” 0

The 0
study, 0
whose 0
results 0
were 0
published 0
in 0
The 0
Astrophysical 0
Journal 0
Letters, 0
said 0
the 0
Sun 0
is 0
likely 0
to 0
be 0
6.9 0
percent 0
cooler 0
than 0
its 0
usual 0
lowest 0
amount 0
of 0
activity 0
in 0
the 0
grand 0
minimum. 0

According 0
to 0
the 0
researchers, 0
the 0
cooldown 0
phase 0
could 0
echo 0
those 0
experienced 0
in 0
Europe 0
in 0
the 0
mid-17th 0
century, 0
called 0
the 0
“Maunder 0
Minimum,” 0
or 0
the 0
prolonged 0
sunspot 0
minimum, 0
during 0
which 0
temperatures 0
were 0
low 0
enough 0
to 0
cause 0
London's 0
River 0
Thames 0
to 0
freeze 0
over 0
on 0
a 0
regular 0
basis 0
and 0
to 0
freeze 0
the 0
Baltic 0
Sea 0
to 0
such 0
an 0
extent 0
that 0
Swedish 0
troops 0
were 0
able 0
to 0
invade 0
Denmark 0
in 0
1658 0
on 0
foot 0
by 0
marching 0

the 0
sea 0
ice. 0

However, 0
scientists 0
warned 0
that 0
it 0
should 0
not 0
be 0
assumed 0
that 0
the 0
ultra-cooling 0
of 0
the 0
sun 0
would 0
potentially 0
prevent 0
the 0
negative 0
effects 0
of 0
global 0
warming. 0

“The 0
cooling 0
effect 0
of 0
a 0
grand 0
minimum 0
is 0
only 0
a 0
fraction 0
of 0
the 0
warming 0
effect 0
caused 0
by 0
the 0
increasing 0
concentration 0
of 0
carbon 0
dioxide 0
in 0
the 0
atmosphere,” 0
they 0
said, 0
adding, 0
“After 0
hundreds 0
of 0
thousands 0
of 0
years 0
of 0
CO2 0
levels 0
never 0
exceeding 0
300 0
parts 0
per 0
million 0
in 0
air, 0
the 0
concentration 0
of 0
the 0
greenhouse 0
gas 0
is 0
now 0
over 0
400 0
parts 0
per 0
million, 0
continuing 0
a 0
rise 0
that 0
began 0
with 0
the 0
Industrial 0
Revolution.” 0

The 0
study 0
estimated 0
that 0
the 0
Sun’s 0
mid-century 0
cooldown 0
would 0
probably 0
only 0
result 0
in 0
cooling 0
the 0
Earth 0
by 0
some 0
0.25 0
percent 0
between 0
2020 0
and 0
2070. 0

As 0
a 0
result, 0
the 0
temperature 0
at 0
the 0
surface 0
of 0
our 0
cosmic 0
home 0
would 0
decrease 0
by 0
up 0
to 0
several 0
tenths 0
of 0
a 0
degree 0
Celsius, 0
which 0
is 0
not 0
sufficient 0
to 0
stop 0
global 0
warming, 0
but 0
it 0
could 0
at 0
least 0
soften 0
its 0
effects 0
in 0
part. 0

“Now 0
we 0
have 0
a 0
benchmark 0
from 0
which 0
we 0
can 0
perform 0
better 0
climate 0

We 0
can 0
therefore 0

a 0

idea 0
of 0
how 0
