she 1 101 1
runs 1 101 1
immigration 1 101 1
policy, 1 101 1
right 0 101 1
down 0 101 1
to 0 101 1
how 0 101 1
many 0 101 1
times 0 101 1
someone 0 101 1
can 0 101 1
have 0 101 1
their 0 101 1
case 0 101 1
reviewed, 0 101 1
though 0 101 1
she 0 101 1
seems 0 101 1
confused 0 101 1
as 0 101 1
to 0 101 1
who 0 101 1
will 0 101 1
do 0 101 1
the 0 101 1
reviewing 0 101 1
of 0 101 1
those 0 101 1
cases. 0 101 1

At 0 101 2
issue 0 101 2
is 0 101 2
a 0 101 2
large 0 101 2
group 0 101 2
of 0 101 2
Indonesian 0 101 2
Chinese 0 101 2
Christians 0 101 2
who 0 101 2
fled 0 101 2
a 0 101 2
pogrom 1 101 2
in 0 101 2
Indonesia 0 101 2
directed 0 101 2
against 0 101 2
them 0 101 2
in 0 101 2
the 0 101 2
1990s. 0 101 2

The 0 101 3
Chinese 0 101 3
generally 0 101 3
filed 0 101 3
asylum 0 101 3
applications 0 101 3
after 0 101 3
arriving 0 101 3
in 0 101 3
the 0 101 3
United 0 101 3
States, 0 101 3
and, 0 101 3
importantly, 0 101 3
not 0 101 3
at 0 101 3
an 0 101 3
American 0 101 3
embassy 0 101 3
or 0 101 3
consulate 0 101 3
in 0 101 3
Indonesia 0 101 3
or 0 101 3
nearby. 0 101 3

All 0 101 4
were 0 101 4
relatively 0 101 4
wealthy 0 101 4
and 0 101 4
had 0 101 4
or 0 101 4
obtained 0 101 4
tourist 0 101 4
visas 0 101 4
to 0 101 4
the 0 101 4
United 0 101 4
States. 0 101 4

This 0 101 5
is 0 101 5
important 0 101 5
as 0 101 5
most 0 101 5
actual 0 101 5
"refugees" 0 101 5
drop 0 101 5
everything 0 101 5
to 0 101 5
flee 0 101 5
their 0 101 5
homelands 0 101 5
if 0 101 5
they 0 101 5
are 0 101 5
under 0 101 5
threat 0 101 5
of 0 101 5
death. 0 101 5

Tellingly, 1 101 6
these 1 101 6
asylum 1 101 6
applicants 1 101 6
were 1 101 6
the 1 101 6
elite 1 101 6
of 1 101 6
Indonesian 1 101 6
society, 1 101 6
because 1 101 6
their 1 101 6
higher 1 101 6
average 1 101 6
IQ, 1 101 6
than 1 101 6
the 1 101 6
rather 1 101 6
dull 1 101 6
Indonesians. 1 101 6

87 0 101 7
is 0 101 7
the 0 101 7
average 0 101 7
Indonesian 0 101 7
IQ 0 101 7
, 0 101 7
and 0 101 7
note 0 101 7
that 0 101 7
average 0 101 7
includes 0 101 7
the 0 101 7
higher 0 101 7
average 0 101 7
Chinese, 0 101 7
so 1 101 7
the 1 101 7
locals 1 101 7
really 1 101 7
are 1 101 7
a 1 101 7
dull 1 101 7
lot. 1 101 7

This 0 101 8
is 0 101 8
important 0 101 8
in 0 101 8
that 0 101 8
while 0 101 8
there 0 101 8
was 0 101 8
anti-Chinese 0 101 8
and 0 101 8
anti-Christian 0 101 8
violence, 0 101 8
the 0 101 8
non-Chinese 0 101 8
Christians 0 101 8
mostly 0 101 8
stuck 0 101 8
around, 0 101 8
though 0 101 8
the 0 101 8
Chinese 0 101 8
used 0 101 8
tourist 0 101 8
and 0 101 8
student 0 101 8
visas 0 101 8
to 0 101 8
come 0 101 8
to 0 101 8
the 0 101 8
United 0 101 8
States 0 101 8
in 0 101 8
a 0 101 8
leisurely 0 101 8
manner, 0 101 8
taking 0 101 8
time 0 101 8
to 0 101 8
either 0 101 8
bring 0 101 8
or 0 101 8
otherwise 0 101 8
secure 0 101 8
their 0 101 8
wealth 0 101 8
in 0 101 8
Indonesia. 0 101 8

In 0 101 9
any 0 101 9
event, 0 101 9
the 0 101 9
persecution 0 101 9
was 0 101 9
limited 0 101 9
in 0 101 9
time 0 101 9
and 0 101 9
duration 0 101 9
as 0 101 9
the 0 101 9
local 0 101 9
elite 0 101 9
know 0 101 9
they 0 101 9
need 0 101 9

run 0 101 9
the 0 101 9

In 0 101 10
the 0 101 10
United 0 101 10
States, 0 101 10
these 0 101 10
Chinese 0 101 10

through 0 101 10
the 0 101 10
liberal 0 101 10

Fast 0 101 11
forward 0 101 11
to 0 101 11
the 0 101 11
Obama 0 101 11
Regime 0 101 11
Administrative 0 101 11
Amnesty 0 101 11
, 0 101 11
where 0 101 11
despite 0 101 11
outstanding 0 101 11
deportation 0 101 11
orders, 0 101 11
these 0 101 11
illegal 0 101 11
aliens, 0 101 11
among 0 101 11
millions 0 101 11
of 0 101 11
others, 0 101 11
are 0 101 11
allowed 0 101 11
to 0 101 11
remain, 0 101 11
and 0 101 11
then 0 101 11
given 0 101 11
employment 0 101 11
authorization 0 101 11
as 0 101 11
well. 0 101 11

Fortunately, 1 101 12
elections 1 101 12
have 1 101 12
consequences, 1 101 12
and 1 101 12
the 1 101 12

Administrative 1 101 12
Amnesty, 1 101 12
or 1 101 12
parts 1 101 12
of 1 101 12
it, 1 101 12
came 1 101 12
to 1 101 12
an 1 101 12
inglorious 1 101 12
end. 1 101 12

And 0 101 13
end 0 101 13
it 0 101 13
was 0 101 13
for 0 101 13
this 0 101 13
particular 0 101 13
lot 0 101 13
of 0 101 13
illegal 0 101 13
aliens. 0 101 13

But 0 101 14
Kritarch 0 101 14
Patti 0 101 14
Saris 0 101 14
was 0 101 14
having 0 101 14
none 0 101 14
of 0 101 14
the 0 101 14
immigration 0 101 14
laws 0 101 14
of 0 101 14
the 0 101 14
United 0 101 14
States. 0 101 14

She 0 101 15
thought 0 101 15
she 0 101 15
was 0 101 15
decider-in-chief 1 101 15
on 1 101 15
who 1 101 15
gets 1 101 15
deported. 1 101 15

And 0 101 16
all 0 101 16
on 0 101 16
the 0 101 16
flimsy 0 101 16
excuse 0 101 16
that 0 101 16
the 0 101 16
aliens 1 101 16
need 0 101 16
another 1 101 16
bite 1 101 16
at 1 101 16
the 1 101 16
apple, 1 101 16
despite 0 101 16
the 0 101 16
clear 0 101 16
fact 0 101 16
that 0 101 16
the 0 101 16
Indonesian 0 101 16
government 0 101 16
had 0 101 16
long 0 101 16
ago 0 101 16
quashed 0 101 16
the 0 101 16
ethnic 0 101 16
riots 0 101 16
directed 0 101 16
against 0 101 16
the 0 101 16
market 0 101 16
dominant 0 101 16
minority 0 101 16
of 0 101 16
Chinese 0 101 16
and 0 101 16
the 0 101 16
religious 0 101 16
motivated 0 101 16
violence 0 101 16
against 0 101 16
Christians. 0 101 16

While 0 101 17
there 0 101 17
are 0 101 17
a 0 101 17
couple 0 101 17
of 0 101 17
provinces 0 101 17
in 0 101 17
Indonesia 0 101 17
that 0 101 17
impose 0 101 17
Sharia 0 101 17
law 0 101 17
on 0 101 17
Muslims, 0 101 17
most 0 101 17
non-Muslims 0 101 17
are 0 101 17
exempt. 0 101 17

As 0 101 18
moderates 0 101 18
go, 0 101 18
Indonesia 0 101 18
is 0 101 18
about 0 101 18
as 0 101 18
close 0 101 18
as 0 101 18
it 0 101 18
gets 0 101 18
to 0 101 18
moderate 0 101 18
Muslims. 0 101 18

Mostly 0 101 19
because 0 101 19
the 1 101 19
country 1 101 19
would 1 101 19
not 1 101 19

Before 0 101 20

was 0 101 20
the 0 101 20
high 0 101 20

now 0 101 20
it's 0 101 20
the 0 101 20

Remember, 0 101 21
an 1 101 21
87 1 101 21

is 1 101 21
just 1 101 21
about 1 101 21

them 0 101 30
of 0 101 30

Indonesia 0 101 31
is 0 101 31
more 0 101 31
hospitable 0 101 31
to 0 101 31
Chinese 0 101 31
Christians 0 101 31
today 0 101 31
than 0 101 31
the 0 101 31
short 0 101 31
period 0 101 31
in 0 101 31
the 0 101 31
90s 0 101 31
when 0 101 31
there 0 101 31
was 0 101 31
a 0 101 31
problem. 0 101 31

But 0 101 32
basically, 0 101 32
Saris 0 101 32
wants 0 101 32
the 0 101 32
illegal 1 101 32
aliens 1 101 32
the 0 101 32
opportunity 0 101 32

and 0 101 32
benefit 0 101 32
by 0 101 32
the 0 101 32
years 0 101 32
it 0 101 32
will 0 101 32
take 0 101 32
to 0 101 32
adjudicate 0 101 32
those 0 101 32
claims. 0 101 32

Basically 0 101 33
Saris 0 101 33
wants 0 101 33
these 0 101 33
illegals 0 101 33
to 0 101 33
never 0 101 33
leave. 0 101 33

That, 0 101 34
of 0 101 34
course 0 101 34
is 0 101 34
not 0 101 34
her 0 101 34
role. 0 101 34

The 0 101 35
only 0 101 35
claim 0 101 35
they 0 101 35
have 0 101 35
before 0 101 35
a 0 101 35
Federal 0 101 35
court 0 101 35
is 0 101 35
if 0 101 35
they 0 101 35
got 0 101 35
the 0 101 35
due 0 101 35
process 0 101 35
that 0 101 35
Congress 0 101 35
gave 0 101 35
those 0 101 35
illegal 1 101 35
aliens. 1 101 35

And 0 101 36
they 0 101 36
did, 0 101 36
they 0 101 36
filed 0 101 36
for 0 101 36
asylum, 0 101 36
had 0 101 36
a 0 101 36
hearing 0 101 36
and 0 101 36
appeals, 0 101 36
and 0 101 36
lost. 0 101 36

With 0 101 37
the 0 101 37
legislative 0 101 37
fight 0 101 37
over 0 101 37
DACA, 0 101 37
the 0 101 37
Trump 0 101 37

needs 0 101 37

make 0 101 37
American 0 101 37
