Kritarch 1
Patti 1
Saris 1
thinks 1
she 1
runs 1
immigration 1
policy, 1
right 0
down 0
to 0
how 0
many 0
times 0
someone 0
can 0
have 0
their 0
case 0
reviewed, 0
though 0
she 0
seems 0
confused 0
as 0
to 0
who 0
will 0
do 0
the 0
reviewing 0
of 0
those 0
cases. 0

At 0
issue 0
is 0
a 0
large 0
group 0
of 0
Indonesian 0
Chinese 0
Christians 0
who 0
fled 0
a 0
pogrom 1
in 0
Indonesia 0
directed 0
against 0
them 0
in 0
the 0
1990s. 0

The 0
Chinese 0
generally 0
filed 0
asylum 0
applications 0
after 0
arriving 0
in 0
the 0
United 0
States, 0
and, 0
importantly, 0
not 0
at 0
an 0
American 0
embassy 0
or 0
consulate 0
in 0
Indonesia 0
or 0
nearby. 0

All 0
were 0
relatively 0
wealthy 0
and 0
had 0
or 0
obtained 0
tourist 0
visas 0
to 0
the 0
United 0
States. 0

This 0
is 0
important 0
as 0
most 0
actual 0
"refugees" 0
drop 0
everything 0
to 0
flee 0
their 0
homelands 0
if 0
they 0
are 0
under 0
threat 0
of 0
death. 0

Tellingly, 1
these 1
asylum 1
applicants 1
were 1
the 1
elite 1
of 1
Indonesian 1
society, 1
because 1
their 1
higher 1
average 1
IQ, 1
than 1
the 1
rather 1
dull 1
Indonesians. 1

87 0
is 0
the 0
average 0
Indonesian 0
IQ 0
, 0
and 0
note 0
that 0
average 0
includes 0
the 0
higher 0
average 0
Chinese, 0
so 1
the 1
locals 1
really 1
are 1
a 1
dull 1
lot. 1

This 0
is 0
important 0
in 0
that 0
while 0
there 0
was 0
anti-Chinese 0
and 0
anti-Christian 0
violence, 0
the 0
non-Chinese 0
Christians 0
mostly 0
stuck 0
around, 0
though 0
the 0
Chinese 0
used 0
tourist 0
and 0
student 0
visas 0
to 0
come 0
to 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
in 0
a 0
leisurely 0
manner, 0
taking 0
time 0
to 0
either 0
bring 0
or 0
otherwise 0
secure 0
their 0
wealth 0
in 0
Indonesia. 0

In 0
any 0
event, 0
the 0
persecution 0
was 0
limited 0
in 0
time 0
and 0
duration 0
as 0
the 0
local 0
elite 0
know 0
they 0
need 0
the 0
Chinese 0
to 0
run 0
the 0
economy 0
and 0
to 0
avoid 0
Red 1
China 1
intervening 0
on 0
behalf 0
of 0
their 0
fellow 0
ethnics. 0

In 0
the 0
United 0
States, 0
these 0
Chinese 0
went 0
through 0
the 0
liberal 0
asylum 0
process, 0
but 0
did 0
not 0
manage 0
to 0
fool 1
even 1
the 1
credulous 1
"judges" 1
at 0
the 0
Executive 0
Office 0
for 0
Immigration 0
Review 0
(EOIR), 0
the 0
immigration 0
courts. 0

Fast 0
forward 0
to 0
the 0
Obama 0
Regime 0
Administrative 0
Amnesty 0
, 0
where 0
despite 0
outstanding 0
deportation 0
orders, 0
these 0
illegal 0
aliens, 0
among 0
millions 0
of 0
others, 0
are 0
allowed 0
to 0
remain, 0
and 0
then 0
given 0
employment 0
authorization 0
as 0
well. 0

Fortunately, 1
elections 1
have 1
consequences, 1
and 1
the 1
Obama 1
Regime 1
Administrative 1
Amnesty, 1
or 1
parts 1
of 1
it, 1
came 1
to 1
an 1
inglorious 1
end. 1

And 0
end 0
it 0
was 0
for 0
this 0
particular 0
lot 0
of 0
illegal 0
aliens. 0

But 0
Kritarch 0
Patti 0
Saris 0
was 0
having 0
none 0
of 0
the 0
immigration 0
laws 0
of 0
the 0
United 0
States. 0

She 0
thought 0
she 0
was 0
decider-in-chief 1
on 1
who 1
gets 1
deported. 1

And 0
all 0
on 0
the 0
flimsy 0
excuse 0
that 0
the 0
aliens 1
need 0
another 1
bite 1
at 1
the 1
apple, 1
despite 0
the 0
clear 0
fact 0
that 0
the 0
Indonesian 0
government 0
had 0
long 0
ago 0
quashed 0
the 0
ethnic 0
riots 0
directed 0
against 0
the 0
market 0
dominant 0
minority 0
of 0
Chinese 0
and 0
the 0
religious 0
motivated 0
violence 0
against 0
Christians. 0

While 0
there 0
are 0
a 0
couple 0
of 0
provinces 0
in 0
Indonesia 0
that 0
impose 0
Sharia 0
law 0
on 0
Muslims, 0
most 0
non-Muslims 0
are 0
exempt. 0

As 0
moderates 0
go, 0
Indonesia 0
is 0
about 0
as 0
close 0
as 0
it 0
gets 0
to 0
moderate 0
Muslims. 0

Mostly 0
because 0
the 1
country 1
would 1
not 1
last 1
long 1
without 1
an 1
outside 1
high 1
IQ 1
elite 1
to 1
run 1
the 1
country. 1

Before 0
it 0
was 0
the 0
high 0
IQ 0
Dutch, 0
now 0
it's 0
the 0
Chinese. 0

Remember, 0
an 1
87 1
IQ 1
is 1
just 1
about 1
retarded. 1

A 0
federal 0
judge 0
on 0
Monday 0
ordered 0
U.S. 0
immigration 0
officials 0
to 0
delay 0
any 0
efforts 0
to 0
deport 0
51 0
Indonesians 0
living 0
illegally 0
in 0
New 0
Hampshire 0
so 0
the 0
group 0
can 0
have 0
time 0
to 0
argue 0
that 0
changing 0
conditions 0
in 0
that 0
country 0
would 0
make 0
it 0
dangerous 0
to 0
return... 0
Federal 0
law 0
gives 0
authority 0
over 0
immigration 0
matters 0
to 0
the 0
executive 0
branch, 0
not 0
the 0
courts. 0

Chief 0
U.S. 0
District 0
Judge 0
Patti 0
Saris 0
in 0
Boston 0
found 0
she 0
had 0
authority 0
to 0
ensure 0
the 0
Indonesians 0
have 0
a 0
chance 0
to 0
argue 0
that 0
conditions 0
in 0
their 0
home 0
country 0
had 0
deteriorated 0
significantly 0
enough 0
to 0
reopen 0
their 0
cases 0
for 0
trying 0
to 0
stay 0
in 0
the 0
United 0
State. 0

She 0
worried 0
that 0
without 0
the 0
order, 0
ICE 0
officials 0
could 0
deport 0
some 0
of 0
the 0
Indonesians 0
covered 0
by 0
the 0
suit, 0
at 0
which 0
time 0
they 0
would 0
lose 0
the 0
opportunity 0
to 0
have 0
their 0
cases 0
reopened. 0

by 0
Scott 0
Malone, 0
Reuters, 0
November 0
27, 0
2017] 0

Kritarch 0
Saris 0
thought 0
she 0
knew 0
better 0
and 0
has 0
been 0
running 0
a 0
deliberate 0
campaign 0
to 0
prevent 0
the 0
deportation 0
of 0
these 0
Chinese 0
illegal 1
aliens. 1

And 0
now 0
she 1
has 1
gone 1
full 1
rogue, 1
prohibiting 0
the 0
deportation 0
of 0
all 0
these 0
illegal 1
aliens 1
who 0
already 0
had 0
their 0
day 0
in 0
immigration 0
court.Saris 0
appears 0
to 0
be 0
making 0
up 0
immigration 0
law 0
and 0
procedure 0
on 0
the 0
fly, 0
as 0
her 0
order 0
appears 0
to 0
not 0
understand 0
either 0
the 0
EOIR 0
process 0
or 0
immigration 0
law. 0

“The 0
government 0
shall 0
inform 0
the 0
court 0
whether 0
petitioners, 0
who 0
are 0
not 0
detained, 0
will 0
have 0
access 0
to 0
emergency 0
procedures 0
if 0
they 0
must 0
file 0
their 0
original 0
motions 0
to 0
reopen,” 0
Saris 0
wrote. 0

This 0
makes 0
no 0
sense 0
in 0
English, 0
much 0
less 0
in 0
the 0
established 0
procedures 0
in 0
the 0
EOIR. 0

The 0
aliens 1
have 0
no 0
emergency, 0
there 0
are 0
no 0
emergency 0
procedures, 0
and 0
their 0
original 0
motions 0
to 0
reopen 0
were 0
denied 0
for 0
lack 0
of 0
legal 0
basis 0
in 0
law 0
or 0
any 0
changed 0
conditions 0
in 0
the 0
country 0
they 0
are 0
being 0
deported 0
to 0
that 0
would 0
avail 0
them 0
of 0
another 0
claim. 0

Indonesia 0
is 0
more 0
hospitable 0
to 0
Chinese 0
Christians 0
today 0
than 0
the 0
short 0
period 0
in 0
the 0
90s 0
when 0
there 0
was 0
a 0
problem. 0

But 0
basically, 0
Saris 0
wants 0
the 0
illegal 1
aliens 1
the 0
opportunity 0
to 0
submit 0
another 0
asylum 0
application, 0
and 0
benefit 0
by 0
the 0
years 0
it 0
will 0
take 0
to 0
adjudicate 0
those 0
claims. 0

Basically 0
Saris 0
wants 0
these 0
illegals 0
to 0
never 0
leave. 0

That, 0
of 0
course 0
is 0
not 0
her 0
role. 0

The 0
only 0
claim 0
they 0
have 0
before 0
a 0
Federal 0
court 0
is 0
if 0
they 0
got 0
the 0
due 0
process 0
that 0
Congress 0
gave 0
those 0
illegal 1
aliens. 1

And 0
they 0
did, 0
they 0
filed 0
for 0
asylum, 0
had 0
a 0
hearing 0
and 0
appeals, 0
and 0
lost. 0

With 0
the 0
legislative 0
fight 0
over 0
DACA, 0
the 0
Trump 0
Administration 0
needs 0
to 0
include 0
legislative 0
language 0
including 0
more 0
restrictions 0
on 0
kritarchs 0
who 0
want 0
to 0
make 0
American 0
immigration 0
policy, 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
other 0
reforms 0
to 0
lower 0
legal 0
immigration, 0
build 0
the 0
wall, 0
and 0
deport 0
illegals 0
here. 0

Or 0
impeachment, 0
or 0
both. 0
