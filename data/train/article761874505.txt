a 0 244 2
year 0 244 2
in 0 244 2

which 0 244 2
he 0 244 2

he 0 244 2
was 0 244 2
subject 0 244 2
to 0 244 2
unequal 0 244 2
protection 0 244 2
of 0 244 2

Saucier 0 244 3
said 0 244 3
that 0 244 3
he 0 244 3
realizes 0 244 3
he 0 244 3
had 0 244 3
erred 0 244 3
in 0 244 3
taking 0 244 3
the 0 244 3
photos, 0 244 3
which 0 244 3
he 0 244 3
said 0 244 3
he 0 244 3
wanted 0 244 3
to 0 244 3
show 0 244 3
only 0 244 3

his 0 244 3

he 0 244 3
worked. 0 244 3

He 0 244 4
has 0 244 4
also 0 244 4
lashed 0 244 4
out 0 244 4
at 0 244 4
Obama 0 244 4
officials, 0 244 4
saying 0 244 4
that 0 244 4
his 0 244 4
prosecution 0 244 4
was 0 244 4
politically 0 244 4
motivated, 0 244 4
prompted 0 244 4
by 0 244 4
sensitivity 0 244 4
about 0 244 4
classified 0 244 4

Saucier 0 244 5
argues 0 244 5
that 0 244 5
the 0 244 5

to 0 244 5
Saucier 0 244 5
for 0 244 5
his 0 244 5
actions 0 244 5
chose 0 244 5
to 0 244 5
be 0 244 5
lenient 0 244 5
with 0 244 5
Hillary 0 244 5
Clinton 0 244 5
in 0 244 5

the 1 244 12

thing 1 244 12
and 1 244 12
weren’t 1 244 12
treated 1 244 12

We 0 244 13

correct 0 244 13
the 0 244 13
wrong.” 0 244 13
Daigle 0 244 13
said 0 244 13
that 0 244 13
a 0 244 13
notice 0 244 13
about 0 244 13
the 0 244 13
pending 0 244 13

There 0 244 14
is 0 244 14
usually 0 244 14
a 0 244 14
six-month 0 244 14
period 0 244 14
that 0 244 14
must 0 244 14

actually 0 244 14
filed. 0 244 14

“My 0 244 15
case 0 244 15
was 0 244 15
usually 0 244 15
something 0 244 15
handled 0 244 15
by 0 244 15
military 0 244 15
courts,” 0 244 15
he 0 244 15
said. 0 244 15

“They 1 244 16
used 1 244 16
me 1 244 16
as 1 244 16
an 1 244 16
example 1 244 16
because 1 244 16
of 1 244 16
[the 1 244 16
backlash 1 244 16
over] 1 244 16

his 0 244 16

“With 0 244 17
a 0 244 17
pardon, 0 244 17
there’s 0 244 17
no 0 244 17
magic 0 244 17
wand 0 244 17
that 0 244 17
gets 0 244 17

everything 0 244 17
right,” 0 244 17

“But 0 244 17
I 0 244 17
try 0 244 17
to 0 244 17
stay 0 244 17

has 0 244 17
had 0 244 17

is 0 244 17
in 0 244 17
debt 0 244 17
due 0 244 17
to 0 244 17
the 0 244 17
loss 0 244 17
of 0 244 17
income 0 244 17
after 0 244 17
having 0 244 17
a 0 244 17
felony 0 244 17
on 0 244 17
his 0 244 17
record. 0 244 17

The 0 244 18
government 0 244 18
actively 1 244 18
destroyed 1 244 18
his 1 244 18
life 1 244 18
an 1 244 18
made 1 244 18
it 1 244 18
all 1 244 18
but 1 244 18
impossible 1 244 18
for 0 244 18
his 0 244 18
family 0 244 18
to 0 244 18
get 0 244 18
back 0 244 18
on 0 244 18
track. 0 244 18

But 0 244 19
Hillary 0 244 19
Clinton 0 244 19
is 0 244 19
running 0 244 19
around 0 244 19
free, 1 244 19
to 0 244 19
this 0 244 19
day. 0 244 19

that 0 244 19

is 0 244 19

what 0 244 19

Saucier 0 244 19

is 0 244 19

so 0 244 19

burnt 0 244 19

about, 0 244 19

with 1 244 19

reason. 1 244 19
