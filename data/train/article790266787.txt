Freak 1
Show 1

On 0
the 0
eve 0
of 0
a 0
historic 0
Supreme 0
Court 0
confirmation 0
hearing, 0
two 0
more 0
women 0
have 1
materialized 1
out 1
of 1
thin 1
air 1
to 0
accuse 0
President 0
Trump’s 0
high 0
court 0
nominee 0
Brett 0
Kavanaugh 0
of 0
sexual 0
improprieties 0
– 0
bringing 0
the 0
total 0
number 0
of 0
accusers 0
to 0
four. 0

Even 0
more 0
eleventh-hour 0
character-assassination 1
attempts 0
may 0
be 0
coming 0
given 0
the 1
enraged 1
Left’s 1
determination 0
to 0
prevent 0
the 0
judge’s 0
ascent 0
to 0
the 0
Supreme 0
Court 0
at 0
all 0
costs. 0

Whether 0
the 0
claims 0
are 0
true 0
is 0
irrelevant 0
to 0
these 0
people. 0

Only 0
the 0
seriousness 0
and 0
luridness 0
of 0
the 0
charges 0
matter 0
as 0
they 0
get 0
aired 0
over 0
and 0
over 0
again 0
in 0
the 0
24-hour 0
news 0
cycle. 0

They 0
don’t 0
care 0
about 0
the 0
victims 0
they 0
create. 0

Only 0
the 0
headlines. 0

The 0
new 0
allegations 0
surfaced 0
yesterday 0
as 0
the 0
Senate 0
Judiciary 0
Committee 0
battens 1
down 1
the 1
hatches 1
for 0
a 0
hearing 0
today 0
to 0
receive 0
oral 0
evidence 0
from 0
the 0
first 0
accuser, 0
Christine 0
Blasey 0
Ford, 0
51, 0
who 0
claims 0
Kavanaugh, 0
53, 0
tried 0
to 0
rape 0
her 0
decades 0
ago 0
when 0
he 0
was 0
a 0
high 0
school 0
student. 0

The 0
third 0
accuser 0
is 0
Julie 0
Swetnick, 0
a 0
55-year-old 0
certified 0
systems 0
engineer, 0
who 0
on 0
Wednesday 0
claimed 0
that 0
in 0
the 0
early 0
1980s 0
Kavanaugh 0
and 0
others 0
spiked 0
the 0
drinks 0
of 0
young 0
women 0
at 0
high 0
school 0
parties 0
with 0
intoxicants 0
to 0
clear 0
the 0
way 0
for 0
them 0
to 0
be 0
gang-raped. 0

Incredibly, 0
Swetnick 0
said 0
in 0
a 0
sworn 0
statement 0
that 0
she 0
witnessed 0
gang 0
rapes 0
at 0
these 0
parties 0
but 0
kept 0
on 0
attending 0
them 0
anyway. 0

It 0
gets 0
weirder. 0

Kavanaugh 0
was 0
a 1
“mean 1
drunk,” 1
she 0
stated. 0

He 0
drank 0
excessively 0
at 0
these 0
parties 0
and 0
would 0
grind 0
against 0
girls 0
and 0
try 0
to 0
take 0
their 0
clothing 0
of, 0
she 0
said. 0

Swetnick 0
claimed 0
to 0
have 0
been 0
gang-raped 1
at 0
one 0
of 0
these 0
parties 0
in 0
1982 0
as 0
a 0
result 0
of 0
consuming 0
a 0
spiked 0
drink 0
that 0
contained 0
“Quaaludes 0
or 0
something 0
similar.” 0
Kavanaugh 0
and 0
his 0
friend 0
Mark 0
Judge 0
were 0
present 0
at 0
the 0
party 0
at 0
which 0
she 0
was 0
raped, 0
she 0
states, 0
but 0
she 0
doesn’t 0
accuse 0
them 0
of 0
participating 0
in 0
it. 0

In 0
response, 0
Kavanaugh 0
labeled 0
Swetnick's 0
salacious 0
allegations 0
"ridiculous 1
and 1
from 1
the 1
Twilight 1
Zone." 1

"I 0
don't 0
know 0
who 0
this 0
is 0
and 0
this 0
never 0
happened," 0
the 0
judicial 0
nominee 0
added. 0

A 0
CNBC 0
summary 0
describes 0
Swetnick: 0

A 0
1980 0
graduate 0
of 0
Gaithersburg 0
High 0
School 0
in 0
Maryland, 0
she 0
said 0
she 0
has 0
held 0
multiple 0
clearances 0
for 0
work 0
done 0
at 0
the 0
Treasury 0
Department, 0
U.S. 0
Mint, 0
IRS, 0
State 0
Department 0
and 0
Justice 0
Department, 0
among 0
other 0
government 0
agencies. 0

Swetnick 0
says 0
in 0
her 0
affidavit 0
that 0
she 0
saw 0
Kavanaugh 0
in 0
the 0
early 0
1980s 0
"drink 0
excessively 0
at 0
many" 0
house 0
parties 0
in 0
suburban 0
Maryland. 0

At 0
the 0
time, 0
Kavanaugh 0
and 0
Judge 0
were 0
students 0
at 0
Georgetown 0
Prep, 0
a 0
private 0
Catholic 0
all-boys 0
school. 0

She 0
said 0
Kavanaugh 0
and 0
Judge 0
engaged 0
in 0
"abusive 0
and 0
physically 0
aggressive 0
behavior 0
toward 0
girls," 0
which 0
"included 0
the 0
fondling 0
and 0
groping 0
of 0
girls 0
without 0
their 0
consent" 0
and 0
"not 0
taking 0
'No' 0
for 0
an 0
answer." 0

Predictably, 0
all 0
10 0
Democrat 0
members 0
of 0
the 0
Judiciary 0
Committee 0
urged 0
President 0
Trump 0
to 0
either 0
"immediately 0
withdraw 0
the 0
nomination 0
or 0
order 0
an 0
FBI 0
investigation 0
into 0
all 0
the 0
allegations." 0

There 0
is 0
no 0
indication 0
so 0
far 0
that 0
the 0
president 0
will 0
oblige 0
them. 0

To 0
no 0
one’s 0
surprise, 0
Trump’s 1
legal 1
tormentor, 1
Stormy 0
Daniels 0
attorney 0
Michael 0
Avenatti, 0
whom 0
Tucker 0
Carlson 0
has 0
dubbed 0
“creepy 1
porn 1
lawyer,” 1
is 0
representing 0
Swetnick. 0

"There 0
should 0
be 0
an 0
immediate 0
investigation" 0
of 0
Swetnick’s 0
dramatic 0
allegations, 0
Avenatti 0
said 0
on 0
MSNBC, 0
"and 0
there 0
should 0
be 0
no 0
rush 0
to 0
confirm 0
him 0
to 0
the 0
U.S. 0
Supreme 0
Court." 0

The 0
president 0
slammed 1
Avenatti. 0

“Avenatti 1
is 1
a 1
third 1
rate 1
lawyer 1
who 1
is 1
good 1
at 1
making 1
false 1
accusations, 1
like 1
he 1
did 1
on 1
me 1
and 1
like 1
he 1
is 1
now 1
doing 1
on 1
Judge 1
Brett 1
Kavanaugh[,]” 1
Trump 0
wrote 0
on 0
Twitter. 0

“He 1
is 1
just 1
looking 1
for 1
attention 1
and 1
doesn’t 1
want 1
people 1
to 1
look 1
at 1
his 1
past 1
record 1
and 1
relationships 1
- 0
a 1
total 1
low-life!” 1

He 0
rejected 0
Swetnick’s 0
allegations 0
as 0
“another 1
beauty” 1
and 0
described 0
Avenatti 0
as 0
a 0
“con 1
artist.” 1

“All 0
of 0
a 0
sudden, 0
the 0
hearings 0
are 0
over, 0
and 0
the 0
rumors 0
start 0
coming 0
out,” 0
Trump 0
said. 0

“And 0
then 0
you 0
this 1
other 1
con 1
artist, 1
Avenatti, 1
come 0
out 0
with 0
another 1
beauty 1
today." 0

A 0
fourth 0
accuser 0
popped 0
up 0
yesterday, 0

According 0
to 0
an 0
interview 0
transcript 0
released 0
Wednesday 0
night 0
by 0
the 0
Senate 0
Judiciary 0
Committee: 0

An 0
anonymous 0
woman 0
wrote 0
to 0
Sen. 0
Cory 0
Gardner’s 0
(R-Colo.) 0
office 0
on 0
Sept. 0
22 0
alleging 0
that 0
the 0
Supreme 0
Court 0
nominee 0
shoved 0
another 0
woman 0
“up 0
against 0
the 0
wall 0
very 0
aggressively 0
and 0
sexually” 0
in 0
1998 0
after 0
leaving 0
a 0
bar 0
where 0
both 0
had 0
been 0
drinking, 0
the 0
transcript 0
states. 0

Kavanaugh 0
denied 0
any 0
involvement 0
in 0
the 0
events 0
alleged 0
in 0
that 0
complaint, 0
which 0
was 0
first 0
reported 0
by 0
NBC. 0

Depending 0
on 0
how 0
you 0
do 0
the 0
counting, 0
there 0
may 0
even 0
be 0
a 0
fifth 0
and 0
sixth 0
accusation 0
against 0
Kavanaugh. 0

The 0
newspaper 0
account 0
continues: 0

The 0
transcript 0
of 0
Kavanaugh's 0
Tuesday 0
interview 0
also 0
cited 0
another 0
anonymous 0
claim 0
of 0
sexual 0
misconduct 0
involving 0
Kavanaugh, 0
dating 0
back 0
to 0
1985 0
and 0
sent 0
to 0
the 0
office 0
of 0
Sen. 0
Sheldon 0
Whitehouse 0
(D-R.I.), 0
which 0
the 0
judge 0
also 0
flatly 0
denied 0
to 0
investigators. 0

And 0
GOP 0
investigators 0
said 0
late 0
Wednesday 0
they 0
received 0
an 0
additional 0
anonymous 0
claim 0
of 0
rape 0
passed 0
along 0
by 0
Sen. 0
Kamala 0
Harris 0
(D-Calif.). 0

Accuser 0
number 0
two 0
is 0
Deborah 0
Ramirez, 0
53, 0
who 0
went 0
public 0
with 0
her 0
claims 0
in 0
a 0
New 0
Yorker 0
magazine 0
article 0
Sunday. 0

Ramirez 0
alleges 0
she 0
was 0
assaulted 0
by 0
Kavanaugh 0
at 0
a 0
drunken 0
party 0
decades 0
ago 0
at 0
Yale 0
College. 0

She 0
claims 0
Kavanaugh 0
exposed 0
himself 0
to 0
her 0
and 0
brushed 0
his 0
genitals 0
against 0
her. 0

If 0
Kavanaugh 0
isn’t 0
on 0
the 0
bench 0
Monday, 0
the 0
Supreme 0
Court 0
will 0
be 0
shorthanded 0
as 0
it 0
begins 0
hearing 0
cases 0
in 0
its 0
new 0
term. 0

It 0
normally 0
has 0
a 0
complement 0
of 0
nine 0
justices 0
but 0
with 0
Anthony 0
Kennedy’s 0
retirement 0
July 0
31, 0
which 0
cleared 0
the 0
way 0
for 0
Kavanaugh’s 0
nomination, 0
there 0
have 0
been 0
only 0
eight 0
justices. 0

Roughly 0
speaking 0
there 0
is 0
a 0
4-to-4 0
liberal 0
to 0
conservative 0
ideological 0
split 0
on 0
the 0
court. 0

Democrats 0
are 0
trying 0
to 0
drag 0
the 0
confirmation 0
process 0
into 0
the 0
next 0
Congress 0
where 0
they 0
may 0
seize 0
control 0
from 0
Republicans. 0

Election 0
Day 0
is 0
November 0
6. 0

The 0
GOP 0
currently 0
controls 0
the 0
Senate, 0
which 0
has 0
the 0
final 0
say 0
on 0
judicial 0
nominations, 0
by 0
an 0
uncomfortably 0
close 0
margin 0
of 0
51 0
to 0
49. 0

The 0
proceedings 0
Thursday 0
are 0
supposed 0
to 0
get 0
underway 0
at 0
10:00 0
a.m. 0
Eastern 0
time. 0

Committee 0
Republicans 0
considered 0
the 0
political 0
optics 0
and 0
didn’t 0
relish 0
the 0
prospect 0
of 0
their 0
all-male 1
team 1
of 0
11 0
senators 0
questioning 0
a 0
woman 0
so 0
they 0
hired 0
sex-crimes 0
prosecutor 0
Rachel 0
Mitchell 0
of 0
Maricopa 0
County, 0
Arizona, 0
to 0
ask 0
the 0
questions 0
at 0
what 0
promises 0
to 0
be 0
a 0
highly-watched 0
hearing. 0

Democrats 0
predictably 0
freaked 1
out 1
at 0
the 0
decision 0
to 0
have 0
a 0
woman 0
lead 0
the 0
questioning 0
since 0
their 0
primary 0
objective 0
here 0
is 0
to 0
embarrass 0
and 0
discredit 0
Kavanaugh 0
and 0
other 0
Republicans, 0
not 0
get 0
at 0
the 0
truth. 0

“It 0
is 0
going 0
against 0
everything 0
I’ve 0
seen 0
for 0
44 0
years," 0
huffed 0
committee 0
member 0
Patrick 0
Leahy 0
(D-Vt.). 0

"They’re 0
not 0
following 0
normal 0
procedure." 0

As 0
expected, 0
at 0
today’s 0
hearing 0
Kavanaugh 0
will 0
firmly 0
rebut 0
the 0
increasingly 0
outrageous 0
claims 0
being 0
leveled 0
at 0
him. 0

According 0
to 0
prepared 0
testimony 0
provided 0
to 0
The 0
Hill 0
newspaper, 0
he 0
will 0
say: 0

I 0
categorically 1
and 1
unequivocally 1
deny 1
the 0
allegation 0
against 0
me 0
by 0
Dr. 0
Ford. 0

I 0
never 0
had 0
any 0
sexual 0
or 0
physical 0
encounter 0
of 0
any 0
kind 0
with 0
Dr. 0
Ford. 0

I 0
am 0
not 0
questioning 0
that 0
Dr. 0
Ford 0
may 0
have 0
been 0
sexually 0
assaulted 0
by 0
some 0
person 0
in 0
some 0
place 0
at 0
some 0
time. 0

But 0
I 0
have 0
never 0
done 0
that 0
to 0
her 0
or 0
to 0
anyone. 0

Kavanaugh 0
added: 0
"I 0
am 0
innocent 0
of 0
this 0
charge." 0

Not 0
surprisingly 0
Ford’s 0
prepared 0
testimony 0
also 0
found 0
its 0
way 0
to 0
reporters. 0

“I 0
am 0
here 0
today 0
not 0
because 0
I 0
want 0
to 0
be,” 0
Ford 0
says 0
in 0
her 0
opening 0
statement. 0

“I 0
am 1
terrified. 1

I 0
am 0
here 0
because 0
I 0
believe 0
it 0
is 0
my 0
civic 0
duty 0
to 0
tell 0
you 0
what 0
happened 0
to 0
me 0
while 0
Brett 0
Kavanaugh 0
and 0
I 0
were 0
in 0
high 0
school.” 0

She 0
describes 0
the 0
nominee 0
as 0
“Brett 1
Kavanaugh, 1
the 1
boy 1
who 1
sexually 1
assaulted 1
me,” 1
and 0
claims 0
“Brett’s 0
assault 0
on 0
me 0
drastically 1
altered 1
my 1
life,” 1
but 0
at 0
the 0
same 0
time 0
acknowledges 0
“Brett 0
did 0
not 0
rape 0
me.” 0

Given 0
that 0
Kavanaugh 0
has 0
already 0
passed 0
six 0
incredibly 0
intrusive 0
FBI 0
investigations, 0
odds 0
are 0
Ford 1
is 1
lying 1
or 1
suffering 1
from 1
some 1
kind 1
of 1
psychological 1
disorder 1
such 1
as 1
false 1
memory 1
syndrome. 1

Many 0
commentators 0
have 0
drawn 0
parallels 0
between 0
Ford 0
and 0
Anita 0
Hill, 0
who 0
in 0
1991 0
accused 0
then-Supreme 0
Court 0
nominee 0
Clarence 0
Thomas 0
of 0
sexual 0
improprieties. 0

Both 0
women 0
are 0
college 0
professors. 0

Both 0
claim 0
to 0
have 0
reluctantly 0
been 0
drawn 0
into 0
confirmation 0
battles. 0

Ford 0
claims 0
to 0
be 0
a 0
victim 0
of 0
attempted 0
rape; 0
Hill 0
claims 0
to 0
have 0
been 0
a 0
victim 0
of 0
sexual 0
harassment 0
in 0
the 0
workplace. 0

Only 0
left-wingers 1
and 1
feminists 1
like 1
Maureen 1
Dowd 1
still 0
believe 0
Hill, 0
now 0
an 0
utterly 1
undistinguished 1
politically 1
correct 1
scholar 1
who 0
discredited 0
herself 0
by 0
–among 0
other 0
things— 0
following 0
her 0
then-boss 0
Thomas 0
as 0
his 0
subordinate 0
when 0
he 0
switched 0
jobs. 0

An 0
abused 0
person 0
wouldn’t 0
do 0
that. 0

But 0
all 0
the 0
lies 0
about 0
Thomas 0
at 0
what 0
he 0
described 0
as 0
a 0
“high-tech 1
lynching 1
for 1
uppity 1
blacks” 1
had 0
an 0
effect. 0

In 0
the 0
end, 0
the 0
Senate 0
barely 0
approved 0
his 0
nomination 0
52 0
to 0
48 0
on 0
October 0
15, 0
1991. 0

With 0
all 0
the 0
mud 1
Democrats 1
have 1
been 1
slinging 1
at 1
Kavanaugh, 0
he 0
would 0
be 0
thrilled 0
to 0
be 0
approved 0
by 0
a 0
margin 0
as 0
wide 0
as 0
52 0
to 0
48. 0

Conservatives 0
need 0
to 0
remember 0
that 0
the 1
purpose 1
of 1
the 1
Left’s 1
frenzied, 1
demagogic 1
assault 1
is 1
to 1
damage 1
the 1
nominee, 1
and 1
by 1
extension, 1
the 1
president 1
who 1
nominated 1
him. 1

If 0
they 0
can 0
derail 0
Kavanaugh’s 0
nomination, 0
that 0
is 0
an 0
added 0
bonus. 0

The 0
Left’s 0
attacks 0
on 0
