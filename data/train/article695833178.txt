That’s 0
right, 0
photographic 0
evidence 0
from 0
inside 0
the 0
hotel 0
parking 0
garage 0
has 0
confirmed 0
that 0
the 0
FBI, 0
along 0
with 0
state 0
and 0
local 0
police, 0
specifically 0
lied 0
about 0
key 0
details 0
of 0
the 0
shooting. 0

This 1
throws 1
their 1
entire 1
narrative 1
into 1
question 1
and 1
makes 1
one 1
wonder 1
what 1
else 1
is 1
being 1
hidden 1
from 1
the 1
public? 1

Keep 0
in 0
mind 0
that 0
at 0
least 0
four 0
videos 0
from 0
the 0
scene 0
of 0
the 0
shooting 0
have 0
already 0
been 0
released 0
that 0
indicate 0
there 0
were 0
multiple 0
shooters. 0

In 0
fact, 0
there 0
are 0
so 0
many 0
unanswered 0
questions 0
that 0
the 0
Drudge 0
Report 0
even 0
linked 0
to 0
an 0
article 0
asking 0
them 0
directly. 0

As 0
noted 0
above, 0
at 0
this 0
point 0
literally 0
every 0
piece 0
of 0
so-called 1
evidence 1
put 0
forth 0
by 0
authorities 0
and 0
then 0
regurgitated 0
by 0
the 0
mainstream 0
media 0
cannot 1
be 1
trusted 1
and 1
should 1
be 1
considered 1
as 1
disinformation 1
until 0
proven 0
otherwise. 0

And 0
if 0
Paddock 0
really 0
did 0
act 0
alone 0
and 0
this 0
evidence 0
is 0
some 0
sort 0
of 0
mistake, 0
there 0
is 0
surely 0
video 0
footage 0
proving 0
so. 0
