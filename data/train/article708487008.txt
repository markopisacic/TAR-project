An 0 94 2
expert 0 94 2
is 0 94 2
warning 1 94 2
the 1 94 2
plague 1 94 2
that 1 94 2
has 1 94 2
sickened 1 94 2
over 1 94 2
2000 1 94 2
people 1 94 2
in 1 94 2
Madagascar 1 94 2
since 1 94 2
August 1 94 2
is 1 94 2
impossible 1 94 2
to 1 94 2
eradicate. 1 94 2

Even 0 94 3
though 0 94 3
the 0 94 3
number 0 94 3
of 0 94 3
those 0 94 3
infected 0 94 3
has 0 94 3
dropped 0 94 3
in 0 94 3
recent 0 94 3
weeks, 0 94 3
the 1 94 3
plague 1 94 3
will 1 94 3
never 1 94 3
truly 1 94 3
be 1 94 3
gone. 1 94 3

Since 0 94 4
the 0 94 4
airborne 0 94 4
version 0 94 4
of 0 94 4
the 0 94 4
plague 0 94 4
can 0 94 4
kill 0 94 4
a 0 94 4
person 0 94 4
in 0 94 4
just 0 94 4
three 0 94 4
hours, 0 94 4
experts 0 94 4
warn 0 94 4
that 0 94 4
its 0 94 4
too 0 94 4
soon 0 94 4
to 0 94 4
think 0 94 4
that 0 94 4
since 0 94 4
there 0 94 4
hasn’t 0 94 4
been 0 94 4
a 0 94 4
person 0 94 4
infected 0 94 4
in 0 94 4
recent 0 94 4
days, 0 94 4
that 0 94 4
it 0 94 4
won’t 0 94 4
pop 0 94 4
up 0 94 4
again. 0 94 4

That’s 0 94 5
because 0 94 5
the 1 94 5
bacteria 1 94 5
that 1 94 5
causes 1 94 5
plague 1 94 5
is 1 94 5
now 1 94 5
so 1 94 5
widespread 1 94 5
in 1 94 5
wildlife, 1 94 5
that 1 94 5
humans 1 94 5
can’t 1 94 5
do 1 94 5
anything 1 94 5
to 1 94 5
get 1 94 5
rid 1 94 5
of 1 94 5
it, 1 94 5
