An 0
expert 0
is 0
warning 1
the 1
plague 1
that 1
has 1
sickened 1
over 1
2000 1
people 1
in 1
Madagascar 1
since 1
August 1
is 1
impossible 1
to 1
eradicate. 1

Even 0
though 0
the 0
number 0
of 0
those 0
infected 0
has 0
dropped 0
in 0
recent 0
weeks, 0
the 1
plague 1
will 1
never 1
truly 1
be 1
gone. 1

Since 0
the 0
airborne 0
version 0
of 0
the 0
plague 0
can 0
kill 0
a 0
person 0
in 0
just 0
three 0
hours, 0
experts 0
warn 0
that 0
its 0
too 0
soon 0
to 0
think 0
that 0
since 0
there 0
hasn’t 0
been 0
a 0
person 0
infected 0
in 0
recent 0
days, 0
that 0
it 0
won’t 0
pop 0
up 0
again. 0

That’s 0
because 0
the 1
bacteria 1
that 1
causes 1
plague 1
is 1
now 1
so 1
widespread 1
in 1
wildlife, 1
that 1
humans 1
can’t 1
do 1
anything 1
to 1
get 1
rid 1
of 1
it, 1

“It’s 1
not 1
possible 1
to 1
eradicate 1
plague, 1
as 0
it 0
is 0
widespread 0
in 0
wildlife 0

“Outbreaks, 0
generally, 0
are 0
managed 0
reactively 0
by 0
‘firefighting 0
teams’, 0
deployed 0

A 0
more 0
preventative 0
approach, 0
such 0
as 0
the 0
identification 0
of 0
areas 0
at 0
risk 0
using 0
climate 0
models 0

animal 0

to 0

flea 0
and 0
rat 0
control 0
efforts, 0
would 0
be 0
better,” 0

“But, 0
this 0
requires 0
a 0
better 0
understanding 0
of 0
transmission 0
pathways 0
in 0
each 0
region 0
where 0

persists.” 0

The 0
best 0
way 0
to 0
stop 0
the 0
plague 0
spreading 0
was 0
to 0
focus 0
on 0
flea 0
