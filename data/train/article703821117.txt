one 0 54 1
thing 0 54 1
is 0 54 1
for 0 54 1
sure: 0 54 1
The 1 54 1
cover-up 1 54 1
of 1 54 1
this 1 54 1
particular 1 54 1
U.S. 1 54 1
regime-change 1 54 1
operation 1 54 1
was 0 54 1
one 1 54 1
of 1 54 1
the 1 54 1
most 1 54 1
ingenious 1 54 1
and 1 54 1
cunning 1 54 1
plots 1 54 1
ever 1 54 1

This 0 54 2
shouldn’t 0 54 2
surprise 0 54 2
anyone, 0 54 2
given 0 54 2
that 0 54 2
practically 0 54 2
from 0 54 2
its 0 54 2
inception 0 54 2
in 0 54 2
1947 0 54 2
the 0 54 2
CIA 0 54 2
was 0 54 2
specializing 0 54 2
in 0 54 2
the 0 54 2
arts 0 54 2
of 0 54 2
assassination, 0 54 2

As 0 54 3
far 0 54 3
back 0 54 3
as 0 54 3
1953, 0 54 3
the 0 54 3
CIA 0 54 3
published 0 54 3
an 0 54 3
assassination 0 54 3
manual 0 54 3
that 0 54 3
the 1 54 3
CIA 1 54 3
succeeded 1 54 3
in 1 54 3
keeping 1 54 3
secret 1 54 3
from 1 54 3
the 1 54 3
American 1 54 3
people 1 54 3
for 0 54 3
more 0 54 3
than 0 54 3
40 0 54 3
years. 0 54 3

It 0 54 4
came 0 54 4
to 0 54 4
light 0 54 4
in 0 54 4
1997 0 54 4
as 0 54 4
a 0 54 4

also 0 54 13
makes 0 54 13
it 0 54 13
clear 0 54 13
that 0 54 13
the 0 54 13

Note 0 54 14
the 0 54 14
following 0 54 14
excerpt: 0 54 14

For 0 54 15
secret 0 54 15
assassination, 0 54 15
either 0 54 15
simple 0 54 15
or 0 54 15
chase, 0 54 15
the 0 54 15
contrived 0 54 15
accident 0 54 15
is 0 54 15
the 0 54 15
most 0 54 15
effective 0 54 15
technique. 0 54 15

When 0 54 16
successfully 0 54 16
executed, 0 54 16
it 0 54 16
causes 0 54 16
little 0 54 16
excitement 0 54 16
and 0 54 16
is 0 54 16
only 0 54 16
casually 0 54 16
investigated. 0 54 16

It 0 54 17
would 0 54 17
be 0 54 17
safe 0 54 17
to 0 54 17
assume 0 54 17
that 0 54 17
the 0 54 17
CIA 0 54 17
continued 0 54 17
developing 0 54 17
and 0 54 17
expanding 0 54 17
on 0 54 17
the 0 54 17
assassination 0 54 17
principles 0 54 17
enunciated 0 54 17
in 0 54 17
that 0 54 17
early 0 54 17
assassination 0 54 17
manual. 0 54 17

That’s 0 54 18
what 0 54 18
we 0 54 18
would 0 54 18
expect 0 54 18
from 0 54 18
an 0 54 18
agency 0 54 18
whose 0 54 18
specialties 0 54 18
included 0 54 18
assassination. 0 54 18

We 0 54 19
can 0 54 19
also 0 54 19
assume 0 54 19
that 0 54 19
the 0 54 19
CIA 0 54 19
continued 0 54 19
to 0 54 19
refine 0 54 19
the 0 54 19
ways 0 54 19
to 0 54 19
avoid 0 54 19

The 0 54 21
CIA 0 54 21
published 0 54 21
that 0 54 21
secret 0 54 21
assassination 0 54 21
manual 0 54 21
as 0 54 21
part 0 54 21
of 0 54 21
its 0 54 21
preparations 0 54 21
for 0 54 21
a 0 54 21
U.S. 0 54 21
regime-change 0 54 21
operation 0 54 21
in 0 54 21
Guatemala, 0 54 21
one 0 54 21
that 0 54 21
was 0 54 21
designed 0 54 21
to 0 54 21
violently 1 54 21
remove 1 54 21
the 0 54 21
nation’s 0 54 21
democratically 0 54 21
elected 0 54 21
socialist 0 54 21
president, 0 54 21
Jacobo 0 54 21
Arbenz, 0 54 21
from 0 54 21
office 0 54 21
and 0 54 21
replace 0 54 21
him 0 54 21
with 0 54 21
an 0 54 21
unelected, 1 54 21
right-wing, 1 54 21
pro-U.S. 1 54 21
military 1 54 21
general. 1 54 21

As 0 54 22
part 0 54 22
of 0 54 22
the 0 54 22
Guatemala 0 54 22
regime-change 0 54 22
operation, 0 54 22
the 0 54 22
CIA 0 54 22
prepared 0 54 22
a 0 54 22
list 0 54 22
of 0 54 22
Guatemalan 0 54 22
officials 0 54 22
to 0 54 22
be 0 54 22
assassinated. 0 54 22

While 0 54 23
the 0 54 23
CIA 0 54 23
has 0 54 23
never 0 54 23
revealed 0 54 23
the 0 54 23
names 0 54 23
of 0 54 23
the 0 54 23
people 0 54 23
it 0 54 23
targeted 0 54 23
for 0 54 23
assassination, 0 54 23
there 0 54 23
is 0 54 23
little 0 54 23
doubt 0 54 23
that 0 54 23
Arbenz, 0 54 23
the 0 54 23
president, 0 54 23
was 0 54 23
at 0 54 23
the 0 54 23
top 0 54 23
of 0 54 23
the 0 54 23
list. 0 54 23

There 0 54 24
is 0 54 24
something 0 54 24
important 0 54 24
to 0 54 24
note: 0 54 24
Neither 0 54 24
Arbenz 0 54 24
nor 0 54 24
any 0 54 24
other 0 54 24
Guatemalan 0 54 24
official 0 54 24
had 0 54 24
ever 0 54 24
attacked 0 54 24
the 0 54 24
United 0 54 24
States 0 54 24
or 0 54 24
even 0 54 24
threatened 0 54 24
to 0 54 24
do 0 54 24
so. 0 54 24

So, 0 54 25
why 0 54 25
were 0 54 25
they 0 54 25
targeted 0 54 25
for 0 54 25
assassination? 0 54 25

Because 0 54 26
Arbenz 0 54 26
had 0 54 26
reached 0 54 26
out 0 54 26
to 0 54 26
the 0 54 26
Russians 0 54 26
and 0 54 26
Cubans 0 54 26
in 0 54 26
a 0 54 26
spirit 0 54 26
of 0 54 26
peace 0 54 26
and 0 54 26
friendship, 0 54 26
just 0 54 26
as 0 54 26
John 0 54 26
Kennedy 0 54 26
would 0 54 26
do 0 54 26
ten 0 54 26
years 0 54 26
later. 0 54 26

That’s 0 54 27
why 0 54 27
the 0 54 27
CIA 0 54 27
targeted 0 54 27
Guatemala 0 54 27
for 0 54 27
regime 0 54 27
change 0 54 27
and 0 54 27
why 0 54 27
it 0 54 27
targeted 0 54 27
Arbenz 0 54 27
and 0 54 27
other 0 54 27
Guatemalan 0 54 27
officials 0 54 27
for 0 54 27
assassination. 0 54 27

Although 0 54 28
Arbenz 0 54 28
was 0 54 28
able 0 54 28
to 0 54 28
escape 0 54 28
the 0 54 28
country, 0 54 28
the 0 54 28
CIA’s 0 54 28
regime-change 0 54 28
operation 0 54 28
was 0 54 28
a 1 54 28
total 1 54 28
success, 1 54 28
with 0 54 28
Arbenz 0 54 28
being 0 54 28
replaced 0 54 28
by 0 54 28
the 0 54 28
pro-U.S. 0 54 28
Gen. 0 54 28
Carlos 0 54 28
Castillo 0 54 28
Armas, 0 54 28
who 0 54 28
proceeded 0 54 28
to 0 54 28
instigate 0 54 28
a 1 54 28
reign 1 54 28
of 1 54 28
terror 1 54 28
across 0 54 28
Guatemala. 0 54 28

The 1 54 29
Guatemalan 1 54 29
operation 1 54 29
was 1 54 29
brilliant 1 54 29
and 1 54 29
ingenious. 1 54 29

The 0 54 30
CIA 0 54 30
officials 0 54 30
were 0 54 30
secretly 0 54 30
honored 0 54 30
for 0 54 30
protecting 0 54 30
“national 0 54 30
security” 0 54 30
by 0 54 30
removing 0 54 30
President 0 54 30
Arbenz 0 54 30
from 0 54 30
office 0 54 30
and 0 54 30
replacing 0 54 30
him 0 54 30
with 0 54 30
a 0 54 30
pro-U.S. 0 54 30
military 0 54 30
general. 0 54 30

Tracy 0 54 31
Barnes, 0 54 31
one 0 54 31
of 0 54 31
the 0 54 31
CIA 0 54 31
officials 0 54 31
responsible 0 54 31
for 0 54 31
the 0 54 31
operation, 0 54 31
was 0 54 31
awarded 0 54 31
the 0 54 31
Distinguished 0 54 31
Intelligence 0 54 31
Medal, 0 54 31
the 0 54 31
CIA’s 0 54 31
second-highest 0 54 31
medal. 0 54 31

The 1 54 32
CIA’s 1 54 32
cover-up 1 54 32
in 1 54 32
the 1 54 32
JFK 1 54 32
assassination 1 54 32
was 1 54 32
even 1 54 32
more 1 54 32
brilliant 1 54 32
and 1 54 32
ingenious. 1 54 32

The 0 54 33
doctors 0 54 33
at 0 54 33
Parkland 0 54 33
Hospital 0 54 33
stated 0 54 33
that 0 54 33
President 0 54 33
Kennedy 0 54 33
had 0 54 33
a 0 54 33
big 0 54 33
exit-sized 0 54 33
wound 0 54 33
in 0 54 33
the 0 54 33
back 0 54 33
of 0 54 33
his 0 54 33
head, 0 54 33
which 0 54 33
implied 0 54 33
a 0 54 33
shot 0 54 33
having 0 54 33
been 0 54 33
fired 0 54 33
from 0 54 33
the 0 54 33
front. 0 54 33

At 0 54 34
a 0 54 34
press 0 54 34
conference 0 54 34
immediately 0 54 34
after 0 54 34
the 0 54 34
president 0 54 34
died, 0 54 34
two 0 54 34
treating 0 54 34
physicians 0 54 34
stated 0 54 34
that 0 54 34
the 0 54 34
other 0 54 34
wound 0 54 34
— 0 54 34
the 0 54 34
one 0 54 34
in 0 54 34
the 0 54 34
front 0 54 34
of 0 54 34
Kennedy’s 0 54 34
neck 0 54 34
— 0 54 34
was 0 54 34
an 0 54 34
entry 0 54 34
wound, 0 54 34
which 0 54 34
implied 0 54 34
that 0 54 34
Kennedy 0 54 34
had 0 54 34
been 0 54 34
hit 0 54 34
by 0 54 34
another 0 54 34
shot 0 54 34
fired 0 54 34
from 0 54 34
the 0 54 34
front. 0 54 34

This 0 54 35
necessarily 0 54 35
meant 0 54 35
that 0 54 35
Kennedy 0 54 35
had 0 54 35
been 0 54 35
shot 0 54 35
from 0 54 35
the 0 54 35
front, 0 54 35
not 0 54 35
the 0 54 35
rear, 0 54 35
where 0 54 35
accused 0 54 35
assassin 0 54 35
Lee 0 54 35
Harvey 0 54 35
Oswald 0 54 35
was 0 54 35
situated. 0 54 35

Keep 0 54 36
in 0 54 36
mind 0 54 36
something 0 54 36
important: 0 54 36
After 0 54 36
he 0 54 36
was 0 54 36
arrested, 0 54 36
Oswald 0 54 36
claimed 0 54 36
his 0 54 36
innocence. 0 54 36

But 0 54 37
he 0 54 37
also 0 54 37
went 0 54 37
a 0 54 37
step 0 54 37
further. 0 54 37

He 0 54 38
said 0 54 38
that 0 54 38
he 0 54 38
was 0 54 38
being 0 54 38
framed 0 54 38
for 0 54 38
the 0 54 38
crime. 0 54 38

The 0 54 39
obvious 0 54 39
question 0 54 39
arises: 0 54 39
Why 0 54 39
frame 0 54 39
an 0 54 39
innocent 0 54 39
man 0 54 39
who 0 54 39
is 0 54 39
situated 0 54 39
in 0 54 39
the 0 54 39
rear 0 54 39
by 0 54 39
killing 0 54 39
the 0 54 39
president 0 54 39
with 0 54 39
shots 0 54 39
fired 0 54 39
from 0 54 39
the 0 54 39
front? 0 54 39

Wouldn’t 0 54 40
it 0 54 40
be 0 54 40
more 0 54 40
logical 0 54 40
to 0 54 40
either 0 54 40
have 0 54 40
the 0 54 40
shots 0 54 40
fired 0 54 40
from 0 54 40
the 0 54 40
rear, 0 54 40
where 0 54 40
Oswald 0 54 40
was, 0 54 40
or, 0 54 40
alternatively, 0 54 40
place 0 54 40
Oswald 0 54 40
in 0 54 40
the 0 54 40
front, 0 54 40
where 0 54 40
the 0 54 40
shots 0 54 40
were 0 54 40
fired? 0 54 40

That’s 0 54 41
where 0 54 41
the 1 54 41
brilliance, 1 54 41
ingenuity, 1 54 41
and 1 54 41
cunningness 1 54 41
of 1 54 41
the 1 54 41
cover-up 1 54 41
come 0 54 41
into 0 54 41
play. 0 54 41

If 0 54 42
Oswald 0 54 42
is 0 54 42
in 0 54 42
the 0 54 42
rear 0 54 42
and 0 54 42
since 0 54 42
shots 0 54 42
are 0 54 42
fired 0 54 42
from 0 54 42
the 0 54 42
front, 0 54 42
that 0 54 42
could 0 54 42
mean 0 54 42
only 0 54 42
one 0 54 42
thing: 0 54 42
that 0 54 42
Oswald 0 54 42
had 0 54 42
confederates 0 54 42
firing 0 54 42
from 0 54 42
the 0 54 42
front. 0 54 42

Who 0 54 43
would 0 54 43
those 0 54 43
confederates 0 54 43
be? 0 54 43

There 1 54 44
could 1 54 44
be 1 54 44
only 1 54 44
one 1 54 44
answer: 1 54 44
communists. 1 54 44

Soviet 1 54 45
and 1 54 45
Cuban 1 54 45
communists, 1 54 45
to 1 54 45
be 1 54 45
more 1 54 45
specific. 1 54 45

How 0 54 46
would 0 54 46
we 0 54 46
know 0 54 46
this? 0 54 46

That’s 0 54 47
where 0 54 47
Oswald’s 0 54 47
trip 0 54 47
to 0 54 47
Mexico 0 54 47
City 0 54 47
right 0 54 47
before 0 54 47
the 0 54 47
assassination 0 54 47
comes 0 54 47
into 0 54 47
play. 0 54 47

Oswald 0 54 49
traveled 0 54 49
to 0 54 49
Mexico 0 54 49
City 0 54 49
where 0 54 49
he 0 54 49
purportedly 0 54 49
visited 0 54 49
the 0 54 49
Soviet 0 54 49
and 0 54 49
Cuban 0 54 49
embassies 0 54 49
and 0 54 49
where 0 54 49
he 0 54 49
supposedly 0 54 49
met 0 54 49
with 0 54 49
a 0 54 49
premier 0 54 49
assassin 0 54 49
for 0 54 49
the 0 54 49
Soviet 0 54 49
Union. 0 54 49

Keep 0 54 50
in 0 54 50
mind 0 54 50
that 0 54 50
this 0 54 50
was 0 54 50
the 0 54 50
height 0 54 50
of 0 54 50
the 0 54 50
Cold 0 54 50
War 0 54 50
between 0 54 50
the 0 54 50
United 0 54 50
States 0 54 50
and 0 54 50
that 0 54 50
the 0 54 50
Cuban 0 54 50
Missile 0 54 50
Crisis, 0 54 50
which 0 54 50
brought 0 54 50
the 0 54 50
world 0 54 50
to 0 54 50
the 0 54 50
brink 0 54 50
of 0 54 50
nuclear 0 54 50
war, 0 54 50
had 0 54 50
taken 0 54 50
place 0 54 50
the 0 54 50
previous 0 54 50
year. 0 54 50

So, 0 54 51
President 0 54 51
Kennedy 0 54 51
has 0 54 51
been 0 54 51
assassinated. 0 54 51

Oswald 0 54 52
is 0 54 52
immediately 0 54 52
arrested. 0 54 52

He 0 54 53
has 0 54 53
confederates 0 54 53
firing 0 54 53
from 0 54 53
the 0 54 53
front, 0 54 53
who 1 54 53
almost 1 54 53
certainly 1 54 53
are 1 54 53
Soviet 1 54 53
and 1 54 53
Cuban 1 54 53
communists, 1 54 53
especially 0 54 53
since 0 54 53
Oswald 0 54 53
has 0 54 53
supposedly 0 54 53
just 0 54 53
recently 0 54 53
visited 0 54 53
the 0 54 53
Soviet 0 54 53
and 0 54 53
Cuban 0 54 53
embassies 0 54 53
in 0 54 53
Mexico 0 54 53
City. 0 54 53

What 0 54 54
does 0 54 54
all 0 54 54
that 0 54 54
mean? 0 54 54

An 0 54 55
assassination 0 54 55
of 0 54 55
the 0 54 55
president 0 54 55
by 0 54 55
the 0 54 55
Soviet 0 54 55
Union 0 54 55
and 0 54 55
Cuba 0 54 55
is 0 54 55
obviously 0 54 55
an 0 54 55
act 0 54 55
of 0 54 55
war. 0 54 55

That 0 54 56
means 0 54 56
nuclear 0 54 56
war 0 54 56
is 0 54 56
about 0 54 56
to 0 54 56
break 0 54 56
out 0 54 56
because 0 54 56
there 0 54 56
is 0 54 56
no 0 54 56
way 0 54 56
that 0 54 56
the 0 54 56
United 0 54 56
States 0 54 56
is 0 54 56
going 0 54 56
to 0 54 56
sit 0 54 56
idly 0 54 56
by 0 54 56
when 0 54 56
the 1 54 56
Reds 1 54 56
have 0 54 56
just 0 54 56
assassinated 0 54 56
America’s 0 54 56
president. 0 54 56

Except 0 54 57
for 0 54 57
one 0 54 57
thing: 0 54 57
The 1 54 57
communist 1 54 57
part 1 54 57
and 1 54 57
the 1 54 57
nuclear-war 1 54 57
part 1 54 57
were 1 54 57
concocted. 1 54 57

That 1 54 58
was 1 54 58
all 1 54 58
part 1 54 58
of 1 54 58
the 1 54 58
plan. 1 54 58

That 0 54 59
was 0 54 59
the 1 54 59
ingenious 1 54 59
way 1 54 59
that 0 54 59
the 0 54 59
CIA 0 54 59
was 0 54 59
able 0 54 59
to 0 54 59
get 0 54 59
the 0 54 59
investigation 0 54 59
into 0 54 59
the 0 54 59
assassination 0 54 59
squelched 0 54 59
just 0 54 59
as 0 54 59
soon 0 54 59
as 0 54 59
Oswald 0 54 59
was 0 54 59
murdered. 0 54 59

In 0 54 60
the 0 54 60
early 0 54 60
days 0 54 60
of 0 54 60
the 0 54 60
Warren 0 54 60
Commission, 0 54 60
commission 0 54 60
chairman 0 54 60
Earl 0 54 60
Warren 0 54 60
called 0 54 60
a 0 54 60
top-secret 0 54 60
meeting 0 54 60
of 0 54 60
the 0 54 60
commission. 0 54 60

Its 0 54 61
purpose 0 54 61
was 0 54 61
to 0 54 61
discuss 0 54 61
information 0 54 61
that 0 54 61
Warren 0 54 61
had 0 54 61
received 0 54 61
that 0 54 61
Oswald 0 54 61
was 0 54 61
actually 0 54 61
a 0 54 61
U.S. 0 54 61
intelligence 0 54 61
agent 0 54 61
or 0 54 61
an 0 54 61
informant 0 54 61
for 0 54 61
the 0 54 61
FBI 0 54 61
or 0 54 61
both. 0 54 61

How 0 54 62
did 0 54 62
Warren 0 54 62
resolve 0 54 62
this 0 54 62
troubling 0 54 62
issue? 0 54 62

He 0 54 63
simply 0 54 63
asked 0 54 63
the 0 54 63
heads 0 54 63
of 0 54 63
the 0 54 63
CIA 0 54 63
and 0 54 63
FBI 0 54 63
whether 0 54 63
it 0 54 63
was 0 54 63
true. 0 54 63

They 0 54 64
said 0 54 64
no. 0 54 64

That 0 54 65
was 0 54 65
the 0 54 65
end 0 54 65
of 0 54 65
the 0 54 65
matter. 0 54 65

The 0 54 66
issue 0 54 66
was 0 54 66
so 0 54 66
sensitive 0 54 66
that 0 54 66
Warren 0 54 66
ordered 0 54 66
the 0 54 66
members 0 54 66
of 0 54 66
the 0 54 66
commission 0 54 66
to 1 54 66
never 1 54 66
reveal 1 54 66
the 1 54 66
meeting 1 54 66
to 1 54 66
the 1 54 66
American 1 54 66
people. 1 54 66

He 0 54 67
ordered 0 54 67
all 0 54 67
notes 0 54 67
and 0 54 67
other 0 54 67
written 0 54 67
references 0 54 67
to 0 54 67
be 0 54 67
destroyed. 0 54 67

He 0 54 68
also 0 54 68
ordered 0 54 68
the 0 54 68
court 0 54 68
reporter 0 54 68
to 0 54 68
destroy 0 54 68
her 0 54 68
notes 0 54 68
of 0 54 68
the 0 54 68
meeting. 0 54 68

Unbeknownst 0 54 69
to 0 54 69
him, 0 54 69
the 0 54 69
court 0 54 69
reporter 0 54 69
inadvertently 0 54 69
kept 0 54 69
a 0 54 69
recording 0 54 69
of 0 54 69
the 0 54 69
meeting 0 54 69
that 0 54 69
ultimately 0 54 69
came 0 54 69
to 0 54 69
light. 0 54 69

This 0 54 70
troubling 0 54 70
issue 0 54 70
arose 0 54 70
again 0 54 70
yesterday, 0 54 70
November 0 54 70
2, 0 54 70
in 0 54 70

my 0 54 71

to 0 54 71
charges 0 54 71
that 0 54 71

Shapira 0 54 79
then 0 54 79
proceeds 0 54 79
to 0 54 79
provide 0 54 79
the 0 54 79
answer 0 54 79
that 0 54 79

gave, 0 54 79

as 0 54 79
he 0 54 79
points 0 54 79
out, 0 54 79
has 0 54 79

HELMS: 0 54 80
Mr. 0 54 80
Belin, 0 54 80
this 0 54 80
question, 0 54 80
and 0 54 80
I 0 54 80
think 0 54 80
you 0 54 80
may 0 54 80
recall 0 54 80
this, 0 54 80
was 0 54 80
raised 0 54 80
at 0 54 80
the 0 54 80
time 0 54 80
and 0 54 80
the 0 54 80
Agency 0 54 80
was 0 54 80
never 0 54 80
able 0 54 80
to 0 54 80
find 0 54 80
any 0 54 80
evidence 0 54 80
whatsoever, 0 54 80
and 0 54 80
we 0 54 80
really 0 54 80
searched 0 54 80
that 0 54 80
it 0 54 80
had 0 54 80
any 0 54 80
contact 0 54 80
with 0 54 80
Lee 0 54 80
Harvey 0 54 80
Oswald. 0 54 80

As 0 54 81
far 0 54 81
as 0 54 81
the 0 54 81
FBI 0 54 81
was 0 54 81
concerned, 0 54 81
my 0 54 81
recollection 0 54 81
is 0 54 81
not 0 54 81
all 0 54 81
that 0 54 81
precise. 0 54 81

I 0 54 82
believe 0 54 82
that 0 54 82
Mr. 0 54 82
Hoover 0 54 82
testified 0 54 82
that 0 54 82
he 0 54 82
had 0 54 82
not 0 54 82
been 0 54 82
an 0 54 82
agent 0 54 82
of 0 54 82
theirs 0 54 82
either. 0 54 82

He 0 54 83
was 0 54 83
certainly 0 54 83
not 0 54 83
an 0 54 83
agent 0 54 83
of 0 54 83
the 0 54 83
CIA. 0 54 83

He 0 54 84
was 0 54 84
certainly 0 54 84
never 0 54 84
used 0 54 84
by 0 54 84
the 0 54 84
CIA. 0 54 84

Whether 0 54 85
any 0 54 85
CIA 0 54 85
officer 0 54 85
ever 0 54 85
talked 0 54 85
to 0 54 85
him 0 54 85
any 0 54 85
place 0 54 85
or 0 54 85
not 0 54 85
I 0 54 85
don’t 0 54 85
know 0 54 85
but 0 54 85
I 0 54 85
certainly 0 54 85
felt 0 54 85
quite 0 54 85
comfortable 0 54 85
— 0 54 85
I 0 54 85
believe 0 54 85
Mr. 0 54 85
[John] 0 54 85
McCone 0 54 85
[a 0 54 85
previous 0 54 85
CIA 0 54 85
director] 0 54 85
was 0 54 85
asked 0 54 85
to 0 54 85
testify 0 54 85
before 0 54 85
the 0 54 85
Commission 0 54 85
on 0 54 85
this 0 54 85
point. 0 54 85

I 0 54 86
believe 0 54 86
he 0 54 86
was 0 54 86
asked 0 54 86
to 0 54 86
testify. 0 54 86

It 0 54 87
was 0 54 87
a 0 54 87
hot 0 54 87
item 0 54 87
anyway 0 54 87
at 0 54 87
the 0 54 87
time. 0 54 87

And 0 54 88
my 0 54 88
recollection 0 54 88
is 0 54 88
that 0 54 88
I 0 54 88
informed 0 54 88
Mr. 0 54 88
McCone 0 54 88
that 0 54 88
we 0 54 88
could 0 54 88
find 0 54 88
no 0 54 88
evidence 0 54 88
that 0 54 88
Oswald 0 54 88
had 0 54 88
any 0 54 88
connection 0 54 88
with 0 54 88
the 0 54 88
CIA. 0 54 88

Shapira 0 54 89
ends 0 54 89
his 0 54 89
article 0 54 89
by 0 54 89
suggesting 0 54 89
that 0 54 89
commentators 1 54 89
should 1 54 89
do 1 54 89
more 1 54 89
complete 1 54 89
research, 1 54 89
maybe 1 54 89
even 1 54 89
use 1 54 89
Google, 1 54 89
before 1 54 89
they 1 54 89
jump 1 54 89
to 1 54 89
conclusions. 1 54 89

But 1 54 90
Shapira 1 54 90
would 1 54 90
be 1 54 90
wise 1 54 90
to 1 54 90
follow 1 54 90
his 1 54 90
own 1 54 90
advice 1 54 90
because 1 54 90
he 1 54 90
himself 1 54 90
is 1 54 90
guilty 1 54 90
of 1 54 90
what 1 54 90
he 1 54 90
accuses 1 54 90
others 1 54 90
of. 1 54 90

That’s 0 54 91
because 0 54 91
he 1 54 91
failed 1 54 91
to 1 54 91
conclude 1 54 91
his 1 54 91
article 1 54 91
with 1 54 91
one 1 54 91
great 1 54 91
big 1 54 91
important 1 54 91
point 1 54 91
about 1 54 91

Director 1 54 91
Richard 1 54 91
Helms. 1 54 91

is 0 54 92

point 1 54 92
that 0 54 92
Shapira, 0 54 92
who, 1 54 92
according 1 54 92
to 1 54 92
his 1 54 92

“enjoys 1 54 92

left 0 54 92
out 0 54 92
of 0 54 92
his 0 54 92
article? 0 54 92

Perjury. 0 54 93

He 0 54 94
left 0 54 94
out 0 54 94
that 0 54 94
former 0 54 94
CIA 0 54 94
Director 0 54 94
Richard 0 54 94
Helms 0 54 94
was 0 54 94
a 1 54 94
perjurer. 1 54 94

A 1 54 95
liar. 1 54 95

A 0 54 96
CIA 0 54 96
official 0 54 96
who 0 54 96
would 0 54 96
tell 0 54 96
falsehoods, 0 54 96
even 0 54 96
under 0 54 96
oath, 0 54 96
whenever 0 54 96
he 0 54 96
felt 0 54 96
that 0 54 96
“national 0 54 96
security” 0 54 96
required 0 54 96
it. 0 54 96

Shapira 1 54 97
failed 1 54 97
to 1 54 97
note 1 54 97
that 1 54 97
Helms 1 54 97
was 1 54 97
convicted 1 54 97
in 1 54 97
a 1 54 97
federal 1 54 97
district 1 54 97

Interesting 0 54 98
enough, 0 54 98
in 0 54 98
the 0 54 98
Chile 0 54 98
regime-change 0 54 98
operation, 0 54 98
the 0 54 98
CIA 0 54 98
and 0 54 98
the 0 54 98
Pentagon 0 54 98
were 0 54 98
telling 0 54 98
their 0 54 98
counterparts 0 54 98
in 0 54 98
the 0 54 98
Chilean 0 54 98
national-security 0 54 98

that 0 54 98
they 0 54 98
had 0 54 98
a 0 54 98
moral 0 54 98
duty 0 54 98
to 0 54 98
violate 0 54 98
their 0 54 98
nation’s 0 54 98

from 0 54 98

The 0 54 99
reason? 0 54 99

Allende 0 54 100
was 0 54 100
reaching 0 54 100
out 0 54 100

of 0 54 100

just 0 54 100
as 0 54 100

Thus, 0 54 102
given 0 54 102
that 0 54 102
Helms 0 54 102
was 0 54 102
an 0 54 102
admitted 1 54 102
perjurer 1 54 102
and 1 54 102

what 0 54 102
value 0 54 102
does 0 54 102
his 0 54 102
denial 0 54 102
that 0 54 102

has 0 54 103
no 0 54 103

at 0 54 103

And 0 54 104
Shapira, 0 54 104
who 1 54 104
“enjoys 1 54 104

Helms’ 0 54 104
proclivity 0 54 104
for 0 54 104
lying 0 54 104
in 0 54 104
his 0 54 104
article. 0 54 104

The 0 54 105
circumstantial 0 54 105
evidence 0 54 105
overwhelmingly 1 54 105
establishes 0 54 105
that 0 54 105
Oswald 0 54 105
was 0 54 105
working 0 54 105
for 0 54 105
U.S. 0 54 105
intelligence. 0 54 105

How 0 54 106
often 0 54 106
have 0 54 106
you 0 54 106
ever 0 54 106
heard 0 54 106
of 0 54 106
a 0 54 106
U.S. 0 54 106
Marine 0 54 106
communist? 0 54 106

If 0 54 107
Oswald 0 54 107
was 0 54 107
a 0 54 107
genuine 0 54 107
communist, 0 54 107
why 0 54 107
would 0 54 107
he 0 54 107
have 0 54 107
joined 0 54 107
the 0 54 107
Marines 0 54 107
in 0 54 107
the 0 54 107
1950s, 0 54 107
given 0 54 107
that 0 54 107
the 0 54 107
Marines 0 54 107
hated 0 54 107
communists 0 54 107
and 0 54 107
had 0 54 107
just 0 54 107
helped 0 54 107
kill 0 54 107
millions 0 54 107
of 0 54 107
them 0 54 107
in 0 54 107
the 0 54 107
Korean 0 54 107
War? 0 54 107

Why 0 54 108
would 0 54 108
a 0 54 108
genuine 0 54 108
communist 0 54 108
want 0 54 108
to 0 54 108
join 0 54 108
an 0 54 108
organization 0 54 108
in 0 54 108
which 0 54 108
he 0 54 108
could 0 54 108
be 0 54 108
ordered, 0 54 108
on 0 54 108
a 0 54 108
moment’s 0 54 108
notice, 0 54 108
to 0 54 108
return 0 54 108
to 0 54 108
Korea 0 54 108
or 0 54 108
be 0 54 108

Vietnam, 0 54 108
Laos, 0 54 108
China, 0 54 108
the 0 54 108

or 0 54 108
Europe 0 54 108
to 0 54 108

Don’t 0 54 109
forget: 0 54 109
this 0 54 109
is 0 54 109
the 0 54 109
height 0 54 109
of 0 54 109
the 0 54 109
Cold 0 54 109
War! 0 54 109

After 0 54 110
Oswald 0 54 110
supposedly 0 54 110
tried 0 54 110
to 0 54 110
“defect” 0 54 110
to 0 54 110
the 0 54 110
Soviet 0 54 110

promised 0 54 110
to 0 54 110

the 0 54 110
Russians 0 54 110
all 0 54 110
the 0 54 110

he 0 54 110
learned 0 54 110
about 0 54 110
in 0 54 110
the 0 54 110

why 0 54 110
would 0 54 110
U.S. 0 54 110

agree 0 54 110
to 0 54 110

wife? 1 54 110

Why 0 54 111
wouldn’t 0 54 111
they 0 54 111
indict 0 54 111
him 0 54 111
or 0 54 111
at 0 54 111
least 0 54 111
haul 0 54 111
him 0 54 111
before 0 54 111
a 0 54 111
federal 0 54 111
grand 0 54 111
jury 0 54 111
to 0 54 111
testify 0 54 111
as 0 54 111
to 0 54 111
what 0 54 111
secrets 0 54 111
he 0 54 111
gave 0 54 111
the 0 54 111
Russians? 0 54 111

Why 0 54 112
wouldn’t 0 54 112
they 0 54 112
harass, 1 54 112
abuse, 1 54 112
humiliate, 1 54 112
persecute, 1 54 112
or 1 54 112
prosecute 1 54 112
him, 1 54 112
like 0 54 112
they 0 54 112
did 0 54 112
to 0 54 112
Martin 0 54 112
Luther 0 54 112
King, 0 54 112
Dalton 0 54 112
Trumbo, 0 54 112
John 0 54 112

Lindh, 0 54 112
Chelsea 0 54 112
Manning, 0 54 112
Edward 0 54 112
Snowden, 0 54 112
and 0 54 112
other 0 54 112
people 0 54 112
they 0 54 112
have 0 54 112
deemed 0 54 112
to 0 54 112
be 0 54 112
communists 0 54 112
or 0 54 112
traitors? 0 54 112

How 0 54 113
is 0 54 113
it 0 54 113
possible 0 54 113
that 0 54 113
Oswald 0 54 113
could 0 54 113
learn 0 54 113
fluent 0 54 113
Russian 0 54 113
while 0 54 113
serving 0 54 113
in 0 54 113
the 0 54 113
U.S. 0 54 113
military 0 54 113
without 0 54 113
having 0 54 113
U.S. 0 54 113
military 0 54 113
tutors 0 54 113
teaching 0 54 113
him? 0 54 113

How 0 54 114
is 0 54 114
it 0 54 114
possible 0 54 114
that 0 54 114
a 0 54 114
veteran 0 54 114
who 0 54 114
embarrasses 0 54 114
the 0 54 114
U.S. 0 54 114
Marine 0 54 114
Corps 0 54 114
by 0 54 114
openly 0 54 114
proselytizing 0 54 114
for 0 54 114
communism 0 54 114
in 0 54 114
New 0 54 114
Orleans 0 54 114
is 0 54 114
able 0 54 114
to 0 54 114
saunter 0 54 114
across 0 54 114
the 0 54 114
Cold 0 54 114
War 0 54 114
stage 0 54 114
of 0 54 114
history, 0 54 114
not 0 54 114
long 0 54 114
after 0 54 114
the 0 54 114
McCarthy 0 54 114
hearings, 0 54 114
without 1 54 114
nary 1 54 114
a 1 54 114
care 1 54 114
in 1 54 114
the 1 54 114
world? 1 54 114

The 1 54 115
answer: 1 54 115
Helms 1 54 115
lied. 1 54 115

There 1 54 116
is 1 54 116
no 1 54 116
reasonable 1 54 116
doubt 1 54 116
that 1 54 116
Oswald 1 54 116
was 1 54 116
a 1 54 116
U.S. 1 54 116
intelligence 1 54 116
agent, 1 54 116
one 0 54 116
who 0 54 116
was 0 54 116
ordered 0 54 116
to 0 54 116
travel 0 54 116
to 0 54 116
Mexico 0 54 116
City 0 54 116
to 0 54 116
set 0 54 116
the 0 54 116
framework 0 54 116
for 0 54 116
his 0 54 116
frame-up. 0 54 116

But 0 54 117
things 0 54 117
obviously 0 54 117
went 0 54 117
dreadfully 1 54 117
wrong 1 54 117
in 0 54 117
Mexico 0 54 117
City, 0 54 117
which 0 54 117
is 0 54 117
why 0 54 117
the 0 54 117
CIA 0 54 117
had 0 54 117
to 0 54 117
shut 0 54 117
down 0 54 117
that 0 54 117
part 0 54 117
of 0 54 117
the 0 54 117
post-assassination 0 54 117
investigation. 0 54 117

Not 0 54 118
surprisingly, 0 54 118
the 0 54 118
CIA’s 0 54 118
Mexico 0 54 118
City 0 54 118
operations 0 54 118
regarding 0 54 118
Oswald 0 54 118
are 0 54 118
among 0 54 118
the 0 54 118
98 0 54 118
percent 0 54 118
of 0 54 118
the 0 54 118
records 0 54 118
that 0 54 118
Trump 0 54 118
and 0 54 118
the 0 54 118
CIA 0 54 118
have 0 54 118
chosen 0 54 118
to 0 54 118
continue 0 54 118
keeping 1 54 118
secret 1 54 118
from 1 54 118
the 1 54 118
American 1 54 118
people, 1 54 118
on 0 54 118
grounds 0 54 118
of 0 54 118
“national 0 54 118
security” 0 54 118
of 0 54 118
course. 0 54 118

Thus, 0 54 119
when 1 54 119
Oswald 1 54 119
was 1 54 119
claiming 1 54 119
that 1 54 119
he 1 54 119
was 1 54 119
being 1 54 119
framed, 1 54 119
there 1 54 119
could 1 54 119
be 1 54 119
only 1 54 119
one 1 54 119
entity 1 54 119
that 1 54 119
he 1 54 119
could 1 54 119
have 1 54 119
been 1 54 119
thinking 1 54 119
about: 1 54 119
the 1 54 119
CIA, 1 54 119
the 0 54 119
agency 0 54 119
whose 0 54 119
officials, 0 54 119
as 0 54 119
former 0 54 119
Washington 0 54 119
Post 0 54 119
investigative 0 54 119
reporter 0 54 119
Jefferson 0 54 119
Morley 0 54 119
has 0 54 119
documented, 0 54 119
were 1 54 119
secretly 1 54 119
monitoring 1 54 119
his 1 54 119
activities 1 54 119
in 1 54 119
the 1 54 119
weeks 1 54 119
leading 1 54 119
up 1 54 119
to 1 54 119
the 1 54 119
assassination, 1 54 119
no 1 54 119
doubt 1 54 119
to 1 54 119
ensure 1 54 119
that 1 54 119
Oswald 1 54 119
had 1 54 119
not 1 54 119
figured 1 54 119
out 1 54 119
what 1 54 119
was 1 54 119
about 1 54 119
to 1 54 119
happen 1 54 119
to 1 54 119
him. 1 54 119

We 0 54 120
can 0 54 120
assume 0 54 120
that 0 54 120
any 0 54 120
frame-up 0 54 120
by 0 54 120
the 0 54 120
CIA 0 54 120
is 0 54 120
going 0 54 120
to 0 54 120
be 0 54 120
good. 0 54 120

The 0 54 121
operation 0 54 121
is 0 54 121
going 0 54 121
to 0 54 121
be 0 54 121
carefully 0 54 121
planned 0 54 121
and 0 54 121
executed. 0 54 121

But 1 54 122
no 1 54 122
plan 1 54 122
is 1 54 122
perfect. 1 54 122

Things 0 54 123
are 0 54 123
inevitably 0 54 123
going 0 54 123
to 0 54 123
go 0 54 123
wrong. 0 54 123

The 0 54 124
pieces 0 54 124
aren’t 0 54 124
going 0 54 124
to 0 54 124
fit 0 54 124
together 0 54 124
perfectly. 0 54 124

The 0 54 125
Mexico 0 54 125
City 0 54 125
operation 0 54 125
is 0 54 125
a 0 54 125
good 0 54 125
example 0 54 125
of 0 54 125
that. 0 54 125

That’s 1 54 126
why 1 54 126
the 1 54 126
CIA 1 54 126
has 1 54 126
to 1 54 126
continue 1 54 126
keeping 1 54 126
those 1 54 126
records 1 54 126
secret. 1 54 126

But 0 54 127
here’s 0 54 127
another 0 54 127
example, 0 54 127
a 0 54 127
small 0 54 127
but 0 54 127
important 0 54 127
one: 0 54 127
Recall 0 54 127
that 0 54 127
Oswald 0 54 127
supposedly 0 54 127
hid 0 54 127
the 0 54 127
rifle 0 54 127
before 0 54 127
he 0 54 127
headed 0 54 127
down 0 54 127
the 0 54 127
steps 0 54 127
from 0 54 127
the 0 54 127
sixth 0 54 127
floor 0 54 127
of 0 54 127
the 0 54 127
school 0 54 127
book 0 54 127
depository. 0 54 127

Ask 0 54 128
yourself: 0 54 128
If 0 54 128
someone 0 54 128
has 0 54 128
just 0 54 128
assassinated 0 54 128
the 0 54 128
president 0 54 128
of 0 54 128
the 0 54 128
United 0 54 128
States, 0 54 128
is 0 54 128
he 0 54 128
really 0 54 128
going 0 54 128
to 0 54 128
take 0 54 128
the 0 54 128
time 0 54 128
to 0 54 128
hide 0 54 128
the 0 54 128
rifle? 0 54 128

What 0 54 129
good 0 54 129
would 0 54 129
that 0 54 129
do? 0 54 129

Wouldn’t 0 54 130
officials 0 54 130
conduct 0 54 130
a 0 54 130
thorough 0 54 130
search 0 54 130
of 0 54 130
the 0 54 130
area? 0 54 130

Wouldn’t 0 54 131
an 0 54 131
assassin 0 54 131
instead 0 54 131
simply 0 54 131
leave 0 54 131
the 0 54 131
rifle 0 54 131
there 0 54 131
and 0 54 131
get 0 54 131
out 0 54 131
of 0 54 131
there 0 54 131
as 0 54 131
soon 0 54 131
as 0 54 131
he 0 54 131
could? 0 54 131

Then 1 54 132
why 1 54 132
the 1 54 132
hidden 1 54 132
rifle? 1 54 132

Because 1 54 133
it’s 1 54 133
consistent 1 54 133
with 1 54 133
a 1 54 133
frame-up. 1 54 133

The 0 54 134
framers 0 54 134
had 0 54 134
to 0 54 134
hide 0 54 134
the 0 54 134
rifle 0 54 134
in 0 54 134
advance 0 54 134
in 0 54 134
a 0 54 134
place 0 54 134
where 0 54 134
no 0 54 134
one 0 54 134
CIA 0 54 134
& 0 54 134
JFK: 0 54 134

Morley 0 54 134
Check 0 54 134
Amazon 0 54 134
for 0 54 134
Pricing. 0 54 134

would 0 54 135
see 0 54 135
it 0 54 135
during 0 54 135
the 0 54 135
morning 0 54 135
of 0 54 135
the 0 54 135
assassination, 0 54 135
which 0 54 135
took 0 54 135
place 0 54 135
after 0 54 135
noon. 0 54 135

No 0 54 136
matter 0 54 136
how 0 54 136
good 0 54 136
a 0 54 136
frame-up 0 54 136
was, 0 54 136
the 0 54 136
CIA 0 54 136
knew 0 54 136
that 0 54 136
it 0 54 136
could 0 54 136
be 0 54 136
detected 0 54 136
with 0 54 136
an 0 54 136
aggressive 0 54 136
investigation. 0 54 136

That’s 0 54 137
where 0 54 137
ingenuity 1 54 137
and 1 54 137
cunning 1 54 137
come 1 54 137
into 1 54 137
play. 1 54 137

They 0 54 138
had 0 54 138
to 0 54 138
figure 0 54 138
out 0 54 138
a 0 54 138
way 0 54 138
to 0 54 138
shut 0 54 138
down 0 54 138
the 0 54 138
investigation 0 54 138
so 0 54 138
that 0 54 138
the 0 54 138
frame-up 0 54 138
would 0 54 138
remain 0 54 138
intact. 0 54 138

That’s 1 54 139
why 1 54 139
they 1 54 139
had 1 54 139
shots 1 54 139
fired 1 54 139
from 1 54 139
the 1 54 139
front 1 54 139
and 1 54 139
placed 1 54 139
Oswald 1 54 139
in 1 54 139
the 1 54 139
rear. 1 54 139

The 0 54 140
idea 0 54 140
was 0 54 140
that 0 54 140
since 0 54 140
an 0 54 140
investigation 0 54 140
would 0 54 140
lead 0 54 140
to 0 54 140
Oswald’s 0 54 140
supposed 0 54 140
communist 0 54 140
confederates 0 54 140
in 0 54 140
the 0 54 140
front, 0 54 140
which 0 54 140
in 0 54 140
turn 0 54 140
would 0 54 140
lead 0 54 140
to 0 54 140
nuclear 0 54 140
war, 0 54 140
the 0 54 140
investigation 0 54 140
had 0 54 140
to 0 54 140
be 0 54 140
shut 0 54 140
down 0 54 140
immediately, 0 54 140
especially 0 54 140
since 0 54 140
it 0 54 140
was 0 54 140
the 0 54 140
CIA 0 54 140
itself 0 54 140
that 0 54 140
had 0 54 140
started 0 54 140
the 0 54 140
assassination 0 54 140
game 0 54 140
by 0 54 140
repeatedly 0 54 140
attempting, 0 54 140
in 0 54 140
partnership 0 54 140
with 0 54 140
the 0 54 140
Mafia, 0 54 140
to 0 54 140
assassinate 0 54 140
Castro. 0 54 140

It 0 54 141
was 0 54 141
one 1 54 141
of 1 54 141
the 1 54 141
most 1 54 141
brilliant 1 54 141
and 1 54 141
cunning 1 54 141
ruses 1 54 141
in 1 54 141
history. 1 54 141

They 0 54 142
get 0 54 142
the 0 54 142
body 0 54 142
out 0 54 142
of 0 54 142
Parkland 0 54 142
by 0 54 142
force, 0 54 142
in 0 54 142
violation 0 54 142
of 0 54 142
Texas 0 54 142
law, 0 54 142
and 0 54 142
put 0 54 142
it 0 54 142
in 0 54 142
the 0 54 142
hands 0 54 142
of 0 54 142
the 0 54 142
military 0 54 142
in 0 54 142
Maryland, 0 54 142
which 0 54 142
conducts 0 54 142
a 1 54 142
secret 1 54 142
fraudulent 1 54 142
and 1 54 142
bogus 1 54 142
autopsy. 1 54 142
