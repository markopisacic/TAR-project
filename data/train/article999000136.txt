whether 0
that 0
would 0
be 0
important 0
for 0
voters 0
to 0
know 0
that 0
or 0
not, 0
Smith 0
said, 0
“That’s 1
not 1
for 1
them 1
to 1
know.” 1

Of 0
course, 0
anyone 0
following 0
what 0
Gillum 0
has 0
been 0
promoting 0
knows 0
he 0
isn't 0
planning 0
on 0
delivering 0
just 0
like 0
many 0
politicians. 0

“So, 0
let’s 0
go 0
back 0
to 0
Mr. 0
Gillum’s 0
platform, 0
right?” 0
said 0
Smith. 0

“Raise 0
the 0
corporate 0
tax 0
in 0
Florida 0
from 0
7 0
to 0
11 0
percent. 0

That 0
will 0

that 0
will 0

What's 0
even 0
more 0
amazing, 0
but 0
not 0
surprising, 0
is 0
that 0
Gillum 0
has 0
claimed 0
that 0
his 0
opponent 0
is 0
a 0
racist, 0
but 0
the 0
video 0
demonstrates 0
the 1
utter 1
racism 1
of 1
Smith, 1
which 0
one 0
can 0
then 0
conclude 0
that 0
Gillum 0
knows 0
about 0
Smith's 0
racism 0
and 0
keeps 0
him 0
on 0
staff 0
anyway. 0

“This 1
is 1
a 1
f***ed 1
up 1
state,” 1
said 0
Smith. 0

“It’s 1
a 1
cracker 1
state.” 1

Smith 0
also 0
stated 0
that 0
the 0
campaign 0
has 0
“to 1
appeal 1
to 1
white 1
guilt.” 1

Good 1
luck 1
with 1
that! 1

It 0
gets 0
worse 0
though. 0

Smith 0
says 0
that 0
Gillum 0
is 1
“a 1
progressive” 1
who 1
is 1
“a 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
crazy, 1
crazy, 1
crazies.” 1

NEW: 0
The 0
honesty 0
of 0
Gillum's 0
campaign 0
staff 0
on 0
undercover 0
video 0
is 0
refreshing, 0
especially 0
when 0
it 0
comes 0
to 0
who 0
the 0
real 0
Andrew 0
Gillum 0
is. 0

While 0
trying 0
to 0
appear 0
as 0
a 0
moderate, 0
"Gillum 0
is 0
a 0
Progressive" 0
