you 0 280 1
want 0 280 1

the 0 280 1

Booth 0 280 1

Before 0 280 2
I 0 280 2
begin, 0 280 2
I 0 280 2
need 0 280 2
to 0 280 2
make 0 280 2
clear 0 280 2
that 0 280 2
the 0 280 2
best 0 280 2
leaders 0 280 2
are 0 280 2
the 0 280 2
best 0 280 2
followers, 0 280 2
and 0 280 2
that 0 280 2
of 0 280 2
the 0 280 2
Christ 0 280 2
(John 0 280 2
14:6). 0 280 2

With 0 280 3
that 0 280 3
said, 0 280 3
Isn't 0 280 3
it 0 280 3
funny 0 280 3
how 0 280 3
things 0 280 3
work 0 280 3
in 0 280 3
this 0 280 3
world, 0 280 3
it 1 280 3
seems 1 280 3
like 1 280 3
when 1 280 3
you 1 280 3
do 1 280 3
the 1 280 3
wrong 1 280 3
thing 1 280 3
before 1 280 3
God 1 280 3
and 1 280 3
man, 1 280 3
somehow 1 280 3
people 1 280 3
seem 1 280 3
to 1 280 3
give 1 280 3
it 1 280 3
a 1 280 3
pass. 1 280 3

Yet, 1 280 4
when 1 280 4
you 1 280 4
begin 1 280 4
to 1 280 4
do 1 280 4
the 1 280 4
right 1 280 4
things 1 280 4
and 1 280 4
obey 1 280 4
God 1 280 4
and 1 280 4
love 1 280 4
man 1 280 4
according 1 280 4
to 1 280 4
the 1 280 4
Word 1 280 4
of 1 280 4
God, 1 280 4
all 1 280 4
of 1 280 4
a 1 280 4
sudden, 1 280 4
the 1 280 4
world 1 280 4
acts 1 280 4
like 1 280 4
you're 1 280 4
doing 1 280 4
something 1 280 4
wrong. 1 280 4

they 0 280 5

calling 0 280 5

up 0 280 5

“The 0 280 5

I 0 280 18
laughingly 0 280 18
replied. 0 280 18

I 0 280 19
said, 0 280 19
"Mom, 0 280 19
when 0 280 19
I 0 280 19
was 0 280 19
in 0 280 19
the 1 280 19

was 0 280 19

anything, 0 280 19
and 0 280 19
no 0 280 19
one 0 280 19
had 0 280 19
a 0 280 19
problem 0 280 19
with 0 280 19
what 0 280 19
I 0 280 19
was 0 280 19
doing, 0 280 19
that 0 280 19
is 0 280 19
until 0 280 19
I 0 280 19
started 0 280 19
to 0 280 19
emulate 0 280 19
(obey) 0 280 19
Jesus 0 280 19
Christ" 0 280 19
(1 0 280 19
John 0 280 19
2:6). 0 280 19

This 0 280 20
reminds 0 280 20
me 0 280 20
of 0 280 20
when 0 280 20
I 0 280 20
gave 0 280 20
a 0 280 20
prayer 0 280 20
at 0 280 20
the 0 280 20
state 0 280 20
capital 0 280 20
in 0 280 20
Minnesota. 0 280 20

After 0 280 21
the 0 280 21
prayer 0 280 21
was 0 280 21
over, 0 280 21
I 0 280 21
had 0 280 21
a 0 280 21
minister 0 280 21
come 0 280 21
up 0 280 21
to 0 280 21
me 0 280 21
and 0 280 21
tell 0 280 21
me 0 280 21
that 0 280 21
I 0 280 21
could 0 280 21
not 0 280 21
be 0 280 21
dropping 0 280 21
the 0 280 21
“J” 0 280 21
(Jesus) 0 280 21
word 0 280 21
in 0 280 21
the 0 280 21
capital. 0 280 21

I 0 280 22
said 0 280 22
that 0 280 22
the 1 280 22
reason 1 280 22
I 1 280 22
dropped 1 280 22
the 1 280 22
“J” 1 280 22
word 1 280 22
was 1 280 22
because 1 280 22
you 1 280 22
haven’t 1 280 22
in 1 280 22
40 1 280 22
years 1 280 22
(Romans 0 280 22

of 0 280 23
public 0 280 23
high 0 280 23
schools 0 280 23
across 0 280 23
the 0 280 23
country 0 280 23
that 0 280 23
we 0 280 23
have 0 280 23
been 0 280 23
going 0 280 23
into 0 280 23

as 0 280 23
to 0 280 23
who 0 280 23
we 0 280 23
are, 0 280 23
and 0 280 23
not 0 280 23
what 0 280 23
the 1 280 23
revisionists 1 280 23
and 1 280 23
propagandists 1 280 23
would 0 280 23
have 0 280 23
them 0 280 23
believe 0 280 23
that 0 280 23
we 0 280 23
are. 0 280 23

We 0 280 24
have 0 280 24
shown 0 280 24
the 0 280 24
young 0 280 24
people 0 280 24
that 0 280 24
abortion 1 280 24
is 1 280 24
murder 1 280 24
and 1 280 24
that 1 280 24
58 1 280 24
million 1 280 24
babies 1 280 24
have 1 280 24
been 1 280 24
murdered 1 280 24
since 1 280 24
1973 1 280 24
under 1 280 24
the 1 280 24
guise 1 280 24
of 1 280 24
woman’s 1 280 24
choice 1 280 24
(Proverbs 0 280 24
6:17). 0 280 24

We 1 280 25
got 1 280 25
kicked 1 280 25
out 1 280 25
of 1 280 25
a 1 280 25
public 1 280 25
school 1 280 25
for 1 280 25
re-enforcing 1 280 25
America’s 1 280 25
value’s 1 280 25
by 1 280 25
teaching 1 280 25
the 1 280 25
US 1 280 25
Constitution. 1 280 25

We 0 280 26
have 0 280 26
taught 0 280 26
that 0 280 26
homosexuality 1 280 26
is 1 280 26
an 1 280 26
abomination, 1 280 26
and 0 280 26
how 0 280 26
it 0 280 26
is 0 280 26
a 0 280 26
felony 0 280 26
in 0 280 26
every 0 280 26
state 0 280 26
in 0 280 26
our 0 280 26
union 0 280 26
(Leviticus 0 280 26
18:22; 0 280 26
20:13; 0 280 26
Jude 0 280 26
1:7). 0 280 26

How 0 280 27
true 0 280 27
Scripture 0 280 27
is 0 280 27
when 0 280 27
it 0 280 27
declares: 0 280 27

“Woe 0 280 28
unto 0 280 28
them 0 280 28
that 0 280 28
call 0 280 28
evil 0 280 28
good, 0 280 28
and 0 280 28
good 0 280 28
evil; 0 280 28
that 0 280 28
put 0 280 28
darkness 0 280 28
for 0 280 28
light, 0 280 28
and 0 280 28
light 0 280 28
for 0 280 28
darkness; 0 280 28
that 0 280 28
put 0 280 28
bitter 0 280 28
for 0 280 28
sweet, 0 280 28
and 0 280 28
sweet 0 280 28
for 0 280 28
bitter!" 0 280 28

No 0 280 29
wonder 0 280 29
why 0 280 29
the 1 280 29
reprobates 1 280 29
and 1 280 29
hypocrites 1 280 29
thought 0 280 29
that 0 280 29
the 0 280 29
Christians 0 280 29
who 0 280 29
were 0 280 29
following 0 280 29
the 0 280 29
living 0 280 29
Christ 0 280 29
were 0 280 29
turning 0 280 29
the 0 280 29
world 0 280 29
upside 0 280 29
down 0 280 29
in 0 280 29
the 0 280 29
book 0 280 29
of 0 280 29
Acts. 0 280 29

They 0 280 30
were, 0 280 30
in 0 280 30
fact, 0 280 30
turning 0 280 30
the 0 280 30
world 0 280 30
right 0 280 30
side 0 280 30
up 0 280 30
(Acts 0 280 30
17:6). 0 280 30

Identifying 0 280 31
the 0 280 31
genuine 0 280 31
from 0 280 31
the 0 280 31
counterfeit 0 280 31

Last 0 280 32
week, 0 280 32
I 0 280 32
had 0 280 32
a 0 280 32
woman 0 280 32
come 0 280 32
up 0 280 32
to 0 280 32
me 0 280 32
at 0 280 32
my 0 280 32
last 0 280 32
meeting 0 280 32
in 0 280 32
Amery, 0 280 32
Wisconsin. 0 280 32

She 0 280 33
said 0 280 33
that 0 280 33
she 0 280 33
did 0 280 33
her 0 280 33
research 0 280 33
on 0 280 33
me 0 280 33
and 0 280 33
said 0 280 33
that 0 280 33
the 0 280 33
media 0 280 33
really 0 280 33
attacked 0 280 33
me. 0 280 33

I 0 280 34
responded 0 280 34
with, 0 280 34
"Of 1 280 34
course 1 280 34
they 1 280 34
did, 1 280 34
and 1 280 34
of 1 280 34
course 1 280 34
they 1 280 34
still 1 280 34
do." 1 280 34

They 1 280 35
are 1 280 35
being 1 280 35
exposed 1 280 35
for 1 280 35
who 1 280 35
they 1 280 35
are 1 280 35
and 1 280 35
they 1 280 35
do 1 280 35
not 1 280 35
like 1 280 35
it. 1 280 35

(John 0 280 36
15:22). 0 280 36

I 0 280 37
told 0 280 37
her 0 280 37
that 0 280 37
there 0 280 37
are 0 280 37
too 0 280 37
many 0 280 37
counterfeits, 1 280 37
self-proclaimed 1 280 37
leaders, 1 280 37
out 0 280 37
there 0 280 37
who 1 280 37
care 1 280 37
more 1 280 37
about 1 280 37
saving 1 280 37
face, 1 280 37
than 1 280 37
they 1 280 37
do 1 280 37
the 1 280 37
souls 1 280 37
of 1 280 37
men 1 280 37
(Luke 1 280 37
19:10), 1 280 37
as 1 280 37
well 1 280 37
as 1 280 37
saving 1 280 37
their 1 280 37
country. 1 280 37

Apparently 0 280 38
they 0 280 38
have 0 280 38
a 0 280 38
reputation 0 280 38
to 0 280 38
keep 0 280 38
up. 0 280 38

Philippians 0 280 39
2:7-9 0 280 39

These 0 280 40
are 0 280 40
those 0 280 40
that 0 280 40
sit 0 280 40
behind 0 280 40
the 0 280 40
status 0 280 40
of 0 280 40
some 0 280 40
sort 0 280 40
of 0 280 40
church 0 280 40
or 0 280 40
political 1 280 40
leader 1 280 40
of 1 280 40
the 1 280 40
pack. 1 280 40

Yet, 1 280 41
you 1 280 41
do 1 280 41
not 1 280 41
see 1 280 41
any 1 280 41
warfare 1 280 41
or 1 280 41
opposition 1 280 41
around 1 280 41
them 1 280 41
and 1 280 41
why? 1 280 41

because 1 280 42
they 1 280 42
have 1 280 42
simply 1 280 42
forsaken 1 280 42
the 1 280 42
cross. 1 280 42

There 0 280 43
is 0 280 43
no 0 280 43
absolutes 0 280 43
with 0 280 43
these 0 280 43
people. 0 280 43

They 1 280 44
are 1 280 44
people 1 280 44
pleasers 1 280 44
and 1 280 44
nothing 1 280 44
more. 1 280 44

After 0 280 45
all 0 280 45
you 0 280 45
can 0 280 45
always 0 280 45
tell 0 280 45
what 0 280 45
a 0 280 45
man 0 280 45
stands 0 280 45
for 0 280 45
by 0 280 45
the 0 280 45
enemies 0 280 45
that 0 280 45
he 0 280 45
has. 0 280 45

They 0 280 46
hide 1 280 46
behind 1 280 46
a 1 280 46
microphone 1 280 46
day 0 280 46
after 0 280 46
day. 0 280 46

Yet, 0 280 47
they 0 280 47
fail 0 280 47
to 0 280 47
confront 0 280 47
the 0 280 47
issues 0 280 47
that 0 280 47
needed 0 280 47
to 0 280 47
be 0 280 47
confronted. 0 280 47

The 1 280 48
reason 1 280 48
they 1 280 48
don't 1 280 48
is 1 280 48
because 1 280 48
they 1 280 48
are 1 280 48
guilty 1 280 48
of 1 280 48
what 1 280 48
they 1 280 48
fail 1 280 48
to 1 280 48
confront! 1 280 48

They 0 280 49
are 0 280 49
paper 1 280 49
tigers. 1 280 49

They 1 280 50
can 1 280 50
write 1 280 50
all 1 280 50
big 1 280 50
and 1 280 50
bad 1 280 50
but 1 280 50
when 1 280 50
it 1 280 50
comes 1 280 50
to 1 280 50
what 1 280 50
someone 1 280 50
else 1 280 50
should 1 280 50
do. 1 280 50

However, 1 280 51
when 1 280 51
it 1 280 51
is 1 280 51
time 1 280 51
for 1 280 51
them 1 280 51
to 1 280 51
put 1 280 51
boots 1 280 51
on 1 280 51
the 1 280 51
ground, 1 280 51
they 1 280 51
are 1 280 51
simply 1 280 51
missing 1 280 51
in 1 280 51
action 1 280 51
(MIA). 1 280 51

These 0 280 52
are 0 280 52
willing 0 280 52
to 1 280 52
live 1 280 52
in 1 280 52
the 1 280 52
freest 1 280 52
country 1 280 52
in 1 280 52
the 1 280 52
world 1 280 52
as 0 280 52
long 0 280 52
as 0 280 52
it 0 280 52
is 0 280 52
not 0 280 52
them 0 280 52
that 0 280 52
have 0 280 52
to 0 280 52
sacrifice 0 280 52
to 0 280 52
maintain 0 280 52
it. 0 280 52

There 0 280 53
is 0 280 53
also 0 280 53
a 0 280 53
group 0 280 53
of 0 280 53
people 0 280 53
out 0 280 53
there 0 280 53
that 0 280 53
have 0 280 53
to 0 280 53
be 0 280 53
friends 0 280 53
with 0 280 53
everyone 0 280 53
(and 0 280 53
have 0 280 53
to 0 280 53
apologize 0 280 53
to 0 280 53
any 0 280 53
that 0 280 53
they 0 280 53
may 0 280 53
have 0 280 53
told 0 280 53
the 0 280 53
truth 0 280 53
lest 0 280 53
they 0 280 53
should 0 280 53
convict 1 280 53
them 1 280 53
unto 1 280 53
godly 1 280 53
repentance 1 280 53
(2 0 280 53
Corinthians 0 280 53
7:10) 0 280 53
as 0 280 53
they 0 280 53
congregate 0 280 53
week 0 280 53
after 0 280 53
week 0 280 53
deceiving 1 280 53
themselves 1 280 53
into 1 280 53
believing 1 280 53
that 1 280 53
they 1 280 53
are 1 280 53
demanding 1 280 53
a 1 280 53
lawful 1 280 53
change 1 280 53
just 1 280 53
as 1 280 53
long 1 280 53
as 1 280 53
it 1 280 53
does 1 280 53
not 1 280 53
offend 1 280 53
anyone 1 280 53
(Matthew 0 280 53
5:10). 0 280 53

As 0 280 54
a 0 280 54
matter 0 280 54
of 0 280 54
fact, 0 280 54
these 1 280 54
counterfeits 1 280 54
will 1 280 54
be 1 280 54
the 1 280 54
first 1 280 54
ones 1 280 54
to 1 280 54
get 1 280 54
angry 1 280 54
with 1 280 54
and 1 280 54
denounce 1 280 54
and 1 280 54
attack 1 280 54
the 1 280 54
ones 1 280 54
that 1 280 54
are 1 280 54
sent 1 280 54
by 1 280 54
the 1 280 54
Spirit 1 280 54
of 1 280 54
God 1 280 54
(Galatians 0 280 54
4:29). 0 280 54

Maybe 0 280 55
this 0 280 55
group 0 280 55
of 0 280 55
people 0 280 55
should 0 280 55
ask 0 280 55
their 0 280 55
enemies 0 280 55
for 0 280 55
instructions 0 280 55
as 0 280 55
to 0 280 55
how 0 280 55
change 0 280 55
is 0 280 55
brought 0 280 55
about, 0 280 55
and 0 280 55
in 1 280 55
a 1 280 55
righteous 1 280 55
sense 1 280 55
reverse 1 280 55
the 1 280 55
lawlessness-taking 1 280 55
place 0 280 55
in 0 280 55
this 0 280 55
country 0 280 55
(Matthew 0 280 55
24:12). 0 280 55

These 1 280 56
groups 1 280 56
of 1 280 56
people 1 280 56
are 1 280 56
simply 1 280 56
enemies 1 280 56
of 1 280 56
the 1 280 56
cross 1 280 56
of 1 280 56
Christ 1 280 56
and 1 280 56
know 1 280 56
not 1 280 56
the 1 280 56
power 1 280 56
of 1 280 56
God 1 280 56
unto 1 280 56
salvation 1 280 56
(Philippians 0 280 56
3:18). 0 280 56

Furthermore, 0 280 57
I 0 280 57
said 0 280 57
to 0 280 57
this 0 280 57
woman 0 280 57
that 0 280 57
this 0 280 57
is 0 280 57
how 0 280 57
you 0 280 57
can 0 280 57
tell 0 280 57
who 0 280 57
the 1 280 57
genuine 1 280 57
Christians 1 280 57
are 0 280 57
that 0 280 57
are 0 280 57
in 0 280 57
the 0 280 57
fight 0 280 57
and 0 280 57
those 1 280 57
who 1 280 57
are 1 280 57
counterfeits. 1 280 57

When 0 280 58
the 0 280 58
church 0 280 58
and 0 280 58
the 0 280 58
world 0 280 58
can 0 280 58
jog 1 280 58
comfortably 1 280 58
along 1 280 58
together, 1 280 58
you 0 280 58
can 0 280 58
be 0 280 58
sure 0 280 58
something 0 280 58
is 0 280 58
wrong. 0 280 58

The 0 280 59
world 0 280 59
has 0 280 59
not 0 280 59
compromised—its 0 280 59
spirit 0 280 59
is 0 280 59
exactly 0 280 59
the 0 280 59
same 0 280 59
as 0 280 59
it 0 280 59
ever 0 280 59
was. 0 280 59

If 1 280 60
Christians 1 280 60
were 1 280 60
equally 1 280 60
as 1 280 60
faithful 1 280 60
to 1 280 60
the 1 280 60
Lord, 1 280 60
separated 1 280 60
from 1 280 60
the 1 280 60
world 1 280 60
(2 1 280 60
Corinthians 1 280 60
6:17), 1 280 60
and 1 280 60
living 1 280 60
so 1 280 60
that 1 280 60
their 1 280 60
lives 1 280 60
were 1 280 60
a 1 280 60
reproof 1 280 60
to 1 280 60
all 1 280 60
ungodliness, 1 280 60
the 1 280 60
world 1 280 60
would 1 280 60
hate 1 280 60
them 1 280 60
as 1 280 60
much 1 280 60
as 1 280 60
it 1 280 60
ever 1 280 60
did. 1 280 60

(John 0 280 61

It 0 280 61
is 0 280 61
the 0 280 61
church 0 280 61
that 0 280 61
has 0 280 61
compromised, 0 280 61
