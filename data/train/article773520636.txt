Recently, 0
I 0

a 0

a 1

friend 1
asking 0
me 0
what 0
my 0

was 0
on 0
an 0
article 0
titled, 0
“Scripture 0
teaches 0

submit 0
to 0
authorities” 0
with 0
reference 0
to 0
Romans 0
Chapter 0
13. 0

In 0
this 0

the 0
author 0
was 0
calling 0
out 0
a 0
Christian 0
for 0
protesting 0
a 0
corrupt 0
representative 0
in 0
government, 0
even 0
going 0
so 0
far 0
as 0
to 0
suggest 0
this 1
protestant 1
ought 1
to 1
have 1
stayed 1
home 1
to 1
read 1
their 1
Bible 1
rather 1
than 1
to 1
protest 1
corruption 1
in 1
government. 1

He 0
went 0

say 0

are 0

taken 1
the 1

that 0

up 0

that 0

The 0

this 1

should 1
know 1
what 1
the 1
Bible 1
says 1
about 1
those 1
in 1
authority. 1

First 0
of 0
all, 0
the 0
authority 0
given 0
to 0
our 0
representative 0
government 0
is 0
derived 0
from 0
“We 0
the 0
People.” 0

We 0
receive 0
our 0
rights 0
from 0
God, 0
and 0
in 0
turn, 0
delegate 0
power 0
to 0
those 0
who 0
serve 0
“We 0
the 0
People.” 0

Representatives 1
work 1
for 1
us, 1
we 1
do 1
not 1
work 1
for 1
them. 1

“They 0
are 0
endowed 0
by 0
their 0
Creator 0
with 0
certain 0
unalienable 0
Rights… 0
Governments 0
are 0
instituted 0
among 0
Men, 0
deriving 0
their 0
powers 0
from 0
the 0
consent 0
of 0
the 0
governed.” 0
-The 0
Declaration 0
of 0

He 0
then 0
quotes 0
Romans 0
13: 0
1-7 0

Let 0
every 0
soul 0
be 0
subject 0
unto 0
the 0
higher 0
powers. 0

For 0
there 0
is 0
no 0
power 0
but 0
of 0
God: 0
the 0
powers 0
that 0
be 0
are 0
ordained 0
of 0
God. 0

Whosoever 1
therefore 1
resisteth 1
the 1
power, 1
resisteth 1
the 1
ordinance 1
of 1
God: 1
and 1
they 1
that 1
resist 1
shall 1
receive 1
to 1
themselves 1
damnation. 1

For 0
rulers 0
are 0
not 0
a 0
terror 0
to 0
good 0
works, 0
but 0
to 0
the 0
evil. 0

Wilt 0
thou 0
then 0
not 0
be 0
afraid 0
of 0
the 0
power? 0

do 0
that 0
which 0
is 0
good, 0
and 0
thou 0
shalt 0
have 0
praise 0
of 0
the 0
same: 0

For 0
he 0
is 0
the 0
minister 0
of 0
God 0
to 0
thee 0
for 0
good. 0

But 0
if 0
thou 0
do 0
that 0
which 0
is 0
evil, 0
be 0
afraid; 0
for 0
he 0
beareth 0
not 0
the 0
sword 0
in 0
vain: 0
for 0
he 0
is 0
the 1
minister 1
of 1
God, 1
a 1
revenger 1
to 1
execute 1
wrath 1
upon 1
him 1
that 1
doeth 1
evil. 1

Wherefore 0
ye 0
must 0
needs 0
be 0
subject, 0
not 0
only 0
for 0
wrath, 0
but 0
also 0
for 0
conscience 0
sake. 0

For 0
for 0
this 0
cause 0
pay 0
ye 0
tribute 0
also: 0
for 0
they 0
are 0
God's 0
ministers, 0
attending 0
continually 0
upon 0
this 0
very 0
thing. 0

Render 0
therefore 0
to 0
all 0
their 0
dues: 0
tribute 0
to 0
whom 0
tribute 0
is 0
due; 0
custom 0
to 0
whom 0
custom; 0
fear 0
to 0
whom 0
fear; 0
honour 0
to 0
whom 0
honour. 0

The 0
first 0
Scripture 0
says: 0

Let 0
every 0
soul 0
be 0
subject 0
unto 0
the 0
higher 0
powers. 0

For 0
there 0
is 0
no 0
power 0
but 0
of 0
God: 0
the 0
powers 0
that 0
be 0
are 0
ordained 0
of 0
God. 0

God 0
ordained 0
the 0
power, 0
and 0
that 0
“rulers 0
are 0
not 0
a 0
terror 0
to 0
good 0
works, 0
but 0
to 0
the 0
evil." 0

Did 0
God 0
tell 0
His 0
Church 0
to 0
submit 0
to 0
that 0
which 0
He 0
condemns? 0

(Deuteronomy 0
25:1; 0
Proverbs 0
17:15) 0
Absolutely 1
not! 1

Is 0
the 0
Church 0
to 0
transgress 0
His 0
Laws, 0
or 0
to 0
magnify 0
and 0
enforce 0
His 0
Laws 0
unto 0
judgment? 0

(Psalm 0
40:8; 0
Romans 0
3:31) 0
Of 1
course 1
not! 1

If 0
He 0
did, 0
that 0
would 0
make 0
God 0
unjust. 0

Jesus 0
said, 0
"Think 0
not 0
that 0
I 0
am 0
come 0
to 0
destroy 0
the 0
law, 0
or 0
the 0
prophets: 0
I 0
am 0
not 0
come 0
to 0
destroy, 0
but 0
to 0
fulfil” 0
(Matthew 0
5:17). 0

The 0
Lord 0
has, 0
in 0
fact, 0
commanded 0
nowhere 0
in 0
Scripture 0
for 0
the 0
Church 0
to 0
submit 0
to 0
the 0
wicked. 0

The 0
Bible 0
teaches 0
just 0
the 0
exact 0
opposite. 0

We 0
are 0
to 0
“have 0
no 0
fellowship 0
with 0
the 0
unfruitful 1
works 1
of 1
darkness, 1
but 0
rather 0
reprove 0
(expose) 0
them” 0
(Ephesians 0
5:11). 0

Furthermore, 0
it 0
would 0
contradict 0
what 0
Scripture 0
teaches 0
us 0
from 0
Genesis 0
all 0
the 0
way 0
to 0
Revelation 0
every 0
step 0
of 0
the 0
way. 0

Think 0
of 0
this: 0
Those 0
that 0
serve 0
“We 1
the 1
People,” 1
before 0
taking 0
office, 0
swear 0
to 0
uphold 0
the 0
US 0
Constitution 0
with 0
their 0
hand 0
on 0
the 0
Holy 0
Bible. 0

They 0
are 0
appointed 0
to 0
magnify 0
law 0
against 0
crime, 0
not 0
crime 0
against 0
the 0
law 0
(Psalm 0
94:20). 0

America 0
is 0
based 0
on 0
Common 0
Law, 0
the 0
Mosaic 0
Institution. 0

Read 0
the 0
5 0
books 0
of 0
Moses. 0

“No 1
enactment 1
of 1
man 1
can 1
be 1
considered 1
law 1
unless 1
it 1
conforms 1
to 1
the 1
Law 1
of 1
God.” 1
–William 0
Blackstone, 0
English 0
Common 0
Law 0

Representatives 0
are 0
to 0
magnify 0
the 0
law, 0
not 0
tear 0
it 0
down; 0
and 0
yet, 0
this 0
is 0
what 0
the 1
biblically 1
illiterate 1
are 0
teaching 0
others 0
to 0
do, 0
submit 0
to 0
the 1
tyrants 1
and 0
resist 0
God, 0
His 0
Church 0
and 0
His 0
Word 0
(Micah 0
3:5). 0

I 1
ask, 1
are 1
Christians 1
to 1
submit 1
to 1
those 1
who 1
have 1
sanctioned 1
the 1
murder 1
of 1
the 1
innocent 1
in 1
the 1
womb 1
(Exodus 0
20:13; 0
Proverbs 0
6:17)? 0

Absolutely 1
not! 1

Are 1
Christians 1
to 1
submit 1
to 1
those 1
who 1
have 1
redefined 1
marriage 1
where 1
a 1
man 1
can 1
now 1
"marry" 1
a 1
man 1
and 1
a 1
woman 1
can 1
now 1
"marry" 1
a 1
woman 1
(Leviticus 0
18:22; 0
Romans 0
1:24 0
etc…)? 0

Absolutely 1
not! 1

Submit 1
to 1
those 1
who 1
lie 1
continuously, 1
to 1
them 1
that 1
steal 1
and 1
even 1
kill? 1

Absolutely 1
not! 1

Submit 0
to 0
what 0
God 0
condemns? 0

Yet, 0
this 0
is 0
what 0
the 1
perverse, 1
modern-day, 1
professing 1
Christians 1
are 0
teaching 0
the 1
sheep 1
in 0
the 0
American 0
Church 0
today. 0

It 0
would 0
do 0
you 0
well 0
to 0
now 0
look 0
to 0
the 0
Christ 0
when 0
He 0
said 0
that 0
we 0
are 0
to 0
beware 0
of 0
the 0
leaven 0
of 0
the 0
Pharisee’s 0
(corrupt 0
doctrines 0
of 0
those 0
who 0
claimed 0
to 0
be 0
the 1
children 1
of 1
God), 1
as 0
well 0
as 0
the 0
leaven 0
of 0
Herod 0
(corrupt 0
doctrines 0
of 0
government) 0
(Mark 0
8:15). 0

If 0
you 0
remember, 0
it 0
was 0
those 0
same 0
people 0
who 0
called 0
for 0
the 0
crucifixion 0
of 0
Christ 0
while 0
crying 1
out 1
“We 0
have 0
no 0
King 0
but 0
Caesar” 0
(John 0
19:15). 0

Do 0
these 0
that 0
teach 1
such 1
heresy 1
not 0
realize 0
that 0
every 0
apostle, 0
except 0
John, 0
was 0
killed 0
by 0
hostile 1
corrupt 1
civil 1
authorities 1
opposed 0
to 0
their 0
endeavors? 0

Christians 0
throughout 0
history 0
were 0
imprisoned, 0
tortured, 0
or 0
killed 0
by 0
corrupt 1
civil 1
authorities 1
of 1
all 1
stripes 1
for 0
refusing 0
to 0
submit 0
to 0
their 0
various, 0
lawless 0
policies 0
and 0
prohibitions. 0

Did 0
Christian 0
martyrs 0
violate 0
God’s 0
principles 0
of 0
submission 0
to 0
authority? 0

Of 1
course, 1
not. 1

Also, 0
keep 0
in 0
mind 0
that 0
magistrates 0
have 0
limited 0
and 0
defined 0
authority 0
in 0
civil 0
matters. 0

Take 0
note 0
that 0
civil 0
government 0
is 0
to 0
be, 0
and 0
must 0
be, 0
a 1
“terror 1
to 1
good 1
works.” 1
It 0
has 0
no 0
power 0
or 0
authority 0
to 0
terrorize 0
good 0
works 0
or 0
good, 1
law-abiding 1
people. 1

God 0
never 0
gave 0
them 0
that 0
authority 0
and 0
any, 0
and 0
all, 0
government 0
that 0
oversteps 0
the 0
divine 0
authority 0
and 0
its 0
boundaries 0
has 0
no 0
divine 0
authority 0
or 0
protection. 0

Civil 0
government 0
is 0
a 0
“minister 0
for 0
God 0
to 0
thee 0
for 0
good” 0
(Romans 0
13:4). 0

It 0
is 0
not 0
a 0
minister 0
of 0
God 0
for 0
evil. 0

Civil 0
magistrates 0
have 0
a 0
divine 0
duty 0
to 0
“execute 1
wrath 1
upon 1
him 1
that 1
doeth 1
evil.” 1
Anyone 1
who 1
teaches 1
that 1
they 1
have 1
authority 1
to 1
execute 1
wrath 1
upon 1
"him 1
that 1
doeth 1
good” 1
is 1
ignorant 1
and 1
uneducated 1
in 1
their 1
misleadings 1
(1 0
John 0
4:6). 0

To 0
tell 0
Christians 0
to 0
submit 0
to 0
evil 1
civil 1
authority 1
is 0
teaching 0
the 0
opposite 0
of 0
what 0
is 0
true. 0

Common 0
sense 0
does 0
come 0
into 0
play 0
here. 0

I 0
ask, 0
did 0
Moses 0
violate 0
God's 0
principle 0
of 0
submission 0
when 0
he 0
was 0
commanded 0
by 0
God, 0
“Go 0
in 0
unto 0
Pharaoh, 0
and 0
tell 0
him, 0
Thus 0
saith 0
the 1
LORD 1
God 1
of 1
the 1
Hebrews, 1
Let 0
my 0
people 0
go, 0
that 0
they 0
may 0
serve 0
me” 0
(Exodus 0
9:1). 0

And 0
when 0
Pharaoh 0
refused, 0
God 0
plagued 0
the 0
Pharaoh 0
and 0
the 0
Egyptians 0

set 0
His 0
children 0
free. 0

Think 0
of 0
this, 0
the 1
meekest 1
man 1
alive 1
was 0
sent 0
to 0
the 0
face 0
of 0
the 0
Pharaoh 0
to 1
tell 1
him 1
to 1
obey 1
or 1
else. 1

Is 0
this 0
what 0
is 0
being 0
preached 0
from 0
the 0
pulpits 0
across 0
America 0
today? 0

Or 0
what 0
of 0
Gideon 0
who 0
was 0
to 0
deliver 0
the 0
Children 0
of 0
Israel 0
from 0
the 0
Midianites? 0

The 0
first 0
thing 0
the 0
Lord 0
commanded 0
him 0
to 0
do 0
was 0
to 0
tear 0
down 0
his 0
father's 0
altars 0
(Judges 0
6:25). 0

Was 0
this 0
a 0
violation 0
of 0
God's 0
principles 0
of 0
submission? 0

The 0
sins 0
of 0
the 0
fathers 0
were 0
the 0
reason 0
the 0
Midianites 0
had 0
power 0
to 0
oppress 0
them. 0

What 0
of 0
that 0
lone 0
prophet, 0
Elijah? 0

The 1
tyrant 1
Ahab 0
called 0
him 0
the 1
troubler 1
of 1
Israel. 1

Elijah 0
set 0
the 0
record 0
straight 0
when 0
he 0
answered, 0
"I 0
have 0
not 0
troubled 0
Israel; 0
but 0
thou, 0
and 0
thy 0
father's 0
house, 0
in 0
that 0
ye 0
have 0
forsaken 0
the 0
commandments 0
of 0
the 1
LORD, 1
and 0
thou 0
hast 0
followed 0
Baalim 0
(1 0
Kings 0
18:18). 0

Is 0
this 0
a 0
violation 1
of 1
God's 1
principles 1
when 0
it 0
came 0
to 0
submission 0
to 0
authority? 0

Elijah 0
took 0
Ahab 0
and 0
the 0
false 0
prophets 0
to 0
the 0
top 0
of 0
Mount 0
Carmel 0
where 0
the 0
God 0
of 0
Israel 0
consumed 0
the 0
sacrifice 0
by 0
fire, 0
and 0
the 0
false 0
prophets 0
were 0
killed 0
(1 0
Kings 0
18:38-40). 0

What 0
of 0
King 0
David? 0

Was 0
he 0
violating 0
God’s 0
principles 0
of 0
submission 0
when 0
he 0
refused 0
to 0
surrender 0
himself 0
to 0
Saul’s 0
troops? 0

David 0
was 0
a 0
king 0
that 0
was 0
to 0
overthrow 0
corrupt 0
governments 0
by 0
dispossessing 0
them 0
and 0
establishing 0
righteousness 0
through 0
justice 0
and 0
judgment 0
(Jeremiah 0
23:5; 0
Isaiah 0
51:4). 0

Did 0
Shadrach, 0
Meshach 0
and 0
Abednego 0
violate 0
God's 0
principle 0
of 0
submission 0
when 0
they 0
refused 0
to 0
worship 0
King 0
Nebuchadnezzar’s 0
image? 0

Then 0
the 0
princes, 0
the 0
governors, 0
and 0
captains, 0
the 0
judges, 0
the 0
treasurers, 0
the 0
counsellors, 0
the 0
sheriffs, 0
and 0
all 0
the 0
rulers 0
of 0
the 0
provinces, 0
were 0
gathered 0
together 0
unto 0
the 0
dedication 0
of 0
the 0
image 0
that 0
Nebuchadnezzar 0
the 0
king 0
had 0
set 0
up; 0
and 0
they 0
stood 0
before 0
the 0
image 0
that 0
Nebuchadnezzar 0
had 0
set 0
up. 0

Then 0
an 0
herald 0
cried 1
aloud, 1
To 0
you 0
it 0
is 0
commanded, 0
O 0
people, 0
nations, 0
and 0
languages, 0

That 0
at 0
what 0
time 0
ye 0
hear 0
the 0
sound 0
of 0
the 0
cornet, 0
flute, 0
harp, 0
sackbut, 0
psaltery, 0
dulcimer, 0
and 0
all 0
kinds 0
of 0
musick, 0
ye 0
fall 0
down 0
and 0
worship 0
the 0
golden 0
image 0
that 0
Nebuchadnezzar 0
the 0
king 0
hath 0
set 0
up: 0

And 0
whoso 1
falleth 1
not 1
down 1
and 1
worshippeth 1
shall 1
the 1
same 1
hour 1
be 1
cast 1
into 1
the 1
midst 1
of 1
a 1
burning 1
fiery 1
furnace. 1

Daniel 0
3:3-6 0

When 0
they 0
refused 0
to 0
submit 0
to 0
the 1
tyrant, 1
the 0
furnace 0
was 0
heated 0
up 0
7 0
times 0
hotter 0
so 0
that 0
the 0
guards 0
were 0
consumed, 0
only 0
to 0
have 0
the 0
fourth 0
man, 0
“like 0
the 0
Son 0
of 0
man,” 0
show 0
up 0
to 0
deliver 0
them 0
where 0
the 0
fire 0
had 0
no 0
power 0
over 0
them, 0
and 0
not 0
a 0
hair 0
of 0
their 0
heads 0
was 0
singed. 0

In 0
the 0
end, 0
Only 0
the 1
corrupt 1
king 1
acknowledges 0
the 0
God 0
of 0
Shadrach, 0
Meshach, 0
and 0
Abednego. 0

“Blessed 0
be 0
the 0
God 0
of 0
Shadrach, 0
Meshach, 0
and 0
Abednego, 0
who 0
hath 0
sent 0
his 0
angel, 0
and 0
delivered 0
his 0
servants 0
that 0
trusted 0
in 0
him, 0
and 0
have 0
changed 0
the 0
king's 0
word, 0
and 0
yielded 0
their 0
bodies, 0
that 0
they 0
might 0
not 0
serve 0
nor 0
worship 0
any 0
god, 0
except 0
their 0
own 0
God.” 0
Daniel 0
3:28 0

Did 0
Daniel 0
violate 0
God's 0
principles 0
of 0
submission 0
when 0
he 0
disobeyed 0
the 0
king's 0
order 0
to 0
stop 0
praying 0
to 0
any 0
god 0
but 0
himself? 0

Keep 0
in 0
mind 0
that 0
the 0
punishment 0
was 0
that 0
Daniel 0
was 0
thrown 0
into 0
a 0
den 0
of 0
lions 0
in 0
which 0
God 0
sent 0
forth 0
an 0
angel 0
to 0
protect 0
him. 0

His 0
accusers 0
were 0
then 0
thrown 0
into 0
the 0
den 0
and 0
devoured 0
by 0
the 0
very 0
lions 0
that 0
they 0
meant 0
to 0
have 0
devoured 0
Daniel 0
(Daniel 0
6). 0

What 0
of 0
Jeremiah? 0

Was 0
he 0
violating 0
God's 0
principles 0
of 0
submission 0
when 0
he 0
was 0
sent 0
to 0
preach 0
repentance 0
to 0
the 0
corrupt 0
church 0
and 0
the 0
corrupt 0
kings? 0

For, 0
behold, 0
I 0
have 0
made 0
thee 0
this 0
day 0
a 0
defenced 0
city, 0
and 0
an 0
iron 0
pillar, 0
and 0
brasen 0
walls 0
against 0
the 0
whole 0
land, 0
against 0
the 0
kings 0
of 0
Judah, 0
against 0
the 0
princes 0
thereof, 0
against 0
the 0
priests 0
thereof, 0
and 0
against 0
the 0
people 0
of 0
the 0
land. 0

Jeremiah 0
1:18 0

Don’t 0
forget 0
about 0
Amos, 0
who 0
was 0
prophesying 0
judgment 0
upon 0
the 1
corrupt 1
priests 1
and 1
the 1
corrupt 1
king 1
of 0
his 0
day 0
(Amos 0
7:10-16). 0

Was 0
that 0
violating, 0
or 0
fulfilling 0
God's 0
principles 0
and 0
purposes? 0

What 0
of 0
the 0
New 0
Testament? 0

John 0
the 0
Baptist 0
points 0
out 0
all 1
of 1
the 1
evils 1
of 0
King 0
Herod 0
(Luke 0
3:19). 0

Was 0
this 0
a 0
violation 0
of 0
submission 0
to 0
civil 0
government? 0

No, 0
it 0
was 0
a 0
rebuke 0
to 0
corruption 0
in 0
government 0
to 0
submit 0
to 0
the 0
God 0
of 0
Abraham, 0
Isaac 0
and 0
Jacob 0
and 0
His 0
laws. 0

Is 0
it 0
a 0
violation 0
of 0
submission 0
to 0
God's 0
principles 0
to 0
keep 0
preaching, 0
“Repent, 0
and 0
be 0
baptized 0
every 0
one 0
of 0
you 0
in 0
the 0
name 0
of 0
Jesus 0
Christ 0
for 0
the 0
remission 0
of 0
sins…”? 0

Absolutely 1
not! 1

The 1
corrupt 1
Pharisees 1
along 0
with 0
corrupt 1
government 1
did 0
the 0
opposite. 0

“Being 0
grieved 0
that 0
they 0
taught 0
the 0
people, 0
and 0
preached 0
through 0
Jesus 0
the 0
resurrection 0
from 0
the 0
dead. 0

And 0
they 0
laid 0
hands 0
on 0
them, 0
and 0
put 0
them 0
in 0
hold 0
unto 0
the 0
next 0
day: 0
for 0
it 0
was 0
now 0
eventide. 0

Howbeit 0
many 0
of 0
them 0
which 0
heard 0
the 0
word 0
believed; 0
and 0
the 0
number 0
of 0
the 0
men 0
was 0
about 0
five 0
thousand. 0

And 0
it 0
came 0
to 0
pass 0
on 0
the 0
morrow, 0
that 0
their 0
rulers, 0
and 0
elders, 0
and 0
scribes, 0
and 0
Annas 0
the 0
high 0
priest, 0
and 0
Caiaphas, 0
and 0
John, 0
and 0
Alexander, 0
and 0
as 0
many 0
as 0
were 0
of 0
the 0
kindred 0
of 0
the 0
high 0
priest, 0
were 0
gathered 0
together 0
at 0
Jerusalem. 0

And 0
when 0
they 0
had 0
set 0
them 0
in 0
the 0
midst, 0
they 0
asked, 0
By 0
what 0
power, 0
or 0
by 0
what 0
name, 0
have 0
ye 0
done 0
this? 0

Then 0
Peter, 0
filled 0
with 0
the 0
Holy 0
Ghost, 0
said 0
unto 0
them, 0
Ye 0
rulers 0
of 0
the 0
people, 0
and 0
elders 0
of 0
Israel, 0

If 0
we 0
this 0
day 0
be 0
examined 0
of 0
the 0
good 0
deed 0
done 0
to 0
the 1
impotent 1
man, 1
by 0
what 0
means 0
he 0
is 0
made 0
whole; 0

Be 0
it 0
known 0
unto 0
you 0
all, 0
and 0
to 0
all 0
the 0
people 0
of 0
Israel, 0
that 0
by 0
the 0
name 0
of 0
Jesus 0
Christ 0
of 0
Nazareth, 0
whom 0
ye 0
crucified, 0
whom 0
God 0
raised 0
from 0
the 0
dead, 0
even 0
by 0
him 0
doth 0
this 0
man 0
stand 0
here 0
before 0
you 0
whole. 0

This 0
is 0
the 0
stone 0
which 0
was 0
set 0
at 0
nought 0
of 0
you 0
builders, 0
which 0
is 0
become 0
the 0
head 0
of 0
the 0
corner. 0

Neither 0
is 0
there 0
salvation 0
in 0
any 0
other: 0
for 0
there 0
is 0
none 0
other 0
name 0
under 0
heaven 0
given 0
among 0
men, 0
whereby 0
we 0
must 0
be 0
saved. 0

Now 0
when 0
they 0
saw 0
the 0
boldness 0
of 0
Peter 0
and 0
John, 0
and 0
perceived 0
that 0
they 0
were 0
unlearned 1
and 1
ignorant 1
men, 1
they 0
marvelled; 0
and 0
they 0
took 0
knowledge 0
of 0
them, 0
that 0
they 0
had 0
been 0
with 0
Jesus. 0

And 0
beholding 0
the 0
man 0
which 0
was 0
healed 0
standing 0
with 0
them, 0
they 0
could 0
say 0
nothing 0
against 0
it. 0

But 0
when 0
they 0
had 0
commanded 0
them 0
to 0
go 0
aside 0
out 0
of 0
the 0
council, 0
they 0
conferred 0
among 0
themselves, 0

Saying, 0
What 0
shall 0
we 0
do 0
to 0
these 0
men? 0

for 0
that 0
indeed 0
a 0
notable 0
miracle 0
hath 0
been 0
done 0
by 0
them 0
is 0
manifest 0
to 0
all 0
them 0
that 0
dwell 0
in 0
Jerusalem; 0
and 0
we 0
cannot 0
deny 0
it. 0

But 0
that 0
it 0
spread 0
no 0
further 0
among 0
the 0
people, 0
let 0
us 0
straitly 0
threaten 0
them, 0
that 0
they 0
speak 0
henceforth 0
to 0
no 0
man 0
in 0
this 0
name. 0

And 0
they 0
called 0
them, 0
and 0
commanded 0
them 0
not 0
to 0
speak 0
at 0
all 0
nor 0
teach 0
in 0
the 0
name 0
of 0
Jesus. 0

But 0
Peter 0
and 0
John 0
answered 0
and 0
said 0
unto 0
them, 0
Whether 0
it 0
be 0
right 0
in 0
the 0
sight 0
of 0
God 0
to 0
hearken 0
unto 0
you 0
more 0
than 0
unto 0
God, 0
judge 0
ye. 0

For 0
we 0
cannot 0
but 0
speak 0
the 0
things 0
which 0
we 0
have 0
seen 0
and 0
heard.” 0
Acts 0
4:2-20 0

Or 0
what 0
of 0
the 0
account 0
found 0
in 0
Acts 0
12:1-11, 0
where 0
the 0
Lord 0
sent 0
an 0
Angel 0
to 0
liberate 0
Peter 0
from 0
the 0
hands 0
of 0
tyrants. 1

“Now 0
about 0
that 0
time 0
Herod 0
the 0
king 0
stretched 0
forth 0
his 0
hands 0
to 0
vex 0
certain 0
of 0
the 0
church. 0

And 0
he 0
killed 0
James 0
the 0
brother 0
of 0
John 0
with 0
the 0
sword. 0

And 0
because 0
he 0
saw 0
it 0
pleased 0
the 0
Jews, 0
he 0
proceeded 0
further 0
to 0
take 0
Peter 0
also. 0

(Then 0
were 0
the 0
days 0
of 0
unleavened 0
bread.) 0

And 0
when 0
he 0
had 0
apprehended 0
him, 0
he 0
put 0
him 0
in 0
prison, 0
and 0
delivered 0
him 0
to 0
four 0
quaternions 0
of 0
soldiers 0
to 0
keep 0
him; 0
intending 0
after 0
Easter 0
to 0
bring 0
him 0
forth 0
to 0
the 0
people. 0

Peter 0
therefore 0
was 0
kept 0
in 0
prison: 0
but 0
prayer 0
was 0
made 0
without 0
ceasing 0
of 0
the 0
church 0
unto 0
God 0
for 0
him. 0

And 0
when 0
Herod 0
would 0
have 0
brought 0
him 0
forth, 0
the 0
same 0
night 0
Peter 0
was 0
sleeping 0
between 0
two 0
soldiers, 0
bound 0
with 0
two 0
chains: 0
and 0
the 0
keepers 0
before 0
the 0
door 0
kept 0
the 0
prison. 0

And, 0
behold, 0
the 0
angel 0
of 0
the 0
Lord 0
came 0
upon 0
him, 0
and 0
a 0
light 0
shined 0
in 0
the 0
prison: 0
and 0
he 0
smote 0
Peter 0
on 0
the 0
side, 0
and 0
raised 0
him 0
up, 0
saying, 0
Arise 0
up 0
quickly. 0

And 0
his 0
chains 0
fell 0
off 0
from 0
his 0
hands. 0

And 0
the 0
angel 0
said 0
unto 0
him, 0
Gird 0
thyself, 0
and 0
bind 0
on 0
thy 0
sandals. 0

And 0
so 0
he 0
did. 0

And 0
he 0
saith 0
unto 0
him, 0
Cast 0
thy 0
garment 0
about 0
thee, 0
and 0
follow 0
me. 0

And 0
he 0
went 0
out, 0
and 0
followed 0
him; 0
and 0
wist 0
not 0
that 0
it 0
was 0
true 0
which 0
was 0
done 0
by 0
the 0
angel; 0
but 0
thought 0
he 0
saw 0
a 0
vision. 0

When 0
they 0
were 0
past 0
the 0
first 0
and 0
the 0
second 0
ward, 0
they 0
came 0
unto 0
the 0
iron 0
gate 0
that 0
leadeth 0
unto 0
the 0
city; 0
which 0
opened 0
to 0
them 0
of 0
his 0
own 0
accord: 0
and 0
they 0
went 0
out, 0
and 0
passed 0
on 0
through 0
one 0
street; 0
and 0
forthwith 0
the 0
angel 0
departed 0
from 0
him. 0

And 0
when 0
Peter 0
was 0
come 0
to 0
himself, 0
he 0
said, 0
Now 0
I 0
know 0
of 0
a 0
surety, 0
that 0
the 0
Lord 0
hath 0
sent 0
his 0
angel, 0
and 0
hath 0
delivered 0
me 0
out 0
of 0
the 0
hand 0
of 0
Herod, 0
and 0
from 0
all 0
the 0
expectation 0
of 0
the 0
people 0
of 0
the 0
Jews.” 0

Over 0
and 0
over 0
again, 0
you 0
can 0
see 0
that 0
the 0
Church 0
was 0
to 0
stand 0
in 0
protest 0
against 0
the 1
wicked 1
that 1
were 1
at 1
war 1
with 1
Christ 1
(Revelation 0
