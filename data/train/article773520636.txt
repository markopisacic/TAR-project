from 0 77 5
a 1 77 5

biblically 1 77 5

friend 1 77 5
asking 0 77 5
me 0 77 5
what 0 77 5
my 0 77 5
take 0 77 5
was 0 77 5
on 0 77 5
an 0 77 5

titled, 0 77 5
“Scripture 0 77 5

with 0 77 5
reference 0 77 5
to 0 77 5

Chapter 0 77 5
13. 0 77 5

In 0 77 6
this 0 77 6
article, 0 77 6
the 0 77 6
author 0 77 6
was 0 77 6
calling 0 77 6
out 0 77 6
a 0 77 6

for 0 77 6
protesting 0 77 6
a 0 77 6
corrupt 0 77 6

even 0 77 6
going 0 77 6
so 0 77 6
far 0 77 6
as 0 77 6
to 0 77 6
suggest 0 77 6
this 1 77 6
protestant 1 77 6
ought 1 77 6
to 1 77 6
have 1 77 6
stayed 1 77 6
home 1 77 6
to 1 77 6
read 1 77 6
their 1 77 6

rather 1 77 6

He 0 77 7

unto 0 77 36

there 0 77 37
is 0 77 37
no 0 77 37
power 0 77 37

of 0 77 37

the 0 77 37
powers 0 77 37
that 0 77 37

of 0 77 37
God. 0 77 37

Whosoever 1 77 38
therefore 1 77 38
resisteth 1 77 38
the 1 77 38
power, 1 77 38
resisteth 1 77 38
the 1 77 38

God: 1 77 38
and 1 77 38
they 1 77 38
that 1 77 38
resist 1 77 38
shall 1 77 38
receive 1 77 38
to 1 77 38
themselves 1 77 38
damnation. 1 77 38

which 0 77 41
is 0 77 41

God, 1 77 43
a 1 77 43
revenger 1 77 43
to 1 77 43
execute 1 77 43
wrath 1 77 43
upon 1 77 43
him 1 77 43
that 1 77 43
doeth 1 77 43
evil. 1 77 43

Wherefore 0 77 44
ye 0 77 44
must 0 77 44
needs 0 77 44
be 0 77 44
subject, 0 77 44
not 0 77 44
only 0 77 44
for 0 77 44
wrath, 0 77 44
but 0 77 44
also 0 77 44
for 0 77 44
conscience 0 77 44
sake. 0 77 44

For 0 77 45
for 0 77 45
this 0 77 45
cause 0 77 45
pay 0 77 45
ye 0 77 45
tribute 0 77 45
also: 0 77 45
for 0 77 45
they 0 77 45
are 0 77 45
God's 0 77 45
ministers, 0 77 45
attending 0 77 45
continually 0 77 45
upon 0 77 45
this 0 77 45
very 0 77 45
thing. 0 77 45

Render 0 77 46
therefore 0 77 46
to 0 77 46
all 0 77 46
their 0 77 46
dues: 0 77 46
tribute 0 77 46
to 0 77 46
whom 0 77 46
tribute 0 77 46
is 0 77 46
due; 0 77 46
custom 0 77 46
to 0 77 46
whom 0 77 46
custom; 0 77 46
fear 0 77 46
to 0 77 46
whom 0 77 46
fear; 0 77 46
honour 0 77 46
to 0 77 46
whom 0 77 46
honour. 0 77 46

The 0 77 47
first 0 77 47
Scripture 0 77 47
says: 0 77 47

Let 0 77 48
every 0 77 48
soul 0 77 48
be 0 77 48
subject 0 77 48
unto 0 77 48
the 0 77 48
higher 0 77 48
powers. 0 77 48

For 0 77 49
there 0 77 49
is 0 77 49
no 0 77 49
power 0 77 49
but 0 77 49
of 0 77 49
God: 0 77 49
the 0 77 49
powers 0 77 49
that 0 77 49
be 0 77 49
are 0 77 49
ordained 0 77 49
of 0 77 49
God. 0 77 49

God 0 77 50
ordained 0 77 50
the 0 77 50
power, 0 77 50
and 0 77 50
that 0 77 50
“rulers 0 77 50
are 0 77 50
not 0 77 50
a 0 77 50
terror 0 77 50
to 0 77 50
good 0 77 50
works, 0 77 50
but 0 77 50
to 0 77 50
the 0 77 50
evil." 0 77 50

Did 0 77 51
God 0 77 51
tell 0 77 51
His 0 77 51
Church 0 77 51
to 0 77 51
submit 0 77 51
to 0 77 51
that 0 77 51
which 0 77 51
He 0 77 51
condemns? 0 77 51

(Deuteronomy 0 77 52
25:1; 0 77 52
Proverbs 0 77 52
17:15) 0 77 52
Absolutely 1 77 52
not! 1 77 52

Is 0 77 53
the 0 77 53
Church 0 77 53
to 0 77 53
transgress 0 77 53
His 0 77 53
Laws, 0 77 53
or 0 77 53
to 0 77 53
magnify 0 77 53
and 0 77 53
enforce 0 77 53
His 0 77 53
Laws 0 77 53
unto 0 77 53
judgment? 0 77 53

(Psalm 0 77 54
40:8; 0 77 54
Romans 0 77 54
3:31) 0 77 54
Of 1 77 54
course 1 77 54
not! 1 77 54

If 0 77 55
He 0 77 55
did, 0 77 55
that 0 77 55
would 0 77 55
make 0 77 55
God 0 77 55
unjust. 0 77 55

Jesus 0 77 56
said, 0 77 56
"Think 0 77 56
not 0 77 56
that 0 77 56
I 0 77 56
am 0 77 56
come 0 77 56
to 0 77 56
destroy 0 77 56
the 0 77 56
law, 0 77 56
or 0 77 56
the 0 77 56
prophets: 0 77 56
I 0 77 56
am 0 77 56
not 0 77 56
come 0 77 56
to 0 77 56
destroy, 0 77 56
but 0 77 56
to 0 77 56
fulfil” 0 77 56
(Matthew 0 77 56
5:17). 0 77 56

The 0 77 57
Lord 0 77 57
has, 0 77 57
in 0 77 57
fact, 0 77 57
commanded 0 77 57
nowhere 0 77 57
in 0 77 57
Scripture 0 77 57
for 0 77 57
the 0 77 57
Church 0 77 57
to 0 77 57
submit 0 77 57
to 0 77 57
the 0 77 57
wicked. 0 77 57

The 0 77 58
Bible 0 77 58
teaches 0 77 58
just 0 77 58
the 0 77 58
exact 0 77 58
opposite. 0 77 58

We 0 77 59
are 0 77 59
to 0 77 59
“have 0 77 59
no 0 77 59
fellowship 0 77 59
with 0 77 59
the 0 77 59
unfruitful 1 77 59
works 1 77 59
of 1 77 59
darkness, 1 77 59
but 0 77 59
rather 0 77 59
reprove 0 77 59
(expose) 0 77 59
them” 0 77 59
(Ephesians 0 77 59
5:11). 0 77 59

Furthermore, 0 77 60
it 0 77 60
would 0 77 60
contradict 0 77 60
what 0 77 60
Scripture 0 77 60
teaches 0 77 60
us 0 77 60
from 0 77 60
Genesis 0 77 60
all 0 77 60
the 0 77 60
way 0 77 60
to 0 77 60
Revelation 0 77 60
every 0 77 60
step 0 77 60
of 0 77 60
the 0 77 60
way. 0 77 60

Think 0 77 61
of 0 77 61
this: 0 77 61
Those 0 77 61
that 0 77 61
serve 0 77 61
“We 1 77 61
the 1 77 61
People,” 1 77 61
before 0 77 61
taking 0 77 61
office, 0 77 61
swear 0 77 61
to 0 77 61
uphold 0 77 61
the 0 77 61
US 0 77 61
Constitution 0 77 61
with 0 77 61
their 0 77 61
hand 0 77 61
on 0 77 61
the 0 77 61
Holy 0 77 61
Bible. 0 77 61

They 0 77 62
are 0 77 62
appointed 0 77 62
to 0 77 62
magnify 0 77 62
law 0 77 62
against 0 77 62
crime, 0 77 62
not 0 77 62
crime 0 77 62
against 0 77 62
the 0 77 62
law 0 77 62
(Psalm 0 77 62
94:20). 0 77 62

America 0 77 63
is 0 77 63

on 0 77 63
Common 0 77 63
Law, 0 77 63
the 0 77 63

Moses. 0 77 64

“No 1 77 65

to 1 77 65

not 0 77 66
tear 0 77 66
it 0 77 66
down; 0 77 66
and 0 77 66
yet, 0 77 66
this 0 77 66
is 0 77 66
what 0 77 66
the 1 77 66
biblically 1 77 66
illiterate 1 77 66
are 0 77 66
teaching 0 77 66
others 0 77 66

do, 0 77 66
submit 0 77 66
to 0 77 66
the 1 77 66

His 0 77 66
Church 0 77 66
and 0 77 66
His 0 77 66
Word 0 77 66
(Micah 0 77 66
3:5). 0 77 66

I 1 77 67
ask, 1 77 67
are 1 77 67
Christians 1 77 67
to 1 77 67
submit 1 77 67
to 1 77 67
those 1 77 67
who 1 77 67
have 1 77 67
sanctioned 1 77 67
the 1 77 67
murder 1 77 67
of 1 77 67
the 1 77 67
innocent 1 77 67
in 1 77 67
the 1 77 67
womb 1 77 67
(Exodus 0 77 67
20:13; 0 77 67
Proverbs 0 77 67
6:17)? 0 77 67

Absolutely 1 77 68
not! 1 77 68

Are 1 77 69
Christians 1 77 69
to 1 77 69
submit 1 77 69
to 1 77 69
those 1 77 69
who 1 77 69
have 1 77 69
redefined 1 77 69
marriage 1 77 69
where 1 77 69
a 1 77 69
man 1 77 69
can 1 77 69
now 1 77 69
"marry" 1 77 69
a 1 77 69
man 1 77 69
and 1 77 69
a 1 77 69
woman 1 77 69
can 1 77 69
now 1 77 69
"marry" 1 77 69
a 1 77 69
woman 1 77 69
(Leviticus 0 77 69
18:22; 0 77 69
Romans 0 77 69
1:24 0 77 69
etc…)? 0 77 69

Absolutely 1 77 70
not! 1 77 70

Submit 1 77 71
to 1 77 71
those 1 77 71
who 1 77 71
lie 1 77 71
continuously, 1 77 71
to 1 77 71
them 1 77 71
that 1 77 71
steal 1 77 71
and 1 77 71
even 1 77 71
kill? 1 77 71

Absolutely 1 77 72
not! 1 77 72

Submit 0 77 73
to 0 77 73
what 0 77 73
God 0 77 73
condemns? 0 77 73

Yet, 0 77 74
this 0 77 74
is 0 77 74
what 0 77 74
the 1 77 74
perverse, 1 77 74
modern-day, 1 77 74
professing 1 77 74
Christians 1 77 74
are 0 77 74
teaching 0 77 74
the 1 77 74
sheep 1 77 74
in 0 77 74
the 0 77 74
American 0 77 74
Church 0 77 74
today. 0 77 74

It 0 77 75
would 0 77 75
do 0 77 75
you 0 77 75
well 0 77 75
to 0 77 75
now 0 77 75
look 0 77 75
to 0 77 75
the 0 77 75
Christ 0 77 75
when 0 77 75
He 0 77 75
said 0 77 75
that 0 77 75
we 0 77 75
are 0 77 75
to 0 77 75
beware 0 77 75
of 0 77 75
the 0 77 75
leaven 0 77 75
of 0 77 75
the 0 77 75
Pharisee’s 0 77 75
(corrupt 0 77 75
doctrines 0 77 75
of 0 77 75
those 0 77 75
who 0 77 75
claimed 0 77 75
to 0 77 75
be 0 77 75
the 1 77 75
children 1 77 75
of 1 77 75
God), 1 77 75
as 0 77 75
well 0 77 75
as 0 77 75
the 0 77 75
leaven 0 77 75
of 0 77 75
Herod 0 77 75
(corrupt 0 77 75
doctrines 0 77 75
of 0 77 75
government) 0 77 75
(Mark 0 77 75
8:15). 0 77 75

If 0 77 76
you 0 77 76
remember, 0 77 76
it 0 77 76
was 0 77 76
those 0 77 76
same 0 77 76
people 0 77 76
who 0 77 76
called 0 77 76
for 0 77 76
the 0 77 76
crucifixion 0 77 76
of 0 77 76
Christ 0 77 76
while 0 77 76
crying 1 77 76
out 1 77 76
“We 0 77 76
have 0 77 76
no 0 77 76
King 0 77 76
but 0 77 76
Caesar” 0 77 76
(John 0 77 76
19:15). 0 77 76

Do 0 77 77
these 0 77 77
that 0 77 77
teach 1 77 77
such 1 77 77
heresy 1 77 77
not 0 77 77
realize 0 77 77
that 0 77 77
every 0 77 77
apostle, 0 77 77
except 0 77 77
John, 0 77 77
was 0 77 77
killed 0 77 77
by 0 77 77
hostile 1 77 77
corrupt 1 77 77
civil 1 77 77
authorities 1 77 77
opposed 0 77 77
to 0 77 77
their 0 77 77
endeavors? 0 77 77

Christians 0 77 78
throughout 0 77 78
history 0 77 78
were 0 77 78
imprisoned, 0 77 78
tortured, 0 77 78
or 0 77 78
killed 0 77 78
by 0 77 78
corrupt 1 77 78
civil 1 77 78
authorities 1 77 78
of 1 77 78
all 1 77 78
stripes 1 77 78
for 0 77 78
refusing 0 77 78
to 0 77 78
submit 0 77 78
to 0 77 78
their 0 77 78
various, 0 77 78
lawless 0 77 78
policies 0 77 78
and 0 77 78
prohibitions. 0 77 78

Did 0 77 79
Christian 0 77 79
martyrs 0 77 79
violate 0 77 79
God’s 0 77 79
principles 0 77 79
of 0 77 79
submission 0 77 79
to 0 77 79
authority? 0 77 79

Of 1 77 80
course, 1 77 80
not. 1 77 80

Also, 0 77 81
keep 0 77 81
in 0 77 81
mind 0 77 81
that 0 77 81
magistrates 0 77 81
have 0 77 81
limited 0 77 81
and 0 77 81
defined 0 77 81
authority 0 77 81
in 0 77 81
civil 0 77 81
matters. 0 77 81

Take 0 77 82
note 0 77 82
that 0 77 82
civil 0 77 82
government 0 77 82
is 0 77 82
to 0 77 82
be, 0 77 82
and 0 77 82
must 0 77 82
be, 0 77 82
a 1 77 82
“terror 1 77 82
to 1 77 82
good 1 77 82
works.” 1 77 82
It 0 77 82
has 0 77 82
no 0 77 82
power 0 77 82
or 0 77 82
authority 0 77 82
to 0 77 82
terrorize 0 77 82
good 0 77 82
works 0 77 82
or 0 77 82
good, 1 77 82
law-abiding 1 77 82
people. 1 77 82

God 0 77 83
never 0 77 83
gave 0 77 83
them 0 77 83
that 0 77 83
authority 0 77 83
and 0 77 83
any, 0 77 83
and 0 77 83
all, 0 77 83
government 0 77 83
that 0 77 83
oversteps 0 77 83
the 0 77 83
divine 0 77 83
authority 0 77 83
and 0 77 83
its 0 77 83
boundaries 0 77 83
has 0 77 83
no 0 77 83
divine 0 77 83
authority 0 77 83
or 0 77 83
protection. 0 77 83

Civil 0 77 84
government 0 77 84
is 0 77 84
a 0 77 84
“minister 0 77 84
for 0 77 84
God 0 77 84

for 0 77 84
good” 0 77 84
(Romans 0 77 84
13:4). 0 77 84

It 0 77 85
is 0 77 85
not 0 77 85
a 0 77 85
minister 0 77 85
of 0 77 85
God 0 77 85
for 0 77 85
evil. 0 77 85

Civil 0 77 86
magistrates 0 77 86
have 0 77 86
a 0 77 86
divine 0 77 86

to 0 77 86
“execute 1 77 86

Anyone 1 77 86
who 1 77 86
teaches 1 77 86
that 1 77 86

I 0 77 89
ask, 0 77 89
did 0 77 89
Moses 0 77 89
violate 0 77 89
God's 0 77 89
principle 0 77 89
of 0 77 89
submission 0 77 89
when 0 77 89
he 0 77 89
was 0 77 89
commanded 0 77 89
by 0 77 89
God, 0 77 89
“Go 0 77 89
in 0 77 89
unto 0 77 89
Pharaoh, 0 77 89

him, 0 77 89
Thus 0 77 89
saith 0 77 89

And 0 77 90
when 0 77 90
Pharaoh 0 77 90

fulfilling 0 77 122

No, 0 77 126
it 0 77 126
was 0 77 126

along 0 77 129
with 0 77 129

the 0 77 129
opposite. 0 77 129

“Being 0 77 130
grieved 0 77 130
that 0 77 130
they 0 77 130

the 0 77 130
people, 0 77 130
and 0 77 130

the 0 77 130
resurrection 0 77 130
from 0 77 130

And 0 77 131
they 0 77 131
laid 0 77 131
hands 0 77 131
on 0 77 131
them, 0 77 131

it 0 77 131

now 0 77 131
eventide. 0 77 131

Howbeit 0 77 132
many 0 77 132
of 0 77 132
them 0 77 132
which 0 77 132
heard 0 77 132
the 0 77 132

the 0 77 132
number 0 77 132
of 0 77 132
the 0 77 132
men 0 77 132
was 0 77 132
about 0 77 132
five 0 77 132
thousand. 0 77 132

it 0 77 133
came 0 77 133
to 0 77 133

at 0 77 133
Jerusalem. 0 77 133

And 0 77 134
when 0 77 134
they 0 77 134
had 0 77 134
set 0 77 134
them 0 77 134
in 0 77 134
the 0 77 134

they 0 77 134
asked, 0 77 134
By 0 77 134
what 0 77 134
power, 0 77 134
or 0 77 134
by 0 77 134
what 0 77 134
name, 0 77 134
have 0 77 134
ye 0 77 134
done 0 77 134
this? 0 77 134

Then 0 77 135
Peter, 0 77 135
filled 0 77 135
with 0 77 135
the 0 77 135
Holy 0 77 135
Ghost, 0 77 135
said 0 77 135
unto 0 77 135
them, 0 77 135
Ye 0 77 135
rulers 0 77 135
of 0 77 135
the 0 77 135
people, 0 77 135
and 0 77 135
elders 0 77 135
of 0 77 135
Israel, 0 77 135

If 0 77 136
we 0 77 136
this 0 77 136
day 0 77 136
be 0 77 136
examined 0 77 136
of 0 77 136
the 0 77 136
good 0 77 136

done 0 77 136
to 0 77 136
the 1 77 136
impotent 1 77 136
man, 1 77 136
by 0 77 136
what 0 77 136
means 0 77 136
he 0 77 136
is 0 77 136
made 0 77 136
whole; 0 77 136

Be 0 77 137
it 0 77 137
known 0 77 137
unto 0 77 137
you 0 77 137
all, 0 77 137
and 0 77 137
to 0 77 137
all 0 77 137
the 0 77 137
people 0 77 137
of 0 77 137
Israel, 0 77 137
that 0 77 137
by 0 77 137
the 0 77 137
name 0 77 137
of 0 77 137
Jesus 0 77 137
Christ 0 77 137
of 0 77 137
Nazareth, 0 77 137
whom 0 77 137
ye 0 77 137
crucified, 0 77 137
whom 0 77 137
God 0 77 137
raised 0 77 137
from 0 77 137
the 0 77 137
dead, 0 77 137
even 0 77 137
by 0 77 137
him 0 77 137
doth 0 77 137
this 0 77 137
man 0 77 137
stand 0 77 137
here 0 77 137
before 0 77 137
you 0 77 137
whole. 0 77 137

This 0 77 138
is 0 77 138
the 0 77 138
stone 0 77 138
which 0 77 138
was 0 77 138
set 0 77 138
at 0 77 138
nought 0 77 138
of 0 77 138
you 0 77 138
builders, 0 77 138
which 0 77 138
is 0 77 138
become 0 77 138
the 0 77 138
head 0 77 138
of 0 77 138
the 0 77 138
corner. 0 77 138

Neither 0 77 139
is 0 77 139
there 0 77 139
salvation 0 77 139
in 0 77 139
any 0 77 139
other: 0 77 139
for 0 77 139
there 0 77 139
is 0 77 139
none 0 77 139
other 0 77 139
name 0 77 139
under 0 77 139
heaven 0 77 139
given 0 77 139
among 0 77 139
men, 0 77 139
whereby 0 77 139
we 0 77 139
must 0 77 139
be 0 77 139
saved. 0 77 139

Now 0 77 140
when 0 77 140
they 0 77 140
saw 0 77 140
the 0 77 140
boldness 0 77 140
of 0 77 140
Peter 0 77 140
and 0 77 140
John, 0 77 140
and 0 77 140
perceived 0 77 140
that 0 77 140
they 0 77 140
were 0 77 140
unlearned 1 77 140
and 1 77 140
ignorant 1 77 140
men, 1 77 140
they 0 77 140
marvelled; 0 77 140
and 0 77 140
they 0 77 140
took 0 77 140
knowledge 0 77 140
of 0 77 140
them, 0 77 140
that 0 77 140
they 0 77 140
had 0 77 140
been 0 77 140
with 0 77 140
Jesus. 0 77 140

And 0 77 141
beholding 0 77 141
the 0 77 141
man 0 77 141
which 0 77 141
was 0 77 141
healed 0 77 141
standing 0 77 141
with 0 77 141
them, 0 77 141
they 0 77 141
could 0 77 141
say 0 77 141
nothing 0 77 141
against 0 77 141
it. 0 77 141

But 0 77 142
when 0 77 142
they 0 77 142
had 0 77 142
commanded 0 77 142
them 0 77 142
to 0 77 142
go 0 77 142
aside 0 77 142
out 0 77 142
of 0 77 142
the 0 77 142
council, 0 77 142
they 0 77 142
conferred 0 77 142
among 0 77 142
themselves, 0 77 142

Saying, 0 77 143
What 0 77 143
shall 0 77 143
we 0 77 143
do 0 77 143
to 0 77 143
these 0 77 143
men? 0 77 143

for 0 77 144
that 0 77 144
indeed 0 77 144
a 0 77 144
notable 0 77 144
miracle 0 77 144
hath 0 77 144
been 0 77 144
done 0 77 144
by 0 77 144
them 0 77 144
is 0 77 144
manifest 0 77 144
to 0 77 144
all 0 77 144
them 0 77 144
that 0 77 144
dwell 0 77 144
in 0 77 144
Jerusalem; 0 77 144
and 0 77 144
we 0 77 144
cannot 0 77 144
deny 0 77 144
it. 0 77 144

But 0 77 145
that 0 77 145
it 0 77 145
spread 0 77 145
no 0 77 145
further 0 77 145
among 0 77 145
the 0 77 145
people, 0 77 145
let 0 77 145
us 0 77 145
straitly 0 77 145
threaten 0 77 145
them, 0 77 145
that 0 77 145
they 0 77 145
speak 0 77 145
henceforth 0 77 145
to 0 77 145
no 0 77 145
man 0 77 145
in 0 77 145
this 0 77 145
name. 0 77 145

And 0 77 146
they 0 77 146
called 0 77 146
them, 0 77 146
and 0 77 146
commanded 0 77 146
them 0 77 146
not 0 77 146
to 0 77 146
speak 0 77 146
at 0 77 146
all 0 77 146
nor 0 77 146
teach 0 77 146
in 0 77 146
the 0 77 146
name 0 77 146
of 0 77 146
Jesus. 0 77 146

But 0 77 147
Peter 0 77 147
and 0 77 147
John 0 77 147
answered 0 77 147
and 0 77 147
said 0 77 147
unto 0 77 147
them, 0 77 147
Whether 0 77 147
it 0 77 147
be 0 77 147
right 0 77 147
in 0 77 147
the 0 77 147
sight 0 77 147
of 0 77 147
God 0 77 147
to 0 77 147
hearken 0 77 147
unto 0 77 147
you 0 77 147
more 0 77 147
than 0 77 147
unto 0 77 147
God, 0 77 147
judge 0 77 147
ye. 0 77 147

For 0 77 148
we 0 77 148
cannot 0 77 148
but 0 77 148
speak 0 77 148
the 0 77 148
things 0 77 148
which 0 77 148
we 0 77 148
have 0 77 148
seen 0 77 148
and 0 77 148
heard.” 0 77 148
Acts 0 77 148
4:2-20 0 77 148

Or 0 77 149
what 0 77 149
of 0 77 149
the 0 77 149
account 0 77 149
found 0 77 149
in 0 77 149
Acts 0 77 149
12:1-11, 0 77 149
where 0 77 149
the 0 77 149
Lord 0 77 149
sent 0 77 149
an 0 77 149
Angel 0 77 149
to 0 77 149
liberate 0 77 149
Peter 0 77 149
from 0 77 149
the 0 77 149
hands 0 77 149
of 0 77 149
tyrants. 1 77 149

“Now 0 77 150
about 0 77 150
that 0 77 150
time 0 77 150
Herod 0 77 150
the 0 77 150
king 0 77 150
stretched 0 77 150
forth 0 77 150
his 0 77 150
hands 0 77 150
to 0 77 150
vex 0 77 150
certain 0 77 150
of 0 77 150
the 0 77 150
church. 0 77 150

And 0 77 151
he 0 77 151
killed 0 77 151
James 0 77 151
the 0 77 151
brother 0 77 151
of 0 77 151
John 0 77 151
with 0 77 151

And 0 77 152
because 0 77 152
he 0 77 152
saw 0 77 152
it 0 77 152
pleased 0 77 152
the 0 77 152
Jews, 0 77 152
he 0 77 152
proceeded 0 77 152
further 0 77 152
to 0 77 152
take 0 77 152
Peter 0 77 152
also. 0 77 152

(Then 0 77 153
were 0 77 153

And 0 77 154
when 0 77 154
he 0 77 154
had 0 77 154
apprehended 0 77 154
him, 0 77 154
he 0 77 154
put 0 77 154
him 0 77 154
in 0 77 154
prison, 0 77 154
and 0 77 154
delivered 0 77 154
him 0 77 154
to 0 77 154
four 0 77 154
quaternions 0 77 154
of 0 77 154
soldiers 0 77 154
to 0 77 154
keep 0 77 154
him; 0 77 154
intending 0 77 154
after 0 77 154
Easter 0 77 154
to 0 77 154
bring 0 77 154
him 0 77 154
forth 0 77 154
to 0 77 154
the 0 77 154
people. 0 77 154

Peter 0 77 155
therefore 0 77 155
was 0 77 155
kept 0 77 155
in 0 77 155
prison: 0 77 155
but 0 77 155
prayer 0 77 155
was 0 77 155
made 0 77 155
without 0 77 155
ceasing 0 77 155
of 0 77 155
the 0 77 155
church 0 77 155
unto 0 77 155
God 0 77 155
for 0 77 155
him. 0 77 155

And 0 77 156
when 0 77 156
Herod 0 77 156
would 0 77 156
have 0 77 156
brought 0 77 156
him 0 77 156
forth, 0 77 156
the 0 77 156
same 0 77 156
night 0 77 156
Peter 0 77 156
was 0 77 156
sleeping 0 77 156
between 0 77 156
two 0 77 156
soldiers, 0 77 156
bound 0 77 156
with 0 77 156
two 0 77 156
chains: 0 77 156
and 0 77 156
the 0 77 156
keepers 0 77 156
before 0 77 156
the 0 77 156
door 0 77 156
kept 0 77 156
the 0 77 156
prison. 0 77 156

And, 0 77 157
behold, 0 77 157
the 0 77 157
angel 0 77 157
of 0 77 157
the 0 77 157
Lord 0 77 157
came 0 77 157
upon 0 77 157
him, 0 77 157
and 0 77 157
a 0 77 157
light 0 77 157
shined 0 77 157
in 0 77 157
the 0 77 157
prison: 0 77 157
and 0 77 157
he 0 77 157
smote 0 77 157
Peter 0 77 157
on 0 77 157
the 0 77 157
side, 0 77 157
and 0 77 157
raised 0 77 157
him 0 77 157
up, 0 77 157
saying, 0 77 157
Arise 0 77 157
up 0 77 157
quickly. 0 77 157

And 0 77 158
his 0 77 158
chains 0 77 158
fell 0 77 158
off 0 77 158
from 0 77 158
his 0 77 158
hands. 0 77 158

And 0 77 159
the 0 77 159
angel 0 77 159
said 0 77 159
unto 0 77 159
him, 0 77 159
Gird 0 77 159
thyself, 0 77 159
and 0 77 159
bind 0 77 159
on 0 77 159
thy 0 77 159
sandals. 0 77 159

And 0 77 160
so 0 77 160
he 0 77 160
did. 0 77 160

And 0 77 161
he 0 77 161
saith 0 77 161
unto 0 77 161
him, 0 77 161
Cast 0 77 161
thy 0 77 161
garment 0 77 161
about 0 77 161
thee, 0 77 161
and 0 77 161
follow 0 77 161
me. 0 77 161

And 0 77 162
he 0 77 162
went 0 77 162
out, 0 77 162
and 0 77 162
followed 0 77 162
him; 0 77 162
and 0 77 162
wist 0 77 162
not 0 77 162
that 0 77 162
it 0 77 162
was 0 77 162
true 0 77 162
which 0 77 162
was 0 77 162
done 0 77 162
by 0 77 162
the 0 77 162
angel; 0 77 162
but 0 77 162
thought 0 77 162
he 0 77 162
saw 0 77 162
a 0 77 162
vision. 0 77 162

When 0 77 163
they 0 77 163
were 0 77 163
past 0 77 163
the 0 77 163
first 0 77 163
and 0 77 163
the 0 77 163
second 0 77 163
ward, 0 77 163
they 0 77 163
came 0 77 163
unto 0 77 163
the 0 77 163
iron 0 77 163
gate 0 77 163
that 0 77 163
leadeth 0 77 163
unto 0 77 163
the 0 77 163
city; 0 77 163
which 0 77 163
opened 0 77 163
to 0 77 163
them 0 77 163
of 0 77 163
his 0 77 163
own 0 77 163
accord: 0 77 163
and 0 77 163
they 0 77 163
went 0 77 163
out, 0 77 163
and 0 77 163
passed 0 77 163
on 0 77 163
through 0 77 163
one 0 77 163
street; 0 77 163
and 0 77 163
forthwith 0 77 163
the 0 77 163
angel 0 77 163
departed 0 77 163
from 0 77 163
him. 0 77 163

And 0 77 164
when 0 77 164
Peter 0 77 164
was 0 77 164
come 0 77 164
to 0 77 164
himself, 0 77 164
he 0 77 164
said, 0 77 164
Now 0 77 164
I 0 77 164
know 0 77 164
of 0 77 164
a 0 77 164
surety, 0 77 164
that 0 77 164
the 0 77 164
Lord 0 77 164
hath 0 77 164
sent 0 77 164
his 0 77 164
angel, 0 77 164
and 0 77 164
hath 0 77 164
delivered 0 77 164
me 0 77 164
out 0 77 164
of 0 77 164
the 0 77 164
hand 0 77 164
of 0 77 164
Herod, 0 77 164
and 0 77 164
from 0 77 164
all 0 77 164
the 0 77 164
expectation 0 77 164
of 0 77 164
the 0 77 164
people 0 77 164
of 0 77 164
the 0 77 164
Jews.” 0 77 164

Over 0 77 165
and 0 77 165
over 0 77 165
again, 0 77 165
you 0 77 165
can 0 77 165
see 0 77 165
that 0 77 165
the 0 77 165
Church 0 77 165
was 0 77 165
to 0 77 165
stand 0 77 165
in 0 77 165
protest 0 77 165
against 0 77 165
the 1 77 165
wicked 1 77 165
that 1 77 165
were 1 77 165
at 1 77 165
war 1 77 165
with 1 77 165
Christ 1 77 165
(Revelation 0 77 165
12:17), 0 77 165
in 0 77 165
dealing 0 77 165
with 0 77 165
not 0 77 165
only 0 77 165
the 1 77 165
corrupt 1 77 165
and 1 77 165
wicked 1 77 165
priests, 1 77 165
but 0 77 165
also 0 77 165
the 1 77 165
corrupt 1 77 165
and 1 77 165
wicked 1 77 165
in 1 77 165
government. 1 77 165

as 0 77 166
well 0 77 166
as 0 77 166
those 0 77 166
who 0 77 166
submitted 0 77 166
to 0 77 166
such. 0 77 166

It 0 77 167
is 0 77 167
important 0 77 167
for 0 77 167
people 0 77 167
to 0 77 167
know 0 77 167
the 0 77 167
Scriptures 0 77 167
(History), 0 77 167
lest 0 77 167
you 0 77 167
find 0 77 167
yourselves 0 77 167
to 0 77 167
be 0 77 167
fighting 0 77 167
against 0 77 167
God 0 77 167
(Acts 0 77 167
5:39). 0 77 167

Nowhere 0 77 168
in 0 77 168
Scripture 0 77 168
can 0 77 168
you 0 77 168
find 0 77 168
the 0 77 168
Lord 0 77 168
telling 0 77 168
His 0 77 168
children 0 77 168
to 0 77 168
submit 0 77 168
to 0 77 168
the 0 77 168
wicked 0 77 168
in 0 77 168
disobedience 0 77 168
to 0 77 168
His 0 77 168
Word. 0 77 168

Nowhere! 1 77 169
