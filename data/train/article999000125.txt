Warren 0
said 0
that 0
AAA 0
made 0
the 0
right 0
decision 0
to 0
remove 0
Patel 0
from 0
the 0
stage 0
due 0
to 0
the 0
nature 0
of 0
his 0
jokes, 0
which 0
contradicted 0
the 0
sensitive 0
nature 0
of 0
the 0
event 0
itself. 0

“The 1
message 1
they 1
were 1
trying 1
to 1
send 1
with 1
the 1
event 1
was 1
opposite 1
to 1
the 1
jokes 1
he 1
was 1
making, 1
and 1
using 1
people’s 1
ethnicity 1
as 1
the 1
crux 1
of 1
his 1
jokes 1
could 1
be 1
funny 1
but 1
still 1
offensive...He 1
definitely 1
wasn’t 1
the 1
most 1
crass 1
comedian 1
I’ve 1
ever 1
heard 1
but 1
for 1
the 1
event 1
it 1
was 1
inappropriate,” 1

However, 0

Elle 0

push 0
the 0
boundaries 0
of 0

culture, 0
she 0
had 0
heard 0

did 0
not 0
find 0
them 0
offensive. 0

“While 0
what 0
some 0
of 0
the 0
things 0
that 0
he 0
said 0
might 0
have 0
been 0
a 0
bit 0
provoking 0
to 0
some 0
of 0
the 0
audience, 0
as 0
someone 0
who 0
watches 0
comedy 0
a 0
lot, 0
none 0
of 0
them 0
were 0
jokes 0
that 0
I 0
hadn’t 0
heard 0
before 0
and 0
none 0
of 0
them 0
were 0
jokes 0
that 0
elicited 0
such 0
a 0
response 0
in 0
my 0
experience,” 0
Ferguson 0
said. 0

“[AAA] 0
should 0
have 0
talked 0
to 0
him 0
beforehand 0
especially 0
because 0
comedy 0
is 0
known 0
for 0
being 0
ground-breaking 0

pushing 0

“I 0
really 0

that 0

Obviously 0
the 0
world 0

not 0
a 0

space 0

just 0
accepting 0
that 0
it’s 0
not 0

continuing 0
to 0

the 0

it… 0
is 0

“When 0

you 0
