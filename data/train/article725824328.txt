he 0 127 15
thought 0 127 15
the 0 127 15

little 0 127 15
bit 0 127 15
more 0 127 15

“He 0 127 18
had 0 127 18
no 0 127 18

… 0 127 18
During 0 127 18
Obama’s 0 127 18
presidential 0 127 18
campaign, 0 127 18
conservatives 0 127 18
pushed 0 127 18

about 0 127 18

supposed 0 127 18

Farrakhan’s 0 127 21
eventual 0 127 21
failure 0 127 21
suggests 0 127 21
to 0 127 21
Obama 0 127 21
that’s 0 127 21
there 0 127 21
is 0 127 21
more 0 127 21
economic 0 127 21

During 0 127 22
the 0 127 22
2008 0 127 22
presidential 0 127 22
election, 0 127 22
conservatives 0 127 22
questioned 0 127 22
the 0 127 22
indirect 0 127 22
ties 0 127 22
between 0 127 22
Farrakhan 0 127 22
and 0 127 22
Obama, 0 127 22
who 0 127 22
attended 0 127 22
a 0 127 22
church 0 127 22
that 0 127 22
gave 0 127 22
Farrakhan 0 127 22
an 0 127 22
award. 0 127 22

Obama’s 0 127 23
“spiritual 1 127 23
advisor” 1 127 23
Rev. 0 127 23

Jeremiah 0 127 24
Wright 0 127 24

in 0 127 24
November 0 127 24
2007, 0 127 24
but 0 127 24
the 0 127 24
story 0 127 24
didn’t 0 127 24
make 0 127 24
the 0 127 24
press 0 127 24
until 0 127 24
the 0 127 24
following 0 127 24
year. 0 127 24

Similarly, 0 127 25
very 0 127 25
little 0 127 25
media 0 127 25
attention 0 127 25
was 0 127 25
paid 0 127 25
to 0 127 25
the 0 127 25
close 0 127 25
relationship 0 127 25
between 0 127 25
Obama’s 0 127 25
fundraiser 0 127 25
and 0 127 25
private 0 127 25
mentor 0 127 25
Tony 0 127 25
Rezko 0 127 25
and 0 127 25
the 0 127 25
Nation 0 127 25
of 0 127 25
Islam, 0 127 25
even 0 127 25
though 0 127 25
Rezko’s 0 127 25
role 0 127 25
was 0 127 25
business 0 127 25
manager 0 127 25
for 0 127 25
Nation 0 127 25
of 0 127 25
Islam 0 127 25
assets, 0 127 25
such 0 127 25
as 0 127 25
the 0 127 25
career 0 127 25
of 0 127 25
Muhammad 0 127 25
Ali. 0 127 25

But 0 127 26
after 0 127 26
all, 0 127 26
what 0 127 26
could 0 127 26
be 0 127 26
more 0 127 26
boring 0 127 26
than 0 127 26
a 0 127 26
story 0 127 26
