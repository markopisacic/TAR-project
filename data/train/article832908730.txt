Special 0 429 1

concluded 0 429 1
his 0 429 1
22-month 0 429 1
Russia 0 429 1
investigation 0 429 1
and 0 429 1

General 0 429 1
William 0 429 1
Barr 0 429 1
on 0 429 1
Friday, 0 429 1
triggering 0 429 1
a 0 429 1
clamor 0 429 1
from 0 429 1
Congress 0 429 1
to 0 429 1
see 0 429 1
the 0 429 1
findings. 0 429 1

A 0 429 2
Justice 0 429 2
Department 0 429 2
official 0 429 2
told 0 429 2
the 0 429 2
Associated 0 429 2
Press 0 429 2
that 0 429 2
Mueller 0 429 2
is 0 429 2
not 0 429 2
recommending 0 429 2
any 0 429 2
further 0 429 2
indictments. 0 429 2

In 0 429 3
a 0 429 3
letter 0 429 3
to 0 429 3
the 0 429 3
heads 0 429 3
of 0 429 3
the 0 429 3
Senate 0 429 3
and 0 429 3
House 0 429 3
judiciary 0 429 3
committees, 0 429 3
Barr 0 429 3
described 0 429 3
Mueller’s 0 429 3
submission 0 429 3
as 0 429 3
a 0 429 3
“confidential 0 429 3
report 0 429 3
explaining 0 429 3
the 0 429 3
prosecution 0 429 3
or 0 429 3
declination 0 429 3
decisions 0 429 3
he 0 429 3
has 0 429 3
reached.” 0 429 3

“I 0 429 4
am 0 429 4
reviewing 0 429 4
the 0 429 4
report 0 429 4
and 0 429 4
anticipate 0 429 4
that 0 429 4
I 0 429 4
may 0 429 4
be 0 429 4
in 0 429 4
a 0 429 4
position 0 429 4
to 0 429 4
advise 0 429 4
you 0 429 4
of 0 429 4
the 0 429 4
Special 0 429 4
Counsel’s 0 429 4
principal 0 429 4
conclusions 0 429 4
as 0 429 4
soon 0 429 4
as 0 429 4
this 0 429 4
weekend,” 0 429 4
the 0 429 4
letter 0 429 4
said. 0 429 4

Barr 0 429 5
did 0 429 5
not 0 429 5
detail 0 429 5
what 0 429 5
the 0 429 5
report 0 429 5
contains, 0 429 5
but 0 429 5
did 0 429 5
say 0 429 5
that 0 429 5
the 0 429 5
Justice 0 429 5
Department 0 429 5
did 0 429 5
not 0 429 5
overrule 0 429 5
any 0 429 5
decision 0 429 5
Mueller 0 429 5
made. 0 429 5

Barr 0 429 6
said 0 429 6
he 0 429 6
will 0 429 6
consult 0 429 6
with 0 429 6
Mueller 0 429 6
and 0 429 6
Deputy 0 429 6
Attorney 0 429 6
General 0 429 6
Rod 0 429 6
Rosenstein, 0 429 6
who 0 429 6
has 0 429 6
mostly 0 429 6
overseen 0 429 6
the 0 429 6
Special 0 429 6
Counsel’s 0 429 6
Office, 0 429 6
about 0 429 6
“what 0 429 6
other 0 429 6
information 0 429 6
from 0 429 6
the 0 429 6
report” 0 429 6
can 0 429 6
be 0 429 6
released 0 429 6
to 0 429 6
Congress 0 429 6
and 0 429 6
the 0 429 6
public. 0 429 6

The 0 429 7
White 0 429 7
House 0 429 7
and 0 429 7
President 0 429 7
Trump’s 0 429 7
lawyers 0 429 7
said 0 429 7
the 0 429 7
next 0 429 7
decisions 0 429 7
are 0 429 7
up 0 429 7
to 0 429 7
Barr. 0 429 7

There 0 429 8
is 0 429 8
a 0 429 8
possibility 0 429 8
that 0 429 8
Barr 0 429 8
releases 0 429 8
two 0 429 8
separate 0 429 8
reports. 0 429 8

One 0 429 9
would 0 429 9
summarize 0 429 9
Mueller’s 0 429 9
findings 0 429 9
without 0 429 9
including 0 429 9
classified 0 429 9
information 0 429 9
and 0 429 9
would 0 429 9
be 0 429 9
given 0 429 9
to 0 429 9
Congress—and 0 429 9
would 0 429 9
then 0 429 9
most 0 429 9
likely 0 429 9
find 0 429 9
its 0 429 9
way 0 429 9
out 0 429 9
into 0 429 9
the 0 429 9
public. 0 429 9

The 0 429 10
other 0 429 10
would 0 429 10
be 0 429 10
given 0 429 10
to 0 429 10
a 0 429 10
smaller 0 429 10
group 0 429 10
of 0 429 10
lawmakers 0 429 10
who 0 429 10
head 0 429 10
major 0 429 10
congressional 0 429 10
committees, 0 429 10
such 0 429 10
as 0 429 10
the 0 429 10
House 0 429 10
and 0 429 10
Senate 0 429 10
intelligence 0 429 10
committees. 0 429 10

Rep. 0 429 11
Adam 0 429 11
Schiff 0 429 11
(D-CA), 0 429 11
chairman 0 429 11
of 0 429 11
House 0 429 11
Intelligence, 0 429 11
called 0 429 11
for 0 429 11
transparency. 0 429 11

“Mueller’s 0 429 12
investigation 0 429 12
began 0 429 12
as 0 429 12
a 0 429 12
counterintelligence 0 429 12
inquiry 0 429 12
into 0 429 12
whether 0 429 12
individuals 0 429 12
associated 0 429 12
with 0 429 12
the 0 429 12
Trump 0 429 12
campaign 0 429 12
were 0 429 12
compromised 0 429 12
by 0 429 12
a 0 429 12
foreign 0 429 12
power. 0 429 12

By 0 429 13
law, 0 429 13
that 0 429 13
evidence 0 429 13
he 0 429 13
uncovered 0 429 13
must 0 429 13
be 0 429 13
shared 0 429 13
with 0 429 13
our 0 429 13
Committee,” 0 429 13
he 0 429 13
said 0 429 13
in 0 429 13
a 0 429 13
tweet. 0 429 13

“And 0 429 14
his 0 429 14
report 0 429 14
must 0 429 14
also 0 429 14
be 0 429 14
made 0 429 14
public. 0 429 14

Now.” 1 429 15

Trump 0 429 16
has 0 429 16
previously 0 429 16
said 0 429 16
he 0 429 16
supports 0 429 16
the 0 429 16
idea 0 429 16
of 0 429 16
making 0 429 16
the 0 429 16
report 0 429 16
public. 0 429 16

“I 0 429 17
don’t 0 429 17
mind,” 0 429 17
he 0 429 17
has 0 429 17
said. 0 429 17

“I 0 429 18
mean, 0 429 18
frankly, 0 429 18
I 0 429 18
told 0 429 18
the 0 429 18
House, 0 429 18
‘If 0 429 18
you 0 429 18
want, 0 429 18
let 0 429 18
them 0 429 18
see 0 429 18
it.’” 0 429 18

Trump 0 429 19
has 0 429 19
also 0 429 19
vigorously 0 429 19
denied 0 429 19
any 0 429 19
wrongdoing 0 429 19
and 0 429 19
has 0 429 19
repeatedly 0 429 19
branded 0 429 19
the 0 429 19
probe 0 429 19
as 0 429 19
a 0 429 19
“total 1 429 19
witch 1 429 19
hunt.” 1 429 19

Mueller 0 429 20
will 0 429 20
remain 0 429 20
as 0 429 20
special 0 429 20
counsel 0 429 20
for 0 429 20
a 0 429 20
period 0 429 20
of 0 429 20
time 0 429 20
as 0 429 20
he 0 429 20
and 0 429 20
a 0 429 20
small 0 429 20
contingent 0 429 20
of 0 429 20
staff 0 429 20
close 0 429 20
the 0 429 20
office, 0 429 20
a 0 429 20
Justice 0 429 20
Department 0 429 20
spokesperson 0 429 20
reportedly 0 429 20
said. 0 429 20

The 0 429 21
handover 0 429 21
of 0 429 21
the 0 429 21
report 0 429 21
marks 0 429 21
the 0 429 21
end 0 429 21
of 0 429 21
an 0 429 21
investigation 0 429 21
that 0 429 21
has 0 429 21
for 0 429 21
nearly 0 429 21
two 0 429 21
years 0 429 21
transfixed 1 429 21
the 1 429 21
nation, 1 429 21
yielded 0 429 21
dozens 0 429 21
of 0 429 21
indictments 0 429 21
and 0 429 21
convictions, 0 429 21
and 0 429 21
brought 0 429 21
down 0 429 21
a 0 429 21
handful 0 429 21
of 0 429 21
Trump’s 0 429 21
closest 0 429 21
advisers. 0 429 21

The 0 429 22
Special 0 429 22
Counsel’s 0 429 22
Office 0 429 22
was 0 429 22
tasked 0 429 22
broadly 0 429 22
with 0 429 22
investigating 0 429 22
any 0 429 22
links 0 429 22
or 0 429 22
coordination 0 429 22
between 0 429 22
the 0 429 22
Russian 0 429 22
government 0 429 22
and 0 429 22
individuals 0 429 22
associated 0 429 22
with 0 429 22
the 0 429 22
Trump 0 429 22
campaign, 0 429 22
as 0 429 22
well 0 429 22
as 0 429 22
any 0 429 22
matters 0 429 22
that 0 429 22
arose 0 429 22
directly 0 429 22
from 0 429 22
the 0 429 22
probe. 0 429 22

However, 0 429 23
the 0 429 23
scope 0 429 23
of 0 429 23
the 0 429 23
investigation 0 429 23
seems 0 429 23
to 1 429 23
have 1 429 23
bled 1 429 23
outside 1 429 23
those 1 429 23
lines. 1 429 23

Several 0 429 24
witnesses, 0 429 24
for 0 429 24
example, 0 429 24
have 0 429 24
been 0 429 24
questioned 0 429 24
about 0 429 24
other 0 429 24
countries’ 0 429 24
efforts 0 429 24
to 0 429 24
meddle 0 429 24
in 0 429 24
American 1 429 24
politics, 0 429 24
including 0 429 24
Saudi 0 429 24
Arabia, 0 429 24
Israel, 0 429 24
the 0 429 24
UAE 0 429 24
and 0 429 24
Qatar. 0 429 24

So 0 429 25
far, 0 429 25
the 0 429 25
Special 0 429 25
Counsel’s 0 429 25
Office 0 429 25
has 0 429 25
indicted 0 429 25
or 0 429 25
obtained 0 429 25
guilty 0 429 25
pleas 0 429 25
from 0 429 25
34 0 429 25
people 0 429 25
and 0 429 25
three 0 429 25
companies. 0 429 25

Six 0 429 26
of 0 429 26
those 0 429 26
are 0 429 26
former 0 429 26
Trump 0 429 26
associates, 0 429 26
and 0 429 26
25 0 429 26
of 0 429 26
them 0 429 26
are 0 429 26
Russians. 0 429 26

No 0 429 27
Americans 0 429 27
have 0 429 27
been 0 429 27
charged 0 429 27
with 0 429 27
conspiring 0 429 27
with 0 429 27
Russians 0 429 27
to 0 429 27
meddle 0 429 27
in 0 429 27
the 0 429 27
2016 0 429 27
elections—at 0 429 27
least 0 429 27
none 0 429 27
the 0 429 27
public 0 429 27
knows 0 429 27
about. 0 429 27

But 0 429 28
major 0 429 28
Trumpworld 1 429 28
figures 1 429 28
were 0 429 28
charged 0 429 28
with 0 429 28
a 0 429 28
variety 0 429 28
of 0 429 28
other 0 429 28
crimes, 0 429 28
including 0 429 28
former 0 429 28
National 0 429 28

Adviser 0 429 28

and 0 429 28

Michael 0 429 28
Cohen. 0 429 28

Cohen 0 429 29
has 0 429 29
been 0 429 29
sentenced 0 429 29
to 0 429 29
three 0 429 29
years 0 429 29
in 0 429 29

he 0 429 29
committed 0 429 29
while 0 429 29
working 0 429 29

with 0 429 29
his 0 429 29

Manafort 0 429 30
was 0 429 30
sentenced 0 429 30
in 0 429 30
both 0 429 30
Virginia 0 429 30
and 0 429 30
in 0 429 30
Washington 0 429 30
and 0 429 30

serve 0 429 30
about 0 429 30
seven 0 429 30

In 0 429 31
Washington, 0 429 31
Manafort 0 429 31
was 0 429 31
sentenced 0 429 31
for 0 429 31

conspiring 0 429 31
against 0 429 31
the 0 429 31

He 0 429 32

The 0 429 33

said 0 429 33
in 0 429 33
a 0 429 33

filing 0 429 33
last 0 429 33
