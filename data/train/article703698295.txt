In 0 75 5
a 0 75 5
letter 0 75 5
made 0 75 5
public 0 75 5
November 0 75 5
1st, 0 75 5
Fr. 0 75 5

Weinandy, 0 75 6
a 0 75 6
former 0 75 6
chief 0 75 6
of 0 75 6
staff 0 75 6
for 0 75 6
the 0 75 6
U.S. 0 75 6
Bishops’ 0 75 6
Committee 0 75 6
on 0 75 6
Doctrine 0 75 6
and 0 75 6
a 0 75 6
member 0 75 6
of 0 75 6
the 0 75 6
Vatican’s 0 75 6
International 0 75 6
Theological 0 75 6
Commission, 0 75 6
warned 0 75 6
Pope 0 75 6
Francis 0 75 6
that 0 75 6
he 0 75 6
has 0 75 6
caused 0 75 6
“chronic 0 75 6
confusion” 0 75 6
among 0 75 6
the 0 75 6
faithful 0 75 6
and 0 75 6
bishops. 0 75 6

He 0 75 7
wrote 0 75 7
to 0 75 7
the 0 75 7
pope, 0 75 7
“To 1 75 7
teach 1 75 7
with 1 75 7
such 1 75 7
an 1 75 7
intentional 1 75 7
lack 1 75 7
of 1 75 7
clarity 1 75 7
inevitably 1 75 7
risks 1 75 7
sinning 1 75 7
against 1 75 7
the 1 75 7
Holy 1 75 7
Spirit, 1 75 7
the 1 75 7
Spirit 1 75 7
of 1 75 7
truth.” 1 75 7
He 0 75 7
added 0 75 7
that 0 75 7
Catholics 0 75 7
are 0 75 7
“disconcerted” 0 75 7
by 0 75 7
the 0 75 7
appointment 0 75 7
of 0 75 7
bishops 0 75 7
“who 0 75 7
seem 0 75 7
not 0 75 7
merely 0 75 7
open 0 75 7
to 0 75 7
those 0 75 7
who 0 75 7
hold 0 75 7
views 0 75 7
counter 0 75 7
to 0 75 7
Christian 0 75 7
belief, 0 75 7
but 0 75 7
who 0 75 7
support 0 75 7
and 0 75 7
even 0 75 7
defend 0 75 7
them.” 0 75 7

In 0 75 8
an 0 75 8
interview 0 75 8
yesterday 0 75 8
with 0 75 8
John 0 75 8
Allen’s 0 75 8
Crux, 0 75 8
he 0 75 8
added, 0 75 8
more 0 75 8
prophetically 0 75 8
than 0 75 8
he 0 75 8
had 0 75 8
perhaps 0 75 8
intended, 0 75 8
“I 0 75 8
don’t 0 75 8
think 0 75 8
anyone 0 75 8
can, 0 75 8
or 0 75 8
should, 0 75 8
associate 0 75 8
my 0 75 8
letter 0 75 8
with 0 75 8
the 0 75 8
USCCB 0 75 8
or 0 75 8
the 0 75 8
American 0 75 8
bishops. 0 75 8

Neither 0 75 9
was 0 75 9
involved 0 75 9
in 0 75 9
my 0 75 9
writing 0 75 9
the 0 75 9
letter, 0 75 9
and 0 75 9
its 0 75 9
publication 0 75 9
will 0 75 9
be 0 75 9
news 0 75 9
to 0 75 9
them.” 0 75 9

“Bishops 0 75 10
are 0 75 10
quick 0 75 10
learners,” 0 75 10
he 0 75 10
wrote 0 75 10
in 0 75 10
his 0 75 10
letter, 0 75 10
“and 0 75 10
what 0 75 10
many 0 75 10
have 0 75 10
learned 0 75 10
from 0 75 10
your 0 75 10
pontificate 0 75 10
is 0 75 10
not 0 75 10
that 0 75 10
you 0 75 10
are 0 75 10
open 0 75 10
to 0 75 10
criticism, 0 75 10
but 0 75 10
that 0 75 10
you 0 75 10
resent 0 75 10
it,” 0 75 10
claiming 0 75 10
that 0 75 10
many 0 75 10
bishops 0 75 10
don’t 1 75 10
speak 1 75 10
out 1 75 10
publicly 1 75 10
for 1 75 10
fear 1 75 10
they 1 75 10
will 1 75 10
be 1 75 10
“marginalized 1 75 10
or 1 75 10
worse.” 1 75 10

And 0 75 11
sure 0 75 11
enough, 0 75 11
within 0 75 11
hours 0 75 11
of 0 75 11
making 0 75 11
his 0 75 11
letter 0 75 11
public, 0 75 11
we 0 75 11
learned 0 75 11
that 0 75 11
Fr. 0 75 11

Weinandy 0 75 12
had 0 75 12
been 0 75 12
given 1 75 12
the 1 75 12
boot. 1 75 12

Of 0 75 13
course, 0 75 13
the 0 75 13
Twitterverse 0 75 13
is 0 75 13
busy 0 75 13
commenting 0 75 13
on 0 75 13
the 0 75 13
irony: 0 75 13
how 0 75 13
a 0 75 13
man 0 75 13
expressing 0 75 13
grave 0 75 13
concerns 0 75 13
that 0 75 13
there 0 75 13
is 0 75 13
an 0 75 13
atmosphere 0 75 13
of 0 75 13
fear 0 75 13
of 0 75 13
being 0 75 13
punished 0 75 13
for 0 75 13
expressing 0 75 13
grave 0 75 13
concerns, 0 75 13
was 0 75 13
immediately 0 75 13
fired. 0 75 13

Perhaps 0 75 14
the 0 75 14
most 0 75 14
astonishing 0 75 14
aspect 0 75 14
of 0 75 14
this 0 75 14
little 1 75 14
incident 1 75 14
is 0 75 14
just 0 75 14
how 0 75 14
completely 0 75 14
blind 0 75 14
the 0 75 14
US 0 75 14
bishops 0 75 14
– 0 75 14
as 0 75 14
with 0 75 14
nearly 0 75 14
all 0 75 14
the 0 75 14
episcopate 0 75 14
– 0 75 14
are 0 75 14
to 0 75 14
what 0 75 14
political 0 75 14
analysts 0 75 14
call 0 75 14
the 0 75 14
“optics”. 0 75 14

Political 0 75 15
consultants 0 75 15
often 0 75 15
ask: 0 75 15
how 0 75 15
does 0 75 15
it 0 75 15
look? 0 75 15

And 0 75 16
it 0 75 16
looks 0 75 16
extremely 1 75 16
bad. 1 75 16

As 0 75 17
though 0 75 17
the 0 75 17
fog 0 75 17
of 0 75 17
irony 0 75 17
weren’t 0 75 17
thick 0 75 17
enough, 0 75 17
in 0 75 17
response 0 75 17
to 0 75 17
the 0 75 17
outrage 0 75 17
from 0 75 17
Catholics, 0 75 17
the 0 75 17
USCCB 0 75 17
has 0 75 17
done 0 75 17
what 0 75 17
all 0 75 17
the 0 75 17
other 0 75 17
members 0 75 17
of 0 75 17
Pope 0 75 17
Francis’ 0 75 17
cabal 0 75 17
have 0 75 17
done 0 75 17
and 0 75 17
started 0 75 17
blocking 0 75 17
critics 0 75 17
from 0 75 17
its 0 75 17
Twitter 0 75 17
account. 0 75 17

Which, 0 75 18
it 0 75 18
must 0 75 18
be 0 75 18
said, 0 75 18
only 0 75 18
proves 0 75 18
Fr. 0 75 18

Weinandy’s 0 75 19
point 0 75 19
once 0 75 19
again. 0 75 19

Some 0 75 20
of 0 75 20
the 0 75 20
criticism 0 75 20
has 0 75 20
been 0 75 20
unusually 0 75 20
sharp. 0 75 20

Fr. 0 75 21

Hunwicke 0 75 22
wrote 0 75 22
this 0 75 22
afternoon, 0 75 22
“This 0 75 22

the 0 75 22

Just 0 75 23
as 0 75 23
Tom 0 75 23
Weinandy 0 75 23
has, 0 75 23
in 0 75 23
effect, 0 75 23
just 0 75 23
said.” 0 75 23

As 0 75 24
I 0 75 24
write 0 75 24
this, 0 75 24
the 0 75 24
outrage 0 75 24
is 0 75 24
doing 0 75 24
the 0 75 24
opposite 0 75 24
of 0 75 24
dying 0 75 24
down, 0 75 24
and 0 75 24
is 0 75 24
surely 0 75 24
a 0 75 24
sign 0 75 24
of 0 75 24
how 0 75 24
fed 0 75 24
up 0 75 24
Catholics 0 75 24
– 0 75 24
even 0 75 24
those 0 75 24
who 0 75 24
would 0 75 24
never 0 75 24
identify 0 75 24
themselves 0 75 24
as 0 75 24
Traditionalists 0 75 24
– 0 75 24
have 0 75 24
become 0 75 24
with 0 75 24
this 0 75 24
pope 0 75 24
and 0 75 24
his 0 75 24
cadre 0 75 24
of 0 75 24
episcopal 1 75 24
bullies. 1 75 24

In 0 75 25
his 0 75 25
letter, 0 75 25
Fr. 0 75 25

Weinandy 0 75 26
made 0 75 26
a 0 75 26
point 0 75 26
of 0 75 26
stating 0 75 26
that 0 75 26
he 0 75 26
is 0 75 26
not 0 75 26
signatory 0 75 26
to 0 75 26
the 0 75 26

or 0 75 26
any 0 75 26
other 0 75 26
public 0 75 26
declaration 0 75 26
against 0 75 26
Pope 0 75 26
Francis’ 0 75 26
agenda. 0 75 26

In 0 75 27
fact, 0 75 27
a 0 75 27
former 0 75 27
student 0 75 27
of 0 75 27
his 0 75 27
wrote 0 75 27
to 0 75 27
me 0 75 27
today 0 75 27
saying, 0 75 27

“I 0 75 28
see 0 75 28
that 0 75 28
Fr. 0 75 28

Thomas 0 75 29
Weinandy 0 75 29
has 0 75 29
been 0 75 29
squashed. 0 75 29

He 0 75 30
was 0 75 30
one 0 75 30
of 0 75 30
my 0 75 30
professors 0 75 30
in 0 75 30
Patristics 0 75 30
at 0 75 30
Oxford 0 75 30
and 0 75 30
he 0 75 30
was 0 75 30
one 0 75 30
of 0 75 30
the 0 75 30
most 0 75 30
mild-mannered, 0 75 30
least 0 75 30
confrontational, 0 75 30
kindest 0 75 30
academics 0 75 30
one 0 75 30
could 0 75 30
have 0 75 30
hoped 0 75 30
to 0 75 30
meet. 0 75 30

To 0 75 31
me, 0 75 31
the 0 75 31
fact 0 75 31
that 0 75 31
he 0 75 31
has 0 75 31
chosen 0 75 31
to 0 75 31
write 0 75 31
to 0 75 31
express 0 75 31
his 0 75 31
concern 0 75 31
about 0 75 31
the 0 75 31
crisis 0 75 31
in 0 75 31
the 0 75 31
church 0 75 31
and 0 75 31
the 0 75 31
papacy 0 75 31
is 0 75 31
very 0 75 31
significant. 0 75 31

He 0 75 32
is 0 75 32
neither 0 75 32
a 0 75 32
traditionalist, 0 75 32
nor 0 75 32
a 0 75 32
controversialist, 0 75 32
but 0 75 32
a 0 75 32
humble 0 75 32
and 0 75 32
straightforward 0 75 32
Friar 0 75 32
who 0 75 32
is 0 75 32
clear-thinking 0 75 32
and 0 75 32
entirely 0 75 32
loyal 0 75 32
to 0 75 32
the 0 75 32
Church 0 75 32
and 0 75 32
Her 0 75 32
teaching. 0 75 32

I 0 75 33
would 0 75 33
be 0 75 33
surprised 0 75 33
now 0 75 33
if 0 75 33
we 0 75 33
were 0 75 33
not 0 75 33
see 0 75 33
more 0 75 33
of 0 75 33
this 0 75 33
sort 0 75 33
of 0 75 33
letter/exercise 0 75 33
of 0 75 33
conscience. 0 75 33

I 0 75 34
imagine 0 75 34
that 0 75 34
it’s 0 75 34
going 0 75 34
to 0 75 34
become 0 75 34
harder 0 75 34
and 0 75 34
harder 0 75 34
for 0 75 34
men 0 75 34
of 0 75 34
conscience 0 75 34
and 0 75 34
position 0 75 34
to 0 75 34
sit 0 75 34
on 0 75 34
the 0 75 34
fence.” 0 75 34

When 0 75 35
I 0 75 35
posted 0 75 35
it, 0 75 35
this 0 75 35
assessment 0 75 35
was 0 75 35
backed 0 75 35
up 0 75 35
by 0 75 35
Joseph 0 75 35
Shaw, 0 75 35
the 0 75 35

the 0 75 35
UK’s 0 75 35
Latin 0 75 35
Mass 0 75 35
Society 0 75 35
and 0 75 35
the 0 75 35
spokesman 0 75 35
for 0 75 35
the 0 75 35
Filial 0 75 35
Correction, 0 75 35
who 0 75 35
wrote, 0 75 35
“This 0 75 35
is 0 75 35
absolutely 0 75 35
right. 0 75 35

Not 0 75 36
a 0 75 36
man 0 75 36
to 0 75 36

out 0 75 36
confrontation.” 0 75 36

The 0 75 37
Crux 0 75 37
piece 0 75 37
offered 0 75 37
a 0 75 37
succinct 0 75 37
bullet 0 75 37
point 0 75 37
list 0 75 37
of 0 75 37
Fr. 0 75 37

Weinandy’s 0 75 38
concerns. 0 75 38

He 0 75 39
said 0 75 39
the 0 75 39
pope 0 75 39
is… 0 75 39

Fostering 0 75 40
“chronic 0 75 40
confusion.” 0 75 40

“Demeaning” 0 75 41
the 0 75 41
importance 0 75 41
of 0 75 41
doctrine. 0 75 41

Appointing 0 75 42
bishops 0 75 42
who 1 75 42
“scandalize” 1 75 42
believers 1 75 42
with 0 75 42
dubious 0 75 42
“teaching 0 75 42
and 0 75 42
pastoral 0 75 42
practice.” 0 75 42

Giving 0 75 43
prelates 0 75 43
who 0 75 43
object 0 75 43
the 0 75 43
impression 0 75 43
they’ll 1 75 43
be 1 75 43
“marginalized 1 75 43
or 1 75 43
worse” 1 75 43
if 1 75 43
they 1 75 43
speak 1 75 43
out. 1 75 43

Causing 0 75 44
faithful 0 75 44
Catholics 0 75 44
to 0 75 44
“lose 0 75 44
confidence 0 75 44
in 0 75 44
their 0 75 44
supreme 1 75 44
shepherd.” 1 75 44

Our 0 75 45
friend 0 75 45
Edward 0 75 45
Pentin 0 75 45
has 0 75 45
reproduced 0 75 45
the 0 75 45
full 0 75 45
text 0 75 45
of 0 75 45
the 0 75 45
letter 0 75 45
at 0 75 45
the 0 75 45
National 0 75 45
Catholic 0 75 45
Register 0 75 45
which 0 75 45
is 0 75 45
definitely 0 75 45
worth 0 75 45
a 0 75 45
read. 0 75 45

Fr. 0 75 46

Weinandy 0 75 47
sent 0 75 47
the 0 75 47
letter 0 75 47
to 0 75 47
the 0 75 47
pope 0 75 47
on 0 75 47
July 0 75 47
31, 0 75 47
the 0 75 47
Feast 0 75 47
of 0 75 47
St. 0 75 47
Ignatius 0 75 47
of 0 75 47
Loyola. 0 75 47

Like 0 75 48
the 0 75 48
Dubia 0 75 48
cardinals, 0 75 48
he 0 75 48
said 0 75 48
he 0 75 48
made 0 75 48
it 0 75 48
public 0 75 48
only 0 75 48
after 0 75 48
the 0 75 48
pope 0 75 48
had 0 75 48
ignored 0 75 48
it 0 75 48
for 0 75 48
months. 0 75 48

Notable 0 75 49
in 0 75 49
his 0 75 49
critique 0 75 49
is 0 75 49
its 0 75 49
distinct 0 75 49
pastoral 0 75 49
flavour, 0 75 49
his 0 75 49
concern 0 75 49
on 0 75 49
the 0 75 49
effect 0 75 49
the 0 75 49
situation 0 75 49
is 0 75 49
having 0 75 49
on 0 75 49
ordinary 0 75 49
people. 0 75 49

The 0 75 50
pope, 0 75 50
he 0 75 50
said, 0 75 50
seems 0 75 50
“to 0 75 50
censor 0 75 50
and 0 75 50
even 0 75 50
mock” 0 75 50
critics 0 75 50
of 0 75 50
Amoris 0 75 50
Laetitia 0 75 50
for 0 75 50
their 0 75 50
desire 0 75 50
to 0 75 50
interpret 0 75 50
it 0 75 50
in 0 75 50
keeping 0 75 50
with 0 75 50
Catholic 0 75 50
teaching, 0 75 50
and 0 75 50
in 0 75 50
doing 0 75 50
so 0 75 50
is 0 75 50
committing 0 75 50
a 0 75 50
“kind 0 75 50
of 0 75 50
calumny…alien 0 75 50
to 0 75 50
the 0 75 50
nature 0 75 50
of 0 75 50
the 0 75 50
Petrine 0 75 50
ministry.” 0 75 50

In 0 75 51
an 0 75 51
interview 0 75 51
with 0 75 51
Crux, 0 75 51
Weinandy 0 75 51
said 0 75 51
he 0 75 51
is 0 75 51
not 0 75 51
afraid 0 75 51
of 0 75 51
reprisals 0 75 51
but 0 75 51
“more 0 75 51
concerned 0 75 51
about 0 75 51
the 0 75 51
good 0 75 51
that 0 75 51
my 0 75 51
letter 0 75 51
might 0 75 51
do.” 0 75 51
The 0 75 51
letter 0 75 51
“expresses 0 75 51
the 0 75 51
concerns 0 75 51
of 0 75 51
many 0 75 51
more 0 75 51
people 0 75 51
than 0 75 51
just 0 75 51
me, 0 75 51
ordinary 0 75 51
people 0 75 51
who’ve 0 75 51
come 0 75 51
to 0 75 51
me 0 75 51
with 0 75 51
their 0 75 51
questions 0 75 51
and 0 75 51
apprehensions. 0 75 51

I 0 75 52
wanted 0 75 52
them 0 75 52
to 0 75 52
know 0 75 52
that 0 75 52
I 0 75 52
listened.” 0 75 52

“I 0 75 53
have 1 75 53
done 1 75 53
what 1 75 53
I 1 75 53
believe 1 75 53
God 1 75 53
wanted 1 75 53
me 1 75 53
to 1 75 53
do,[1]” 1 75 53
he 0 75 53
said. 0 75 53

In 0 75 54
fact, 0 75 54
Fr. 0 75 54

Weinandy 0 75 55
has 0 75 55
bolstered 1 75 55
my 1 75 55
own 1 75 55
“Great 1 75 55
Clarifier” 1 75 55
theory, 1 75 55
saying 0 75 55
that 0 75 55
this 0 75 55
pontificate, 0 75 55
and 0 75 55
the 0 75 55
lack 0 75 55
of 0 75 55
response 0 75 55
to 0 75 55
it 0 75 55
from 0 75 55
priests 0 75 55
and 0 75 55
bishops, 0 75 55
is 0 75 55
being 0 75 55
allowed 0 75 55
by 0 75 55
God 0 75 55
in 0 75 55
order 0 75 55
to 0 75 55
reveal 0 75 55
“just 0 75 55
how 0 75 55
weak 0 75 55
is 0 75 55
the 0 75 55
faith 0 75 55
of 0 75 55
many 0 75 55
within 0 75 55
the 0 75 55
Church,” 0 75 55
He 0 75 55
added 0 75 55
that 0 75 55
Francis 0 75 55
has 0 75 55
revealed 0 75 55
that 0 75 55
many 0 75 55
in 0 75 55
the 0 75 55
Church 0 75 55
“hold 0 75 55
harmful 0 75 55
theological 0 75 55
and 0 75 55
pastoral 0 75 55
views.” 0 75 55

Which 0 75 56
inevitably 0 75 56
brings 0 75 56
to 0 75 56
mind 0 75 56
other 0 75 56
responses 0 75 56
that 0 75 56
have 0 75 56
not 0 75 56
been 0 75 56
quite 0 75 56
so 0 75 56
clear, 0 75 56
nor 0 75 56
so 0 75 56
pastoral. 0 75 56

When 0 75 57
Cardinal 0 75 57
Muller 0 75 57
was 0 75 57
removed 0 75 57
abruptly 0 75 57
from 0 75 57
his 0 75 57
position 0 75 57
as 0 75 57
head 0 75 57
of 0 75 57
the 0 75 57
CDF, 0 75 57
the 0 75 57
conservative 0 75 57
Catholic 0 75 57
world 0 75 57
wailed 0 75 57
that 0 75 57
it 0 75 57
was 0 75 57
another 0 75 57
case 0 75 57
of 0 75 57
a 0 75 57
“good” 0 75 57
prelate 0 75 57
being 0 75 57
got 0 75 57
rid 0 75 57
of. 0 75 57

And 0 75 58
it 0 75 58
seems 0 75 58
clear 0 75 58
from 0 75 58
the 0 75 58
way 0 75 58
it 0 75 58
was 0 75 58
done, 0 75 58
and 0 75 58
the 0 75 58
way 0 75 58
Francis 0 75 58
treated 0 75 58
Muller 0 75 58
in 0 75 58
general, 0 75 58
that 0 75 58
he 0 75 58
was 0 75 58
indeed 0 75 58
got 1 75 58
rid 1 75 58
of. 1 75 58

But 0 75 59
his 0 75 59
depiction 0 75 59
by 0 75 59
conservative 0 75 59
writers 0 75 59
as 0 75 59
a 0 75 59
beleaguered 0 75 59
champion 0 75 59
of 0 75 59
Catholic 0 75 59
orthodoxy 0 75 59
persecuted 0 75 59
by 0 75 59
the 0 75 59
regime 0 75 59
for 0 75 59
his 0 75 59
faithfulness 0 75 59
betrays 0 75 59
a 0 75 59
somewhat 0 75 59
selective 0 75 59
memory 0 75 59
and 0 75 59
short 0 75 59
attention 0 75 59
span. 0 75 59

Ed 0 75 60
Pentin 0 75 60
has 0 75 60
a 0 75 60
long 0 75 60
file 0 75 60
of 0 75 60
interviews 0 75 60
and 0 75 60
articles 0 75 60
about 0 75 60
Muller 0 75 60
that 0 75 60
clearly 0 75 60
show 0 75 60
his 0 75 60
complete 0 75 60
inability 0 75 60
to 0 75 60
make 0 75 60
up 0 75 60
his 0 75 60
mind 0 75 60
whose 0 75 60
side 0 75 60
he’s 0 75 60
on. 0 75 60

A 0 75 61
quick 0 75 61
examination 0 75 61
of 0 75 61
Muller’s 0 75 61
interviews 0 75 61
and 0 75 61
statements 0 75 61
reveal 0 75 61
an 0 75 61
irresolute 0 75 61
and 0 75 61
ultimately 0 75 61
calculating 0 75 61
mind 0 75 61
of 0 75 61
a 0 75 61
man 0 75 61
who 0 75 61
is 0 75 61
– 0 75 61
so 0 75 61
I 0 75 61
am 0 75 61
told 0 75 61
by 0 75 61
sources 0 75 61
close 0 75 61
to 0 75 61
him 0 75 61
– 0 75 61
motivated 0 75 61
mainly 0 75 61
by 0 75 61
a 0 75 61
puerile 0 75 61
desire 0 75 61
to 0 75 61
be 0 75 61
approved 0 75 61
of 0 75 61
by 0 75 61
the 1 75 61
“cool 1 75 61
kids” 1 75 61
in 1 75 61
the 1 75 61
Vatican, 1 75 61
on 0 75 61
the 0 75 61
one 0 75 61
hand, 0 75 61
and 0 75 61
an 0 75 61
unshakeable 0 75 61
conviction 0 75 61
of 0 75 61
his 0 75 61
own 0 75 61
theological 0 75 61
brilliance 0 75 61
on 0 75 61
the 0 75 61
other. 0 75 61

Most 0 75 62
recently, 0 75 62
on 0 75 62
October 0 75 62
30th, 0 75 62
Crux 0 75 62
quoted 0 75 62
him 0 75 62
under 0 75 62
the 0 75 62
headline, 0 75 62
“Cardinal 0 75 62
Muller 0 75 62
backs 0 75 62
Pope 0 75 62
Francis 0 75 62
against 0 75 62
critics 0 75 62
of 0 75 62
‘Amoris 0 75 62
Laetitia’” 0 75 62
in 0 75 62
which 0 75 62
the 0 75 62
former 0 75 62
head 0 75 62
of 0 75 62
the 0 75 62
CDF 0 75 62
has 0 75 62
at 0 75 62
last 0 75 62
climbed 0 75 62
on 0 75 62
board 0 75 62
the 0 75 62
Kasperian 0 75 62
train 0 75 62
on 0 75 62
reception 0 75 62
of 0 75 62
Communion 0 75 62
for 0 75 62
unrepentant 0 75 62
adulterers. 0 75 62

Signaling 1 75 63
furiously 1 75 63
with 0 75 63
the 0 75 63
trendy 0 75 63
FrancisChurch 0 75 63
buzzwords 0 75 63
and 0 75 63
even 0 75 63
trendier 0 75 63
blithering 1 75 63
incoherence, 1 75 63
Muller 0 75 63
writes 0 75 63
that 0 75 63
“mitigating 0 75 63
factors 0 75 63
in 0 75 63
guilt,” 0 75 63
can 0 75 63
lead, 0 75 63
couples 0 75 63
in 0 75 63
“an 0 75 63
uncertain 0 75 63
marital 0 75 63
situation” 0 75 63
through 0 75 63
a 0 75 63
“path 0 75 63
of 0 75 63
repentance” 0 75 63
– 0 75 63
always 0 75 63
“accompanied” 0 75 63
by 0 75 63
an 0 75 63
exquisitely 0 75 63
sensitive 0 75 63
confessor 0 75 63
– 0 75 63
to 0 75 63
a 0 75 63
point 0 75 63
where 0 75 63
the 0 75 63
reception 0 75 63
of 0 75 63
Communion 0 75 63
is 0 75 63
no 0 75 63
longer 0 75 63
sinful. 0 75 63

Presumably 1 75 64
because 1 75 64
adultery 1 75 64
itself 1 75 64
is 1 75 64
no 1 75 64
longer 1 75 64
sinful. 1 75 64

Or 0 75 65
sacrilege 0 75 65
either, 0 75 65
I 0 75 65
guess. 0 75 65

Or 0 75 66
something. 0 75 66

Somehow 0 75 67
the 0 75 67
“new 0 75 67
evangelization” 0 75 67
is 0 75 67
involved 0 75 67
in 0 75 67
this, 0 75 67
though 0 75 67
it’s 0 75 67
unclear 0 75 67
how 0 75 67
exactly 0 75 67
it 0 75 67
makes 0 75 67
adultery 0 75 67
and 0 75 67
sacrilege 0 75 67
OK. 0 75 67
Also, 0 75 67
it’s 0 75 67
very 0 75 67
important 0 75 67
to 0 75 67
fulfill 0 75 67
the 0 75 67
Sunday 0 75 67
Mass 0 75 67
obligation, 0 75 67
and 0 75 67
as 0 75 67
everyone 0 75 67
knows, 0 75 67
one 0 75 67
can’t 0 75 67
possibly 0 75 67
go 0 75 67
to 0 75 67
Mass 0 75 67
on 0 75 67
a 0 75 67
Sunday 0 75 67
without 0 75 67
receiving 0 75 67
Communion. 0 75 67

We 0 75 68
hear 0 75 68
again, 0 75 68
as 0 75 68
we 0 75 68
did 0 75 68
incessantly 0 75 68
from 0 75 68
the 0 75 68
Kasperians 0 75 68
at 0 75 68
the 0 75 68
Synods, 0 75 68
about 0 75 68
the 0 75 68
hard 0 75 68
case 0 75 68
of 0 75 68
the 1 75 68
poor, 1 75 68
poor 1 75 68
woman 1 75 68
who 0 75 68
has 0 75 68
been 0 75 68
abandoned 0 75 68
by 0 75 68
the 0 75 68
first 0 75 68
husband, 0 75 68
and 0 75 68
who 0 75 68
“finds 0 75 68
no 0 75 68
other 0 75 68
way 0 75 68
out 0 75 68
than 0 75 68
to 0 75 68
entrust 0 75 68
oneself 0 75 68
to 0 75 68
a 0 75 68
kind-hearted 0 75 68
person,” 0 75 68
… 0 75 68
with 1 75 68
whom, 1 75 68
I 1 75 68
guess, 1 75 68
she 1 75 68
has 1 75 68
also 1 75 68
no 1 75 68
choice 1 75 68
but 1 75 68
to 1 75 68
have 1 75 68
sexual 1 75 68
relations. 1 75 68

Because 1 75 69
of 1 75 69
kind-heartedness. 1 75 69

Anyway, 0 75 70
the 0 75 70
result 0 75 70
of 0 75 70
this 0 75 70
is 0 75 70
a 0 75 70
“marriage-like 0 75 70
relationship” 0 75 70
about 0 75 70
which 0 75 70
confessors 0 75 70
have 0 75 70
to 0 75 70
be 0 75 70
very 0 75 70
careful 0 75 70
not 0 75 70
to 0 75 70
say 0 75 70
mean 0 75 70
things. 0 75 70

Or 0 75 71
be 0 75 71
too 0 75 71
“extreme”. 0 75 71

It’s 0 75 72
very 0 75 72
important 0 75 72
for 0 75 72
him 0 75 72
to 0 75 72
avoid 0 75 72
a 0 75 72
“cheap 0 75 72
adaptation 0 75 72
to 0 75 72
the 0 75 72
relativistic 1 75 72
Zeitgeist,” 1 75 72
on 0 75 72
one 0 75 72
side, 0 75 72
and 0 75 72
a 0 75 72
“cold 0 75 72
application 0 75 72
of 0 75 72
the 0 75 72
dogmatic 0 75 72
commandments 0 75 72
and 0 75 72
the 0 75 72
canonical 0 75 72
rules,” 0 75 72
on 0 75 72
the 0 75 72
other. 0 75 72

Because 0 75 73
that 0 75 73
could 0 75 73
be 0 75 73
too 0 75 73
polarizing. 0 75 73

And 0 75 74
mean. 0 75 74

And 0 75 75
anyway, 0 75 75
sins 0 75 75
of 0 75 75
the 0 75 75
flesh 0 75 75
aren’t 0 75 75
the 0 75 75
worst 0 75 75
things 0 75 75
ever. 0 75 75

There 0 75 76
are, 0 75 76
like, 0 75 76
“different 0 75 76
levels” 0 75 76
of 0 75 76
gravity, 0 75 76
you 0 75 76
know? 0 75 76

And, 0 75 77
like, 0 75 77
it 0 75 77
depends 0 75 77
on 0 75 77
the 0 75 77
type 0 75 77
of 0 75 77
sin, 0 75 77
right? 0 75 77

“Spirit’s 0 75 78
sins” 0 75 78
like 0 75 78
spiritual 0 75 78
pride 0 75 78
and 0 75 78
avarice 0 75 78
and 0 75 78
stuff, 0 75 78
are 0 75 78
worse 0 75 78
than 0 75 78
“sins 0 75 78
of 0 75 78
the 0 75 78
flesh,” 0 75 78
you 0 75 78
know? 0 75 78

Which 0 75 79
are, 0 75 79
like, 0 75 79
only 0 75 79
a 0 75 79
result 0 75 79
of 0 75 79
“human 0 75 79
weakness,” 0 75 79
right? 0 75 79

Apparently 0 75 80
the 0 75 80
real 0 75 80
problem 0 75 80
with 0 75 80
this 0 75 80
whole 0 75 80
thing 0 75 80
has 0 75 80
been 0 75 80
that 0 75 80
the 0 75 80
Kasperian 0 75 80
kerfuffle 0 75 80
has 0 75 80
totally 0 75 80
been 0 75 80
blown 0 75 80
way, 0 75 80
way, 0 75 80
WAY 0 75 80
out 0 75 80
of 0 75 80
proportion, 0 75 80
and 0 75 80
the 0 75 80
“polarization” 0 75 80
it 0 75 80
has 0 75 80
caused 0 75 80
has 0 75 80
been 0 75 80
“regrettable”. 0 75 80

The 0 75 81
question 0 75 81
of 0 75 81
Communion 0 75 81
for 0 75 81
divorced 0 75 81
and 0 75 81
civilly 0 75 81
“remarried” 0 75 81
Catholics, 0 75 81
he 0 75 81
said, 0 75 81
has 0 75 81
been 0 75 81
“falsely 1 75 81
elevated 1 75 81
to 1 75 81
the 1 75 81
rank 1 75 81
of 1 75 81
a 1 75 81
decisive 1 75 81
question 1 75 81
of 1 75 81
Catholicism 1 75 81
and 1 75 81
a 1 75 81
measure 1 75 81
of 1 75 81
ideological 1 75 81
comparison 1 75 81
in 1 75 81
order 1 75 81
to 1 75 81
decide 1 75 81
whether 1 75 81
one 1 75 81
is 1 75 81
conservative 1 75 81
or 1 75 81
liberal, 1 75 81
in 1 75 81
favor 1 75 81
or 1 75 81
against 1 75 81
the 1 75 81
pope.” 1 75 81

For 0 75 82
years 0 75 82
under 0 75 82
Pope 0 75 82
Benedict, 0 75 82
Muller 0 75 82
was 0 75 82
engaged 0 75 82
in 0 75 82
an 0 75 82
open 0 75 82
war 0 75 82
with 0 75 82
the 0 75 82
German 0 75 82
episcopate 0 75 82
who 0 75 82
insisted 0 75 82
that 0 75 82
they 0 75 82
were 0 75 82
going 0 75 82
to 0 75 82
allow 0 75 82
Communion 0 75 82
for 0 75 82
the 0 75 82
divorced 0 75 82
and 0 75 82
remarried, 0 75 82
no 0 75 82
matter 0 75 82
what 0 75 82
Rome 0 75 82
said, 0 75 82
even 1 75 82
threatening 1 75 82
to 1 75 82
go 1 75 82
into 1 75 82
schism 1 75 82
if 1 75 82
they 1 75 82
didn’t 1 75 82
get 1 75 82
their 1 75 82
way[2]. 0 75 82

Muller, 0 75 83
with 0 75 83
little 0 75 83
backing 0 75 83
from 0 75 83
Pope 0 75 83
Benedict 0 75 83
– 0 75 83
who 0 75 83
appeared 0 75 83
content 0 75 83
to 0 75 83
allow 0 75 83
his 0 75 83
CDF 0 75 83
prefect 0 75 83
and 0 75 83
the 0 75 83
Germans 0 75 83
shout 0 75 83
out 0 75 83
their 0 75 83
differences 0 75 83
– 0 75 83
and 0 75 83
with 0 75 83
outright 0 75 83
opposition 0 75 83
from 0 75 83
Francis, 0 75 83
did 0 75 83
indeed 0 75 83
strive 0 75 83
to 0 75 83
hold 0 75 83
the 0 75 83
line. 0 75 83

The 0 75 84
fact 0 75 84
that 0 75 84
Francis 0 75 84
orchestrated 0 75 84
the 0 75 84
Synods 0 75 84
to 0 75 84
undermine 0 75 84
him 0 75 84
was 0 75 84
certainly 0 75 84
not 0 75 84
his 0 75 84
fault. 0 75 84

And 0 75 85
it 0 75 85
is 0 75 85
difficult 0 75 85
to 0 75 85
imagine 0 75 85
anyone 0 75 85
being 0 75 85
in 0 75 85
a 0 75 85
worse 0 75 85
position 0 75 85
than 0 75 85
he 0 75 85
was 0 75 85
at 0 75 85
the 0 75 85
time. 0 75 85

But 0 75 86
since 0 75 86
then, 0 75 86
Muller 0 75 86
has 0 75 86
demonstrated 0 75 86
very 0 75 86
little 0 75 86
of 0 75 86
his 0 75 86
former 0 75 86
grit, 0 75 86
instead 0 75 86
attempting 0 75 86
from 0 75 86
one 0 75 86
day 0 75 86
to 0 75 86
the 0 75 86
next 0 75 86
to 0 75 86
appease 0 75 86
both 0 75 86
sides. 0 75 86

Reportedly 0 75 87
removed 0 75 87
from 0 75 87
CDF 0 75 87
– 0 75 87
and 0 75 87
of 0 75 87
course 0 75 87
lionized 1 75 87
by 0 75 87
“conservatives” 0 75 87
– 0 75 87
for 0 75 87
his 0 75 87
mild 0 75 87
and 0 75 87
equivocating 0 75 87
opposition 0 75 87
to 0 75 87
Amoris 0 75 87
Laetitia, 0 75 87
Muller 0 75 87
has 0 75 87
gone 0 75 87
back 0 75 87
and 0 75 87
forth 0 75 87
in 0 75 87
what 0 75 87
can 0 75 87
easily 0 75 87
be 0 75 87
seen 0 75 87
as 0 75 87
a 0 75 87
desperate 0 75 87
attempt 0 75 87
to 0 75 87
find 0 75 87
friends 0 75 87
in 0 75 87
both 0 75 87
camps. 0 75 87

With 0 75 88
this 0 75 88
in 0 75 88
mind 0 75 88
one 0 75 88
could 0 75 88
be 0 75 88
forgiven 0 75 88
for 0 75 88
not 0 75 88
taking 0 75 88
his 0 75 88
October 0 75 88
30th 0 75 88
essay 0 75 88
too 0 75 88
seriously. 0 75 88

Perhaps 0 75 89
one 0 75 89
of 0 75 89
the 0 75 89
good 0 75 89
effects 0 75 89
to 0 75 89
come 0 75 89
from 0 75 89
Fr. 0 75 89

Weinandy’s 0 75 90
persecution 0 75 90
will 0 75 90
be 0 75 90
to 0 75 90
demonstrate 0 75 90
how 0 75 90
a 0 75 90
pastor 0 75 90
of 0 75 90
the 0 75 90
Catholic 0 75 90
Church 0 75 90
is 0 75 90
supposed 0 75 90
to 0 75 90
act. 0 75 90

As 0 75 91
my 0 75 91
friend 0 75 91
said, 0 75 91
maybe 0 75 91
“it’s 0 75 91
going 0 75 91
to 0 75 91
become 0 75 91
harder 0 75 91
and 0 75 91
harder 0 75 91
for 0 75 91
men 0 75 91
of 0 75 91
conscience 0 75 91
and 0 75 91
position 0 75 91
to 0 75 91
sit 0 75 91
on 0 75 91
the 0 75 91
fence,” 0 75 91
assuming 0 75 91
there 0 75 91

[1] 0 75 94
In 0 75 94
this 0 75 94
interview, 0 75 94
Fr. 0 75 94

Weinandy 0 75 95
gave 0 75 95
a 0 75 95
remarkable 0 75 95
story 0 75 95
of 0 75 95
how 0 75 95
his 0 75 95
prayer 0 75 95
for 0 75 95
a 0 75 95
“sign” 0 75 95
that 0 75 95
he 0 75 95
ought 0 75 95
to 0 75 95
write 0 75 95
the 0 75 95
letter 0 75 95
was 0 75 95
very 0 75 95
specifically 0 75 95
answered: 0 75 95
“If 0 75 95
you 0 75 95
want 0 75 95
me 0 75 95
to 0 75 95
write 0 75 95
something, 0 75 95
you 0 75 95
have 0 75 95
to 0 75 95
give 0 75 95
me 0 75 95
a 0 75 95
clear 0 75 95
sign,” 0 75 95
Weinandy 0 75 95
recalls 0 75 95
saying. 0 75 95

“Tomorrow 0 75 96
morning, 0 75 96
I’m 0 75 96
going 0 75 96
to 0 75 96
Saint 0 75 96
Mary 0 75 96
Major’s 0 75 96
to 0 75 96
pray, 0 75 96
and 0 75 96
then 0 75 96
I 0 75 96
am 0 75 96
going 0 75 96
to 0 75 96
Saint 0 75 96
John 0 75 96
Lateran. 0 75 96

After 0 75 97
that, 0 75 97
I’m 0 75 97
coming 0 75 97
back 0 75 97
to 0 75 97
Saint 0 75 97
Peter’s 0 75 97
to 0 75 97
have 0 75 97
lunch 0 75 97
with 0 75 97
a 0 75 97
seminary 0 75 97
friend 0 75 97
of 0 75 97
mine.” 0 75 97
“During 0 75 97
that 0 75 97
interval, 0 75 97
I 0 75 97
must 0 75 97
meet 0 75 97
someone 0 75 97
that 0 75 97
I 0 75 97
know 0 75 97
but 0 75 97
have 0 75 97
not 0 75 97
seen 0 75 97
in 0 75 97
a 0 75 97
very 0 75 97
long 0 75 97
time, 0 75 97
and 0 75 97
would 0 75 97
never 0 75 97
expect 0 75 97
to 0 75 97
see 0 75 97
in 0 75 97
Rome 0 75 97
at 0 75 97
this 0 75 97
time. 0 75 97

That 0 75 98
person 0 75 98
cannot 0 75 98
be 0 75 98
from 0 75 98
the 0 75 98
United 0 75 98
States, 0 75 98
Canada 0 75 98
or 0 75 98
Great 0 75 98
Britain. 0 75 98

Moreover, 0 75 99
that 0 75 99
person 0 75 99
has 0 75 99
to 0 75 99
say 0 75 99
to 0 75 99
me, 0 75 99
‘Keep 0 75 99
up 0 75 99
the 0 75 99
good 0 75 99
writing’.” 0 75 99
Weinandy 0 75 99
said, 0 75 99
exactly 0 75 99
that 0 75 99
happened 0 75 99
the 0 75 99
next 0 75 99
day, 0 75 99
in 0 75 99
a 0 75 99
chance 0 75 99
meeting 0 75 99
with 0 75 99
an 0 75 99
archbishop 0 75 99
he’d 0 75 99
known 0 75 99
a 0 75 99
long 0 75 99
time 0 75 99
ago 0 75 99
but 0 75 99
not 0 75 99
seen 0 75 99
for 0 75 99
over 0 75 99
twenty 0 75 99
years, 0 75 99
who 0 75 99
congratulated 0 75 99
him 0 75 99
for 0 75 99
a 0 75 99
book 0 75 99
on 0 75 99
the 0 75 99
Incarnation 0 75 99
and 0 75 99
then 0 75 99
said 0 75 99
the 0 75 99
right 0 75 99
words, 0 75 99
“Keep 0 75 99
up 0 75 99
the 0 75 99
good 0 75 99
writing.” 0 75 99
“There 0 75 99
was 0 75 99
no 0 75 99
longer 0 75 99
any 0 75 99
doubt 0 75 99
in 0 75 99
my 0 75 99
mind 0 75 99
that 0 75 99
Jesus 0 75 99
wanted 0 75 99
me 0 75 99
to 0 75 99
write 0 75 99
something,” 0 75 99
Weinandy 0 75 99
said. 0 75 99

[2] 0 75 100
It’s 0 75 100
notable 0 75 100
that 0 75 100
these 0 75 100
howling 1 75 100
tantrums 1 75 100
from 0 75 100
the 0 75 100
German 0 75 100
bishops 0 75 100
halted 0 75 100
abruptly 0 75 100
about 0 75 100
the 0 75 100
same 0 75 100
time 0 75 100
as 0 75 100
Cardinal 0 75 100
Kasper 0 75 100
gave 0 75 100
his 0 75 100
infamous 0 75 100
consistory 0 75 100
speech 0 75 100
in 0 75 100
February 0 75 100
2014. 0 75 100
