head 0
of 0
the 0
Nation 0
of 0
Islam, 0
has 0
been 0
back 0
in 0
the 0
headlines 0
after 0
a 0
previously 0
unreleased 0
photo 0
of 0
him 0
with 0
President 0
Barack 0
Obama 0
was 0
published 0
in 0
January 0
and 0
Mr. 0
Farrakhan 0
gave 0
an 0
anti-Semitic 0
speech 0
at 0
his 0
organization’s 0
annual 0
convention 0
last 0
month. 0

The 0

Feb. 0
25 0
speech, 0
which 0
was 0
given 0
at 0
an 0
event 0
for 0
Saviour’s 0
Day, 0
a 0
religious 0
gathering 0
of 0
the 0
Nation, 0
ran 0
for 0
almost 0
three 0
hours. 0

During 0
it, 0
Mr. 0
Farrakhan 0
said 0
that 0
the 0
“powerful 0
Jews” 0
were 0
his 0
enemies, 0
and 0
that 0
Jews 1
were 1
“responsible 1
for 1
all 1
of 1
this 1
filth 1
and 1
degenerate 1
behavior 1
that 1
Hollywood 1
is 1
putting 1
out 1
turning 1
men 1
into 1
women 1
and 1
women 1
into 1
men,” 1
as 0
well 0
as 0
other 0
incendiary 0
remarks. 0

A 0

religious 0
fundamentalist 0
whose 0
group 0
has 0
been 0
condemned 0
by 0
the 0
Southern 0
Poverty 0
Law 0
Center, 0
Mr. 0
Farrakhan 0
is 0
fervently 1
opposed 0
to 0
the 0
legitimacy 0
of 0
the 0
state 0
of 0
Israel, 0
and 0
his 0
political 0
positions 0
regarding 0
the 0
country 0
frequently 0
spill 0
over 0
into 0
bigoted 0
remarks 0
about 0
Jews, 0
which 0
is 0
why 0
many 0
public 0
officials 0
have 0
avoided 0
association 0
with 0
him. 0

Mr. 0
Farrakhan 0
has 0
denied 0
that 0
he 0
is 0
anti-Semitic 0
and 0
has 0
even 0
said 0
that 0
his 0
father 0
may 0
have 0
been 0
Jewish. 0

Much 0

of 0
the 0
recent 0
coverage 0
has 0
been 0
focused 0
on 0
Tamika 0
Mallory, 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
heads 0
of 0
the 0
Women’s 0
March 0
organization, 0
who 0
attended 0
the 0
Feb. 0
25 0
speech, 0
and 0
on 0
Representative 0
Danny 0
Davis, 0
a 0
Democrat 0
of 0
Illinois, 0
who 0
defended 0
Mr. 0
Obama 0
and 0
Mr. 0
Farrakhan 0
after 0
the 0
photo 0
came 0
to 0
light. 0

Their 0
reluctance 0
to 0
condemn 1
Mr. 0
Farrakhan 0
has 0
led 0
to 0
criticism 0
from 0
across 0
the 0
ideological 0
spectrum 0
this 0
week. 0

What 0

is 0
the 0
Nation 0
of 0
Islam? 0

The 0
Nation 0
of 0
Islam 0
is 0
a 0
political 0
and 0
religious 0
movement 0
that 0
was 0
started 0
by 0
W.D. 0

Fard 0
Muhammad 0
in 0
1931 0
and 0
continued 0
by 0
Elijah 0
Muhammad 0
in 0
1933. 0

It 0
first 0
became 0
prominent 0
after 0
a 0
man 0
named 0
Malcolm 0
Little 0
joined 0
the 0
organization. 0

Encouraged 0
by 0
Elijah 0
Muhammad, 0
he 0
changed 0
his 0
last 0
name 0
to 0
X 0
and 0
became 0
a 0
minister 0
in 0
the 0
movement. 0

Edward 1

E. 1
Curtis 1
IV, 1
the 1
author 1
of 1
“Black 1
Muslim 1
Religion 1
in 1
the 1
Nation 1
of 1
Islam,” 1
said 1
that 1
while 1
estimates 1
ranged 1
wildly 1
about 1
how 1
many 1
bona 1
fide 1
members 1
belonged 1
to 1
the 1
Nation, 1
he 1
believes 1
that 1
there 1
were 1
tens 1
of 1
thousands 1
of 1
members 1
in 1
the 1
1960s 1
and 1
early 1
1970s. 1

But 1
he 1
said 1
that 1
millions 1
of 1
others 1
sympathized 1
with 1
the 1
movement’s 1
anticolonial 1
stance 1
and 1
were 1
inspired 1
by 1
its 1
most 1
famous 1
member, 1
Muhammad 1
Ali. 1

Who 0

is 0
Louis 0
Farrakhan? 0

Born 0
Louis 0
Eugene 0
Walcott 0
in 0
New 0
York 0
in 0
1933, 0
Mr. 0
Farrakhan 0
joined 0
the 0
Nation 0
of 0
Islam 0
in 0
the 0
mid-1950s 0
and 0
rose 0
quickly 0
within 0
the 0
organization, 0
becoming 0
close 0
to 0
Malcolm 0
X. 0

After 0
the 0
assassination 0
of 0
Malcolm 0
X 0
in 0
1965, 0
he 0
became 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
most 0
powerful 0
members 0
of 0
the 0
Nation 0
and 0
its 0
chief 0
spokesman, 0
the 0
position 0
that 0
Malcolm 0
X 0
had 0
held. 0

The 0

Nation 0
of 0
Islam 0
had 0
gained 0
followers 0
around 0
the 0
nation 0
in 0
the 0
1940s 0
and 0
’50s 0
by 0
providing 0
something 0
of 0
a 0
religious 0
answer 0
to 0
antiblack 0
racism. 0

It 0
was 0
not 0
widely 0
recognized 0
as 0
an 0
anti-Jewish 0
organization 0
during 0
its 0
early 0
years 0
(its 0
early 0
literature, 0
though, 0
focused 0
on 0
“the 1
white 1
man” 1
as 1
“the 1
white 1
devil”). 1

But 0
in 0
1967, 0
it 0
became 0
outspokenly 1
and 1
flagrantly 1
anti-Zionist, 1
in 0
an 0
expression 0
of 0
solidarity 0
with 0
Palestinians. 0

That 0
political 0
position 0
became 0
a 0
vehicle 0
for 0
Mr. 0
Farrakhan 0
to 0
express 0
his 0
anti-Semitism. 0

(Among 0
his 0
more 0
infamous 0
comments 0
is 0
his 1
1984 1
description 1
of 1
Adolf 1
Hitler 1
as 1
“a 1
very 1
great 1
man.”) 1

In 0

1975, 0
when 0
Elijah 0
Muhammad 0
died, 0
the 0
Nation 0
split 0
into 0
two 0
factions. 0

The 0
faction 0
reconstituted 0
under 0
Mr. 0
Farrakhan 0
in 0
the 0
late 0
1970s 0
retained 0
the 0
original 0
name, 0
though 0
not 0
the 0
influence 0
or 0
support 0
that 0
it 0
had 0
when 0
its 0
leaders 0
were 0
Malcolm 0
X, 0
Muhammad 0
Ali 0
and 0
Elijah 0
Muhammad. 0

Mr. 0
Curtis 0
said 0
that 0
today 0
the 0
membership 0
could 0
be 0
in 0
the 0
thousands, 0
and 0
there 0
could 0
even 0
be 0
as 0
many 0
as 0
10,000 0
followers. 0

Mr. 0
Farrakhan, 0
whose 0
name, 0
the 0
Anti-Defamation 0
League 0
wrote 0
after 0
the 0
February 0
event, 0
is 0
“virtually 0
synonymous 0
with 0
anti-Semitism,” 0
then 0
drew 0
national 0
attention 0
in 0
1984, 0
when 0
he 0
exhorted 0
his 0
followers 0
to 0
support 0
Jesse 0
Jackson’s 0
bid 0
for 0
the 0
Democratic 0
presidential 0
nomination. 0

In 0

a 0
radio 0
address, 0
he 0
urged 0
listeners 0
to 0
“make 0
an 0
example” 0
of 0
a 0
Washington 0
Post 0
reporter 0
who 0
had 0
reported 0
that 0
Mr. 0
Jackson 0
had 0
used 0
anti-Semitic 0
terms 0
in 0
private. 0

Mr. 0
Jackson 0
repudiated 0
Mr. 0
Farrakhan, 0
but 0
the 0
minister’s 0
support 0
proved 0
troublesome 0
to 0
his 0
1988 0
campaign 0
as 0
well. 0

He 0

was 0
back 0
in 0
the 0
news 0
in 0
1995 0
when 0
he 0
organized 0
what 0
became 0
known 0
as 0
the 0
“Million 0
Man 0
March,” 0
a 0
political 0
and 0
religious 0
revival 0
event 0
in 0
Washington. 0

Why 1

were 1
Tamika 1
Mallory 1
and 1
Danny 1
Davis 1
reluctant 1
to 1
denounce 1
him? 1

Ms. 0
Mallory, 0
who 0
declined 0
to 0
comment 0
for 0
this 0
article, 0
did 0
not 0
respond 0
to 0
calls 0
to 1
condemn 1
Mr. 0
Farrakhan, 0
for 0
whom 0
she 0
had 0
expressed 0
admiration 0
in 0
the 0
past. 0

On 0

March 0
3, 0
she 0
said 0
on 0
Twitter 0
that 0
someone 0
had 0
brought 0
to 0
her 0
attention 0
that 0
she 0
had 0
yet 0
to 0
tweet 0
“my 0
absolute 0
position 0
on 0
how 0
wrong 0
anti-Semitism 0
is.” 0
A 0
day 0
later, 0
she 0
said 0
that 0
she 0
was 0
“committed 0
to 0
ending 0
anti-black 0
racism, 0
anti-Semitism, 0
homophobia 0
& 0
transphobia,” 0
but 0
did 0
not 0
mention 0
Mr. 0
Farrakhan. 0

In 0

an 0
essay 0
posted 0
Wednesday, 0
she 0
said 0
that 0
she 0
had 0
been 0
attending 0
Saviour’s 0
Day 0
celebrations 0
for 0
over 0
30 0
years. 0

“In 0

that 0
most 0
difficult 0
period 0
of 0
my 0
life, 0
it 0
was 0
the 0
women 0
of 0
the 0
Nation 0
of 0
Islam 0
who 0
supported 0
me 0
and 0
I 0
have 0
always 0
held 0
them 0
close 0
to 0
my 0
heart 0
for 0
that 0
reason,” 0
she 0
said. 0

The 0
essay 0
did 0
not 0
mention 0
Mr. 0
Farrakhan. 0

Asked 0
what 0
the 0
appeal 0
of 0
Mr. 0
Farrakhan’s 0
views 0
might 0
be 0
to 0
people 0
like 0
Ms. 0
Mallory, 0
religious 0
scholars 0
emphasized 0
that 0
the 0
Nation 0
of 0
Islam 0
is 0
a 0
religion 0
and 0
can 0
provide 0
comfort 0
and 0
aid 0
to 0
its 0
adherents. 0

“For 0

those 0
who 0
find 0
it 0
appealing, 0
it 0
is 0
a 0
form 0
of 0
radical 0
black 0
self 0
love 0
that 0
is 0
willing 0
to 0
challenge 0
any 0
potential 0
impediment 0
to 0
black 0
freedom,” 0
Mr. 0
Curtis 0
said. 0

Yvonne 0

Chireau, 0
a 0
professor 0
of 0
religion 0
at 0
Swarthmore 0
who 0
called 0
Mr. 0
Farrakhan’s 0
remarks 0
about 0
Jews 0
“unbelievably 0
vile,” 0
emphasized 0
that 0
his 0
fundamentalism 0
was 0
comparable 0
to 0
the 0
fundamentalist 0
views 0
found 0
in 0
other 0

Coincidentally, 0

the 0
photo 0
of 0
Mr. 0
Farrakhan 0
and 0
Mr. 0
Obama 0
had 0
been 0
published 0
by 0
the 0
Trice 0
Edney 0
News 0
Wire 0
in 0
January. 0

The 0
News 0
Wire 0
reported 0
that 0
the 0
picture 0
had 0
been 0
taken 0
by 0
the 0
photojournalist 0
Askia 0
Muhammad 0
during 0
a 0
2005 0
meeting 0
of 0
the 0
Congressional 0
Black 0
Caucus 0
and 0
that 0
Mr. 0
Muhammad 0
kept 0
the 0
photo 0
under 0
wraps 0
so 0
as 0
not 0
to 0
hurt 0
Mr. 0
Obama’s 0
candidacy. 0

(Mr. 0

Muhammad, 0
in 0
a 0
2012 0
blog 0
post, 0
said 0
that 0
he 0
was 0
an 0
admirer 0
of 0
Mr. 0
Farrakhan 0
and 0
that 0
the 0
minister 0
was 0
not 0
an 0
anti-Semite. 0

He 0
reaffirmed 0
that 0
he 0
admired 0
Mr. 0
Farrakhan 0
in 0
an 0
interview 0
on 0
Friday, 0
though 0
he 0
said 0
that 0
the 0
things 0
the 0
minister 0
says 0
about 0
Jewish 0
people 0
“sometimes 0
make 1
me 1
shudder.”) 1

Katie 0

Hill, 0
a 0
spokeswoman 0
for 0
Mr. 0
Obama, 0
said 0
on 0
Friday: 0
“President 0
Obama 0
has 0
denounced 0
racism 0
and 0
anti-Semitism 0
his 0
entire 0
life. 0

That 0
includes 0
his 0
public 0
and 0
repeated 0
repudiations 0
of 0
Louis 0
Farrakhan’s 0
views 0
over 0
the 0
years. 0

Today 0
is 0
no 0
different 0
— 0
he 0
still 0
rejects 0
the 0
harmful 1
and 1
divisive 1
views 1
Farrakhan 0
continues 0
to 0
espouse.” 0

Representative 0

Davis, 0
who 0
was 0
interviewed 0
by 0
The 0
Daily 0
Caller, 0
a 0
conservative 0
news 0
site, 0
after 0
the 0
photo 0
emerged, 0
called 0
Mr. 0
Farrakhan 0
an 1
“outstanding 1
human 1
being,” 1
and 0
later 0
said 0
he 0
was 0
not 0
bothered 0
by 0
the 0
leader’s 0
position 0
on 0
“The 0
Jewish 0
Question.” 0

After 0

a 0
monthlong 1
backlash 1
about 0
that 0
interview, 0
largely 0
in 0
conservative 0
media, 0
Mr. 0
Davis 0
said 0
in 0
a 0
statement 0
to 0
Forward 0
on 0
Thursday 0
that 0
“I 0
reject, 0
