During 0 14 3
it, 0 14 3
Mr. 0 14 3
Farrakhan 0 14 3
said 0 14 3
that 0 14 3
the 0 14 3
“powerful 0 14 3
Jews” 0 14 3
were 0 14 3
his 0 14 3
enemies, 0 14 3
and 0 14 3
that 0 14 3
Jews 1 14 3
were 1 14 3
“responsible 1 14 3
for 1 14 3
all 1 14 3
of 1 14 3
this 1 14 3

that 1 14 3

Mr. 0 14 4

is 0 14 4
fervently 1 14 4
opposed 0 14 4
to 0 14 4
the 0 14 4
legitimacy 0 14 4
of 0 14 4
the 0 14 4

over 0 14 4

bigoted 0 14 4
remarks 0 14 4
about 0 14 4
Jews, 0 14 4
which 0 14 4
is 0 14 4
why 0 14 4
many 0 14 4

Mr. 0 14 5
Farrakhan 0 14 5
has 0 14 5
denied 0 14 5
that 0 14 5
he 0 14 5
is 0 14 5
anti-Semitic 0 14 5
and 0 14 5
has 0 14 5
even 0 14 5

Their 0 14 7

to 0 14 7

Mr. 0 14 7

It 0 14 11
first 0 14 11

after 0 14 11
a 0 14 11

“Black 1 14 13

the 1 14 13

of 1 14 13
Islam,” 1 14 13
said 1 14 13
that 1 14 13
while 1 14 13
estimates 1 14 13
ranged 1 14 13
wildly 1 14 13
about 1 14 13
how 1 14 13
many 1 14 13
bona 1 14 13

belonged 1 14 13
to 1 14 13
the 1 14 13
Nation, 1 14 13
he 1 14 13
believes 1 14 13
that 1 14 13
there 1 14 13
were 1 14 13
tens 1 14 13

early 1 14 13
1970s. 1 14 13

But 1 14 14
he 1 14 14
said 1 14 14
that 1 14 14
millions 1 14 14

with 1 14 14

in 0 14 16
the 0 14 16
mid-1950s 0 14 16
and 0 14 16
rose 0 14 16
quickly 0 14 16
within 0 14 16
the 0 14 16

becoming 0 14 16
close 0 14 16
to 0 14 16

After 0 14 17
the 0 14 17

of 0 14 17
Malcolm 0 14 17
X 0 14 17
in 0 14 17
1965, 0 14 17
he 0 14 17

Nation 0 14 17
and 0 14 17
its 0 14 17
chief 0 14 17
spokesman, 0 14 17
the 0 14 17
position 0 14 17
that 0 14 17
Malcolm 0 14 17

had 0 14 17

held. 0 14 18
The 0 14 18

in 0 14 18
the 0 14 18
1940s 0 14 18
and 0 14 18
’50s 0 14 18
by 0 14 18
providing 0 14 18
something 0 14 18
of 0 14 18
a 0 14 18
religious 0 14 18
answer 0 14 18
to 0 14 18
antiblack 0 14 18

racism. 0 14 19
It 0 14 19
was 0 14 19
not 0 14 19
widely 0 14 19
recognized 0 14 19
as 0 14 19
an 0 14 19
anti-Jewish 0 14 19
organization 0 14 19
during 0 14 19
its 0 14 19
early 0 14 19
years 0 14 19
(its 0 14 19
early 0 14 19
literature, 0 14 19
though, 0 14 19
focused 0 14 19
on 0 14 19
“the 1 14 19
white 1 14 19
man” 1 14 19
as 1 14 19
“the 1 14 19
white 1 14 19
devil”). 1 14 19

But 0 14 20
in 0 14 20
1967, 0 14 20
it 0 14 20
became 0 14 20
outspokenly 1 14 20
and 1 14 20
flagrantly 1 14 20
anti-Zionist, 1 14 20
in 0 14 20
an 0 14 20
expression 0 14 20
of 0 14 20
solidarity 0 14 20
with 0 14 20
Palestinians. 0 14 20

That 0 14 21
political 0 14 21
position 0 14 21
became 0 14 21
a 0 14 21
vehicle 0 14 21
for 0 14 21
Mr. 0 14 21
Farrakhan 0 14 21
to 0 14 21
express 0 14 21
his 0 14 21
anti-Semitism. 0 14 21

(Among 0 14 22
his 0 14 22
more 0 14 22
infamous 0 14 22
comments 0 14 22
is 0 14 22
his 1 14 22
1984 1 14 22
description 1 14 22
of 1 14 22
Adolf 1 14 22
Hitler 1 14 22
as 1 14 22
“a 1 14 22
very 1 14 22
great 1 14 22

man.”) 1 14 23
In 0 14 23
1975, 0 14 23
when 0 14 23
Elijah 0 14 23
Muhammad 0 14 23
died, 0 14 23
the 0 14 23
Nation 0 14 23
split 0 14 23
into 0 14 23
two 0 14 23
factions. 0 14 23

The 0 14 24
faction 0 14 24
reconstituted 0 14 24
under 0 14 24
Mr. 0 14 24
Farrakhan 0 14 24
in 0 14 24
the 0 14 24
late 0 14 24
1970s 0 14 24
retained 0 14 24
the 0 14 24
original 0 14 24
name, 0 14 24
though 0 14 24
not 0 14 24
the 0 14 24
influence 0 14 24
or 0 14 24
support 0 14 24
that 0 14 24
it 0 14 24
had 0 14 24
when 0 14 24
its 0 14 24
leaders 0 14 24
were 0 14 24
Malcolm 0 14 24

and 0 14 24
Elijah 0 14 24
Muhammad. 0 14 24

Mr. 0 14 25
Curtis 0 14 25
said 0 14 25
that 0 14 25
today 0 14 25
the 0 14 25
membership 0 14 25
could 0 14 25
be 0 14 25
in 0 14 25
the 0 14 25
thousands, 0 14 25
and 0 14 25
there 0 14 25
could 0 14 25
even 0 14 25
be 0 14 25
as 0 14 25
many 0 14 25
as 0 14 25
10,000 0 14 25
followers. 0 14 25

Mr. 0 14 26
Farrakhan, 0 14 26
whose 0 14 26
name, 0 14 26
the 0 14 26
Anti-Defamation 0 14 26
League 0 14 26
wrote 0 14 26
after 0 14 26
the 0 14 26
February 0 14 26
event, 0 14 26
is 0 14 26
“virtually 0 14 26
synonymous 0 14 26
with 0 14 26
anti-Semitism,” 0 14 26
then 0 14 26
drew 0 14 26
national 0 14 26
attention 0 14 26
in 0 14 26
1984, 0 14 26
when 0 14 26
he 0 14 26
exhorted 0 14 26
his 0 14 26
followers 0 14 26
to 0 14 26

for 0 14 26

nomination. 0 14 26

In 0 14 27
a 0 14 27
radio 0 14 27
address, 0 14 27
he 0 14 27
urged 0 14 27
listeners 0 14 27
to 0 14 27
“make 0 14 27
an 0 14 27
example” 0 14 27
of 0 14 27
a 0 14 27
Washington 0 14 27
Post 0 14 27
reporter 0 14 27
who 0 14 27
had 0 14 27
reported 0 14 27
that 0 14 27
Mr. 0 14 27
Jackson 0 14 27
had 0 14 27
used 0 14 27
anti-Semitic 0 14 27
terms 0 14 27
in 0 14 27

private. 0 14 28
Mr. 0 14 28
Jackson 0 14 28
repudiated 0 14 28
Mr. 0 14 28
Farrakhan, 0 14 28
but 0 14 28
the 0 14 28
minister’s 0 14 28
support 0 14 28
proved 0 14 28
troublesome 0 14 28
to 0 14 28
his 0 14 28
1988 0 14 28
campaign 0 14 28

as 0 14 29
