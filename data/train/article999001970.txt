Patel, 0 444 6
32, 0 444 6
was 0 444 6
the 0 444 6
first 0 444 6
Indian-American 0 444 6

for 0 444 6
Outstanding 0 444 6

Patel 0 444 7
has 0 444 7
previously 0 444 7
performed 0 444 7
on 0 444 7
Late 0 444 7

such 0 444 7

During 0 444 8
the 0 444 8
event, 0 444 8
Patel’s 0 444 8
performance 0 444 8
featured 0 444 8
commentary 0 444 8
on 0 444 8
his 0 444 8
experience 0 444 8
living 0 444 8
in 0 444 8
a 0 444 8
diverse 0 444 8
area 0 444 8
of 0 444 8
New 0 444 8
York 0 444 8
City—including 0 444 8
a 0 444 8
joke 0 444 8
about 0 444 8
a 0 444 8
gay, 0 444 8
black 0 444 8
man 0 444 8
in 0 444 8
his 0 444 8
neighborhood—which 0 444 8
AAA 0 444 8
officials 0 444 8
deemed 0 444 8
inappropriate. 0 444 8

Patel 0 444 9
joked 0 444 9
that 0 444 9
being 0 444 9
gay 0 444 9
cannot 0 444 9
be 0 444 9
a 0 444 9
choice 0 444 9
because 0 444 9
“no 1 444 9
one 1 444 9
looks 1 444 9
in 1 444 9
the 1 444 9
mirror 1 444 9
and 1 444 9
thinks, 1 444 9
‘this 1 444 9
black 1 444 9
thing 1 444 9
is 1 444 9
too 1 444 9
easy, 1 444 9
let 1 444 9
me 1 444 9
just 1 444 9
add 1 444 9
another 1 444 9
thing 1 444 9
to 1 444 9
it.’” 0 444 9

That's 0 444 10
what 0 444 10
Columbia 1 444 10
snowflakes 1 444 10
thought 0 444 10
was 0 444 10
offensive. 0 444 10

I 0 444 11
can't 0 444 11
imagine 0 444 11
what 0 444 11
they 0 444 11
would 0 444 11
have 0 444 11
made 0 444 11
of 0 444 11
Richard 0 444 11
Pryor, 0 444 11
or 0 444 11
at 0 444 11
this 0 444 11
point 0 444 11
even, 0 444 11
Chris 0 444 11
Rock. 0 444 11

It's 0 444 12
also 0 444 12
a 0 444 12
version 0 444 12
of 0 444 12
a 0 444 12
Sammy 0 444 12
Davis 0 444 12
Jr 0 444 12
joke 0 444 12
about 0 444 12
converting 0 444 12
to 0 444 12
Judaism. 0 444 12

Which 0 444 13
is 0 444 13
now 0 444 13
a 0 444 13
hate 0 444 13
crime. 0 444 13

About 0 444 14
30 0 444 14
minutes 0 444 14
into 0 444 14
Patel’s 0 444 14
set, 0 444 14
members 0 444 14
of 0 444 14
AAA 0 444 14
interrupted 0 444 14
the 0 444 14
performance, 0 444 14
denounced 0 444 14
his 0 444 14
jokes 0 444 14
about 0 444 14
racial 0 444 14
identities 0 444 14
and 0 444 14
sexual 0 444 14
orientation, 0 444 14
and 0 444 14
provided 0 444 14
him 0 444 14
with 0 444 14
a 0 444 14
few 0 444 14
moments 0 444 14
for 0 444 14
closing 0 444 14
remarks. 0 444 14

Comrades, 1 444 15
these 1 444 15
jokes 1 444 15
you 1 444 15
have 1 444 15
been 1 444 15
listening 1 444 15
to 1 444 15
are 1 444 15
thought 1 444 15
crimes! 1 444 15

Patel 0 444 16
pushed 0 444 16
back 0 444 16
on 0 444 16
the 0 444 16
officials’ 0 444 16
remarks, 0 444 16
and 0 444 16
said 0 444 16
that 0 444 16
while 0 444 16
he 0 444 16
stood 0 444 16
in 0 444 16
solidarity 0 444 16
with 0 444 16
Asian 0 444 16
American 0 444 16
identities, 0 444 16
none 0 444 16
of 0 444 16
his 0 444 16
remarks 0 444 16
were 0 444 16
offensive, 0 444 16
and 0 444 16
he 0 444 16
was 0 444 16
exposing 0 444 16
the 0 444 16
audience 0 444 16
to 0 444 16
ideas 0 444 16
that 0 444 16
would 0 444 16
be 0 444 16
found 0 444 16
“in 0 444 16
the 0 444 16
real 0 444 16
world.” 0 444 16
Before 0 444 16
he 0 444 16
could 0 444 16
finish, 0 444 16
Patel’s 0 444 16
microphone 0 444 16
was 0 444 16
cut 0 444 16
from 0 444 16
off-stage, 0 444 16
and 0 444 16
he 0 444 16
proceeded 0 444 16
to 0 444 16
leave. 0 444 16

The 0 444 17
real 0 444 17
world? 0 444 17

This 0 444 18
is 0 444 18
Columbia. 0 444 18

Sofia 0 444 19
Jao, 0 444 19
BC 0 444 19
‘22, 0 444 19
problems 0 444 19
with 0 444 19
the 0 444 19

resided 0 444 19
not 0 444 19
in 0 444 19
the 0 444 19
set, 0 444 19
but 0 444 19
with 0 444 19
Patel’s 0 444 19
closing 0 444 19
remarks. 0 444 19

“I 0 444 20
really 0 444 20
dislike 0 444 20
when 0 444 20
people 0 444 20
who 0 444 20
are 0 444 20
older 0 444 20

the 0 444 20

Obviously 0 444 21
the 0 444 21
world 0 444 21
is 0 444 21
not 0 444 21
a 0 444 21
safe 0 444 21

just 0 444 21
accepting 0 444 21
that 0 444 21
