The 1

right 1
wing 1
Ecuadorean 1
government 1
of 1
President 1
Moreno 1
continues 1
to 1
churn 1
out 1
its 1
production 1
line 1

fake 1
documents 1

Amazingly, 0
more 0
Ecuadorean 0

documents 0
have 0
just 0

for 0
the 0

this 0

reports 0
detailing 0
visits 0
of 0
Paul 0
Manafort 0
and 0
unspecified 1
“Russians” 1
to 0
the 0
Embassy. 0

By 1
a 1
wonderful 1
coincidence 1
of 1
timing, 1
this 0
is 0
the 0
day 0
after 0
Mueller 0
announced 0
that 0
Manafort’s 0
plea 0
deal 0
was 0
over. 0

The 0
problem 0
with 0
this 0
latest 0
fabrication 0
is 0
that 0
Moreno 0
had 0
already 0
released 0
the 0
visitor 0
logs 0
to 0
the 0
Mueller 0
inquiry. 0

Neither 0
Manafort 0
nor 0
these 0
“Russians” 1
are 0
in 0
the 0
visitor 0
logs. 0

This 0
is 0
impossible. 0

The 0
visitor 0
logs 0
were 0
not 0
kept 0
by 0
Wikileaks, 0
but 0
by 0
the 0
very 0
strict 0
Ecuadorean 0
security. 0

Nobody 0
was 0
ever 0
admitted 0
without 0
being 0
entered 0
in 0
the 0
logs. 0

The 0
procedure 0
was 0
very 0
thorough. 0

To 0
go 0
in, 0
you 0
had 0
to 0
submit 0
your 0
passport 0
(no 0
other 0
type 0
of 0
document 0
was 0
accepted). 0

A 0
copy 0
of 0
your 0
passport 0
was 0
taken 0
and 0
the 0
passport 0
details 0
entered 0
into 0
the 0
log. 0

Your 0
passport, 0
along 0
with 0
your 0
mobile 0
phone 0
and 0
any 0
other 0
electronic 0
equipment, 0
was 0
retained 0
until 0
you 0
left, 0
along 0
with 0
your 0
bag 0
and 0
coat. 0

I 0
feature 0
in 0
the 0
logs 0
every 0
time 0
I 0
visited. 0

There 0
were 0
no 0
exceptions. 0

For 0
an 0
exception 0
to 0
be 0
made 0
for 0
Manafort 0
and 0
the 1
“Russians” 1
would 0
have 0
had 0
to 0
be 0
a 0
decision 0
of 0
the 0
Government 0
of 0
Ecuador, 0
not 0
of 0
Wikileaks, 0
and 0
that 0
would 0
be 0
so 0
exceptional 0
the 0
reason 0
for 0
it 0
would 0
surely 0
have 0
been 0
noted 0
in 0
the 0
now 0
leaked 0
supposed 0
Ecuadorean 0
“intelligence 0
report” 0
of 0
the 0
visits. 0

What 0
possible 0
motive 0
would 0
the 0
Ecuadorean 0
government 0
have 0
for 0
facilitating 0
secret 0
unrecorded 0
visits 0
by 0
Paul 0
Manafort? 0

Furthermore 0
it 0
is 0
impossible 0
that 0
the 0
intelligence 0
agency 0
– 0
who 0
were 0
in 0
charge 0
of 0
the 0
security 0
– 0
would 0
not 0
know 0
the 0
identity 0
of 0
these 0
alleged 0
“Russians”. 1

Previously 1
Harding 1
and 1
the 1
Guardian 1
have 1
published 1
documents 1
faked 1
by 1
the 1
Moreno 1
government 1
regarding 1
a 1
diplomatic 1
appointment 1
to 1
Russia 1
for 1
Assange 1
of 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
no 1
knowledge. 1

Now 1
they 1
follow 1
this 1
up 1
with 1
more 1
documents 1
aimed 1
to 1
provide 1
fictitious 1
evidence 1
to 1
bolster 1
Mueller’s 1
pathetically 1
failed 1
attempt 1
to 1
substantiate 1
the 1
story 1
that 1
Russia 1
deprived 1
Hillary 1
of 1
the 1
Presidency. 1

My 0
friend 0
William 0
Binney, 0
probably 1
the 1
world’s 1
greatest 1
expert 1
on 1
electronic 1
surveillance, 1
former 0
Technical 0
Director 0
of 0
the 0
NSA, 0
has 0
stated 0
that 0
it 0
is 0
impossible 0
the 0
DNC 0
servers 0
were 0
hacked, 0
the 0
technical 0
evidence 0
shows 0
it 0
was 0
a 0
download 0
to 0
a 0
directly 0
connected 0
memory 0
stick. 0

I 1
knew 1
the 1
US 1
security 1
services 1
were 1
conducting 1
a 1
fake 1
investigation 1
the 1
moment 1
it 1
became 1
clear 1
that 1
the 1
FBI 1
did 1
not 1
even 1
themselves 1
look 1
at 1
the 1
DNC 1
servers, 1
instead 1
accepting 1
a 1
report 1
from 1
the 1
Clinton 1
linked 1
DNC 1
“security 1
consultants” 1
Crowdstrike. 1

I 0
would 0
love 0
to 0
believe 0
that 0
the 0
fact 0
Julian 0
has 0
never 0
met 0
Manafort 0
is 0
bound 0
to 0
be 0
established. 0

But 1
I 1
fear 1
that 1
state 1
control 1
of 1
propaganda 1
may 1
be 1
such 1
that 1
this 1
massive 1
“Big 1
Lie” 1
will 1
come 1
to 1
enter 1
public 1
consciousness 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
way 1
as 1
the 1
non-existent 1
Russian 1
hack 1
of 1
the 1
DNC 1
servers. 1

Assange 1
never 1
met 1
Manafort. 1

The 1
DNC 1
emails 1
were 1
downloaded 1
by 1
an 1
insider. 1

Assange 1
never 1
even 1
considered 1
fleeing 1
to 1
Russia. 1

Those 1
are 1
the 1
facts, 1
and 1
I 1
am 1
in 1
a 1
position 1
to 1
give 1
you 1
a 1
personal 1
assurance 1
of 1
them. 1

I 1
can 1
also 1
assure 1
you 1
that 1
Luke 1
Harding, 1
the 1
Guardian, 1
Washington 1
Post 1
and 1
New 1
York 1
Times 1
have 1
been 1
publishing 1
a 1
stream 1
of 1
deliberate 1
lies, 1
in 1
collusion 1
with 1
the 1
security 1
services. 1

I 0
am 0
not 0
a 0
fan 0
of 0
Donald 0
Trump. 0

But 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
partisans 1
of 1
the 1
defeated 1
candidate 1
(and 1
a 1
particularly 1
obnoxious 1
defeated 1
candidate) 1
manipulate 1
the 1
security 1
services 1
and 1
the 1
media 1
to 1
create 1
an 1
entirely 1
false 1
public 1
perception, 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
attempt 1
to 1
overturn 1
the 1
result 1
of 1
the 1
US 1
Presidential 1
election, 1
is 1
the 1
most 1
astonishing 1
thing 1
I 1
have 1
witnessed 1
in 1
my 1
lifetime. 1

Plainly 1
the 1
government 1
of 1
Ecuador 1
is 1
releasing 1
lies 1
about 1
Assange 1
to 1
curry 1
favour 1
with 1
the 1
security 1
establishment 1
of 1
the 1
USA 1
and 1
UK, 1
and 1
to 1
damage 1
Assange’s 1
support 1
prior 1
to 1
expelling 1
him 1
from 1
the 1
Embassy. 1

He 1
will 1
then 1
be 1
extradited 1
from 1
London 1
to 1
the 1
USA 1
on 1
charges 1
of 1
espionage. 1

Assange 0
is 0
not 0
a 1
whistleblower 1
or 1
a 1
spy 1
– 0
he 0
is 0
the 1
greatest 1
publisher 1
of 1
his 1
age, 1
and 1
has 1
done 1
more 1
to 1
bring 1
the 1
crimes 1
of 1
governments 1
to 1
light 1
than 1
the 1
mainstream 1
media 1
will 1
ever 1
be 1
motivated 1
to 1
achieve. 1

That 1
supposedly 1
great 1
newspaper 1
titles 1
like 1
the 1
Guardian, 1
New 1
York 1
Times 1
and 1
Washington 1
Post 1
are 1
involved 1
in 1
the 1
spreading 1
of 1
lies 1
to 1
damage 1
Assange, 1
and 1
are 1
seeking 1
his 1
imprisonment 1
for 1
publishing 1
state 1
secrets, 1
is 1
clear 1
evidence 1
that 1
the 1
idea 1
of 1
the 1
“liberal 1
media” 1
no 1
longer 1
exists 1
in 1
the 1
new 1
plutocratic 1
age. 1

The 1
press 1
are 1
not 1
on 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
people, 1
they 1
are 1
an 1
instrument 1
of 1
elite 1
control. 1
