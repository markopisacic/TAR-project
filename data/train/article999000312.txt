By 1 414 4
a 1 414 4
wonderful 1 414 4
coincidence 1 414 4
of 1 414 4
timing, 1 414 4
this 0 414 4
is 0 414 4
the 0 414 4
day 0 414 4
after 0 414 4

that 0 414 4
Manafort’s 0 414 4

over. 0 414 4

The 0 414 5
problem 0 414 5
with 0 414 5
this 0 414 5
latest 0 414 5
fabrication 0 414 5
is 0 414 5
that 0 414 5
Moreno 0 414 5

already 0 414 5
released 0 414 5
the 0 414 5

to 0 414 5
the 0 414 5
Mueller 0 414 5

Neither 0 414 6

these 0 414 6
“Russians” 1 414 6
are 0 414 6
in 0 414 6
the 0 414 6
visitor 0 414 6
logs. 0 414 6

This 0 414 7
is 0 414 7
impossible. 0 414 7

The 0 414 8
visitor 0 414 8

were 0 414 8
not 0 414 8
kept 0 414 8
by 0 414 8
Wikileaks, 0 414 8
but 0 414 8
by 0 414 8
the 0 414 8
very 0 414 8
strict 0 414 8
Ecuadorean 0 414 8
security. 0 414 8

Nobody 0 414 9
was 0 414 9
ever 0 414 9
admitted 0 414 9
without 0 414 9

The 0 414 10
procedure 0 414 10
was 0 414 10
very 0 414 10
thorough. 0 414 10

To 0 414 11
go 0 414 11
in, 0 414 11
you 0 414 11
had 0 414 11

A 0 414 12
copy 0 414 12

your 0 414 12

with 0 414 13
your 0 414 13
bag 0 414 13
and 0 414 13

I 0 414 14
feature 0 414 14
in 0 414 14
the 0 414 14
logs 0 414 14
every 0 414 14
time 0 414 14
I 0 414 14
visited. 0 414 14

There 0 414 15
were 0 414 15
no 0 414 15
exceptions. 0 414 15

For 0 414 16
an 0 414 16
exception 0 414 16
to 0 414 16
be 0 414 16
made 0 414 16

Manafort 0 414 16

the 1 414 16
“Russians” 1 414 16
would 0 414 16
have 0 414 16
had 0 414 16
to 0 414 16
be 0 414 16
a 0 414 16
decision 0 414 16
of 0 414 16
the 0 414 16
Government 0 414 16
of 0 414 16
Ecuador, 0 414 16
not 0 414 16
of 0 414 16
Wikileaks, 0 414 16
and 0 414 16
that 0 414 16
would 0 414 16
be 0 414 16
so 0 414 16
exceptional 0 414 16
the 0 414 16
reason 0 414 16
for 0 414 16
it 0 414 16
would 0 414 16
surely 0 414 16
have 0 414 16
been 0 414 16
noted 0 414 16
in 0 414 16
the 0 414 16
now 0 414 16
leaked 0 414 16
supposed 0 414 16
Ecuadorean 0 414 16
“intelligence 0 414 16
report” 0 414 16
of 0 414 16
the 0 414 16
visits. 0 414 16

What 0 414 17
possible 0 414 17
motive 0 414 17
would 0 414 17
the 0 414 17
Ecuadorean 0 414 17
government 0 414 17
have 0 414 17
for 0 414 17
facilitating 0 414 17
secret 0 414 17
unrecorded 0 414 17
visits 0 414 17
by 0 414 17
Paul 0 414 17
Manafort? 0 414 17

Furthermore 0 414 18
it 0 414 18
is 0 414 18
impossible 0 414 18
that 0 414 18
the 0 414 18
intelligence 0 414 18
agency 0 414 18
– 0 414 18
who 0 414 18
were 0 414 18
in 0 414 18
charge 0 414 18
of 0 414 18
the 0 414 18
security 0 414 18
– 0 414 18
would 0 414 18
not 0 414 18
know 0 414 18
the 0 414 18
identity 0 414 18
of 0 414 18
these 0 414 18
alleged 0 414 18
“Russians”. 1 414 18

Previously 1 414 19
Harding 1 414 19
and 1 414 19
the 1 414 19
Guardian 1 414 19
have 1 414 19
published 1 414 19
documents 1 414 19
faked 1 414 19
by 1 414 19
the 1 414 19
Moreno 1 414 19
government 1 414 19
regarding 1 414 19
a 1 414 19
diplomatic 1 414 19
appointment 1 414 19
to 1 414 19
Russia 1 414 19
for 1 414 19
Assange 1 414 19
of 1 414 19
which 1 414 19
he 1 414 19
had 1 414 19
no 1 414 19
knowledge. 1 414 19

Now 1 414 20
they 1 414 20
follow 1 414 20
this 1 414 20
up 1 414 20
with 1 414 20
more 1 414 20
documents 1 414 20
aimed 1 414 20
to 1 414 20
provide 1 414 20
fictitious 1 414 20

to 1 414 20
bolster 1 414 20
Mueller’s 1 414 20
pathetically 1 414 20
failed 1 414 20
attempt 1 414 20
to 1 414 20
substantiate 1 414 20
the 1 414 20
story 1 414 20
that 1 414 20
Russia 1 414 20
deprived 1 414 20
Hillary 1 414 20
of 1 414 20
the 1 414 20

My 0 414 21
friend 0 414 21
William 0 414 21
Binney, 0 414 21
probably 1 414 21
the 1 414 21
world’s 1 414 21
greatest 1 414 21
expert 1 414 21
on 1 414 21
electronic 1 414 21
surveillance, 1 414 21
former 0 414 21
Technical 0 414 21
Director 0 414 21
of 0 414 21
the 0 414 21
NSA, 0 414 21
has 0 414 21
stated 0 414 21
that 0 414 21
it 0 414 21
is 0 414 21
impossible 0 414 21
the 0 414 21
DNC 0 414 21
servers 0 414 21
were 0 414 21
hacked, 0 414 21
the 0 414 21
technical 0 414 21
evidence 0 414 21
shows 0 414 21
it 0 414 21
was 0 414 21
a 0 414 21
download 0 414 21

a 0 414 21
directly 0 414 21
connected 0 414 21
memory 0 414 21
stick. 0 414 21

I 1 414 22
knew 1 414 22
the 1 414 22
US 1 414 22
security 1 414 22
services 1 414 22
were 1 414 22
conducting 1 414 22
a 1 414 22
fake 1 414 22
investigation 1 414 22
the 1 414 22
moment 1 414 22
it 1 414 22
became 1 414 22
clear 1 414 22
that 1 414 22
the 1 414 22
FBI 1 414 22
did 1 414 22
not 1 414 22
even 1 414 22
themselves 1 414 22
look 1 414 22
at 1 414 22
the 1 414 22
DNC 1 414 22
servers, 1 414 22
instead 1 414 22
accepting 1 414 22
a 1 414 22
report 1 414 22
from 1 414 22
the 1 414 22
Clinton 1 414 22
linked 1 414 22
DNC 1 414 22
“security 1 414 22
consultants” 1 414 22
Crowdstrike. 1 414 22

I 0 414 23
would 0 414 23
love 0 414 23
to 0 414 23
believe 0 414 23
that 0 414 23
the 0 414 23
fact 0 414 23
Julian 0 414 23
has 0 414 23
never 0 414 23
met 0 414 23
Manafort 0 414 23
is 0 414 23
bound 0 414 23
to 0 414 23
be 0 414 23
established. 0 414 23

But 1 414 24
I 1 414 24
fear 1 414 24
that 1 414 24
state 1 414 24
control 1 414 24
of 1 414 24
propaganda 1 414 24
may 1 414 24
be 1 414 24
such 1 414 24
that 1 414 24
this 1 414 24
massive 1 414 24
“Big 1 414 24
Lie” 1 414 24
will 1 414 24
come 1 414 24
to 1 414 24
enter 1 414 24
public 1 414 24
consciousness 1 414 24
in 1 414 24
the 1 414 24
same 1 414 24
way 1 414 24
as 1 414 24
the 1 414 24
non-existent 1 414 24
Russian 1 414 24
hack 1 414 24
of 1 414 24
the 1 414 24
DNC 1 414 24
servers. 1 414 24

Assange 1 414 25
never 1 414 25
met 1 414 25
Manafort. 1 414 25

The 1 414 26
DNC 1 414 26
emails 1 414 26
were 1 414 26
downloaded 1 414 26
by 1 414 26
an 1 414 26
insider. 1 414 26

Assange 1 414 27
never 1 414 27
even 1 414 27
considered 1 414 27
fleeing 1 414 27
to 1 414 27
Russia. 1 414 27

Those 1 414 28
are 1 414 28
the 1 414 28
facts, 1 414 28
and 1 414 28
I 1 414 28
am 1 414 28
in 1 414 28
a 1 414 28
position 1 414 28
to 1 414 28
give 1 414 28
you 1 414 28
a 1 414 28
personal 1 414 28
assurance 1 414 28
of 1 414 28
them. 1 414 28

I 1 414 29
can 1 414 29
also 1 414 29
assure 1 414 29
you 1 414 29
that 1 414 29
Luke 1 414 29
Harding, 1 414 29
the 1 414 29
Guardian, 1 414 29
Washington 1 414 29
Post 1 414 29
and 1 414 29
New 1 414 29
York 1 414 29
Times 1 414 29
have 1 414 29
been 1 414 29
publishing 1 414 29
a 1 414 29
stream 1 414 29
of 1 414 29
deliberate 1 414 29
lies, 1 414 29
in 1 414 29
collusion 1 414 29
with 1 414 29
the 1 414 29
security 1 414 29
services. 1 414 29

I 0 414 30
am 0 414 30
not 0 414 30
a 0 414 30
fan 0 414 30
of 0 414 30
Donald 0 414 30
Trump. 0 414 30

But 1 414 31
to 1 414 31
see 1 414 31
the 1 414 31
partisans 1 414 31
of 1 414 31
the 1 414 31
defeated 1 414 31
candidate 1 414 31
(and 1 414 31
a 1 414 31
particularly 1 414 31
obnoxious 1 414 31
defeated 1 414 31
candidate) 1 414 31
manipulate 1 414 31
the 1 414 31
security 1 414 31
services 1 414 31
and 1 414 31
the 1 414 31
media 1 414 31
to 1 414 31
create 1 414 31
an 1 414 31
entirely 1 414 31
false 1 414 31
public 1 414 31
perception, 1 414 31
in 1 414 31
order 1 414 31
to 1 414 31
attempt 1 414 31
to 1 414 31
overturn 1 414 31
the 1 414 31
result 1 414 31
of 1 414 31
the 1 414 31
US 1 414 31
Presidential 1 414 31
election, 1 414 31
is 1 414 31
the 1 414 31
most 1 414 31
astonishing 1 414 31
thing 1 414 31
I 1 414 31
have 1 414 31
witnessed 1 414 31
in 1 414 31
my 1 414 31
lifetime. 1 414 31

Plainly 1 414 32
the 1 414 32
government 1 414 32
of 1 414 32
Ecuador 1 414 32
is 1 414 32
releasing 1 414 32
lies 1 414 32
about 1 414 32
Assange 1 414 32
to 1 414 32
curry 1 414 32
favour 1 414 32
with 1 414 32
the 1 414 32
security 1 414 32
establishment 1 414 32
of 1 414 32
the 1 414 32
USA 1 414 32
and 1 414 32
UK, 1 414 32
and 1 414 32
to 1 414 32
damage 1 414 32
Assange’s 1 414 32
support 1 414 32
prior 1 414 32
to 1 414 32
expelling 1 414 32
him 1 414 32
from 1 414 32
the 1 414 32
Embassy. 1 414 32

He 1 414 33
will 1 414 33
then 1 414 33
be 1 414 33
extradited 1 414 33
from 1 414 33
