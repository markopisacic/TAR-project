SPECIAL 0
REPORT: 0
Papal 0
Cover-up 0
Alleged, 0
Pope 0
Accused 0
in 0
International 0
Sex 0
Abuse 0
Case 0

Hey, 0
remember 0
five 0
minutes 0
ago 0
when 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
shouted 0
at 0
a 0
reporter 0
in 0
Chile 0
that 0
there 0
was 0
“no 0
evidence” 0
supporting 0
complaints 0
against 0
his 1
good 1
friend 1
Bishop 1
Juan 1
Barros? 1

And, 0
just 0
for 0
good 0
measure 0
he 0
accused 0
the 0
people 0
accusing 0
him 0
– 0
victims 0
of 0
sexual 0
abuse 0
by 0
Barros’ 0
mentor, 0
the 1
convicted 1
sex-predator 1
Karadima 1
– 0
of 0
committing 0
“calumny”? 1

[1] 0
And 0
remember 0
when 0
Cardinal 0
O’Malley 0
told 0
the 0
pope 0
off 0
in 0
public 0
over 0
the 0
“pain” 1
these 0
accusations 0
had 0
caused 0
the 0
victims 0
of 0
sexual 0
abuse? 0

And 0
then 0
remember 0
how 0
the 0
pope 0
had 1
apologised-except-not-really 1
because 0
the 1
accusations 1
are, 1
after 1
all, 1
still 1
lies, 1
and 1
that 1
there’s 1
still 1
“no 1
evidence” 1
against 1
Barros…? 1

The 0
press, 0
secular 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
Catholic, 0
is 0
full 0
this 0
week 0
of 0
the 0
story 0
that 0
the 0
pope 0
did 0
indeed 0
see 0
evidence 0
of 0
Barros’ 0
complicity 0
in 0
Karadima’s 0
sexual 0
abuse 0
– 0
not 0
only 0
that 0
Barros 0
had 0
helped 0
to 0
cover 0
it 0
up 0
but 0
that 0
he 0
had 0
been 0
present 0
and 0
a 0
direct 0
witness 0
at 0
the 0
time 0
and 0
therefore 0
a 0
passive 0
participant. 0

Nicole 0
Winfield 0
and 0
the 0
Associated 0
Press 0
dropped 1
the 1
bomb 1
that 0
the 0
information 0
came 0
directly 0
from 0
the 0
victims, 0
whom 0
Francis 0
had 0
dismissed 0
and 0
refused 0
to 0
meet 0
with 0
on 0
his 0
trip, 0
and 0
delivered 0
through 0
his 0
own 0
Commission 0
on 0
sexual 0
abuse: 0

Pope 0
Francis 0
received 0
a 0
victim’s 0
letter 0
in 0
2015 0
that 0
graphically 0
detailed 0
how 0
a 0
priest 0
sexually 0
abused 0
him 0
and 0
how 0
other 0
Chilean 0
clergy 0
ignored 0
it, 0
contradicting 0
the 0
pope’s 0
recent 0
insistence 0
that 0
no 0
victims 0
had 0
come 0
forward 0
to 0
denounce 0
the 0
cover-up, 0
the 0
letter’s 0
author 0
and 0
members 0
of 0
Francis’ 0
own 0
sex- 0
abuse 0
commission 0
have 0
told 0
The 0
Associated 0
Press. 0

The 0

fact 0
that 0
Francis 0
received 0
the 0
eight-page 0
letter, 0
obtained 0
by 0
the 0
AP, 0
challenges 0
his 0
insistence 0
that 0
he 0
has 0
“zero 0
tolerance” 0
for 0
sex 0
abuse 0
and 0
cover-ups. 0

It 1
also 1
calls 1
into 1
question 1
his 1
stated 1
empathy 1
with 1
abuse 1
survivors, 1
compounding 0
the 0
most 0
serious 0
crisis 0
of 0
his 0
five-year 0
papacy. 0

Now 0
it 0
appears 0
that 0
Francis 0
had 0
also 0
overruled 0
a 0
2015 0
warning 0
from 0
the 0
Congregation 0
for 0
the 0
Doctrine 0
of 0
the 0
Faith 0
that 0
Barros 0
should 0
not 0
be 0
made 0
a 0
bishop. 0

The 0
Italian 0
Catholic 0
daily 0
La 0
Nuova 0
Bussola 0
Quotidiana 0
reports 0
that 0
not 0
only 0
did 0
the 0
pope 0
see 0
a 0
letter 0
from 0
victims, 0
but 0
that 0
the 0
CDF, 0
under 0
Muller, 0
“had 0
already 0
conducted 0
an 0
preliminary 0
investigation 0
into 0
Barros 0
and 0
the 0
other 0
bishops 0
close 0
to 0
Karadima 0
which 0
had 0
led 0
to 0
the 0
decision 0
to 0
relieve 0
them 0
of 0
their 0
duties.” 0

“But 0
with 0
a 0
letter 0
signed 0
by 0
the 0
Pope 0
in 0
January 0
2015 0
and 0
sent 0
to 0
the 0
Chilean 0
bishops, 0
the 0
request 0
for 0
exemption 0
is 0
blocked 0
and 0
shortly 0
thereafter 0
Barros 0
is 0
promoted 0
to…Osorno.” 0

The 0
article 0
points 0
out 0
that 0
while 0
Karadima 0
was 0
convicted 0
by 0
a 0
Vatican 0
tribunal 0
on 0
the 0
testimony 0
of 0
the 0
victims, 0
it 0
is 0
the 0
same 0
testimony 0
of 0
the 0
same 0
victim-witnesses 0
that 0
Francis 0
now 0
dismisses 0
in 0
the 0
accusations 0
against 0
Barros. 0

The 0
accusations 0
that 0
stood 0
against 0
Karadima 0
come 0
from 0
the 0
same 0
sources 0
as 0
those 0
against 0
Barros, 0
who 0
the 0
victims 0
said 0
was 0
in 0
the 0
room 0
watching 0
at 0
the 0
time. 0

While 0
the 0
specifics 0
are 0
still 0
not 0
known, 0
readers 0
may 0
be 0
reminded 0
by 0
this 0
of 0
a 0
peculiar 0
incident 0
about 0
a 0
year 0
later 0
in 0
which 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
summarily 0
ordered 0
the 0
dismissal 0
of 0
three 0
priests 0
of 0
the 0
CDF, 0
whose 0
remit 0
was 0
investigations 0
of 0
clerics 0
accused 0
of 0
sexual 0
abuse. 0

The 0
website 0
One 0
Peter 0
Five 0
reports, 0
via 0
Marco 0
Tosatti, 0
that 0
the 0
pope 0
ordered 0
their 0
removal 0
without 0
offering 0
any 0
explanation 0
to 0
then-cardinal 0
prefect 0
Gerhard 0
Muller. 0

When, 0
after 0
several 0
attempts 0
and 0
three 0
months 0
later[2], 0
Muller 0
was 0
able 0
to 0
get 0
an 0
audience 0
with 0
the 0
pope 0
to 0
ask 0
the 0
reason, 0
he 0
received 0
the 0
response, 0
“I 0
am 1
the 1
pope, 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
need 1
to 1
give 1
reasons 1
for 1
any 1
of 1
my 1
decisions. 1

I 1
have 1
decided 1
that 1
they 1
have 1
to 1
leave 1
and 1
they 1
have 1
to 1
leave.” 1

Marco 0
Tosatti 0
reports 0
the 0
CDF 0
incident, 0
but 0
it 0
follows 0
an 0
odd 0
story 0
of 0
a 0
meeting 0
of 0
curial 0
officials 0
to 0
discuss 0
certain 0
bishop 0
appointments. 0

Without 0
naming 0
names, 0
(or, 0
frustratingly, 0
giving 0
dates[3]) 0
Tosatti 0
relates: 0

“It 0
was 0
some 0
time 0
ago 0
to 0
make 0
a 0
bishop, 0
not 0
in 0
Italy. 0

The 0
nuncio 0
has 0
prepared 0
the 0
triad 0
[the 0
“terna” 0
or 0
list 0
of 0
three 0
candidates]. 0

A 0
cardinal, 0
head 0
of 0
the 0
dicastery, 0
perhaps 0
the 0
same 0
holder 0
of 0
the 0
Congregation 0
for 0
Bishops, 0
during 0
the 0
ordinary 0
assembly 0
took 0
the 0
floor, 0
saying: 0
‘The 0
first 0
candidate 0
indicated 0
is 0
excellent, 0
the 0
second 0
is 0
good. 0

But 0
I 0
would 0
like 0
to 0
warn 0
of 0
the 0
third, 0
whom 0
I 0
know 0
well, 0
since 0
he 0
was 0
a 0
seminarian, 0
and 0
who 0
presents 0
problems 0
both 0
on 0
the 0
level 0
of 0
doctrine 0
and 0
morality. 0

He 0
responds 0
little 0
to 0
the 0
necessary 0
criteria. 0

But 0
the 0
third 0
was 0
a 0
friend 0
of 0
someone 0
and 0
another 0
cardinal, 0
of 0
the 0
circle 0
currently 0
in 0
power, 0
has 0
flung 0
himself 0
at 0
his 0
colleague, 0
accusing 0
him 0
of 0
impropriety.’ 0
The 0
meeting 0
ended 0
without 0
further 0
decisions.” 0

Whatever 0
the 0
details 0
of 0
these 0
strange 0
incidents, 0
what 0
is 0
clear 0
in 0
Chile 0
is 0
that 0
no 0
amount 0
of 0
eyewitness 0
testimony 0
was 0
going 0
to 0
make 0
the 0
slightest 0
difference. 0

Bergoglio 0
wanted 0
Barros 0
as 0
a 0
bishop 0
and 0
that 0
was 0
that. 0

Even 0
while 0
“apologising” 0
the 0
pope 0
had 0
doubled 0
down 0
when 0
questioned 0
about 0
it 0
by 0
journalists, 0
saying, 0
“You, 0
in 0
all 0
good 0
will, 0
tell 0
me 0
that 0
there 0
are 0
victims, 0
but 0
I 0
haven’t 0
seen 0
any, 0
because 0
they 0
haven’t 0
come 0
forward.” 0

“In 0
the 0
case 0
of 0
Barros 0
it’s 0
been 0
observed, 0
it’s 0
been 0
studied; 0
there’s 0
no 0
evidence. 0

The 0
best 0
thing 0
to 0
do 0
if 0
someone 0
believes 0
it’s 0
the 0
case 0
is 0
to 0
come 0
forward 0
quickly 0
with 0
evidence.” 0

The 0
AP 0
report, 0
however, 0
says 0
exactly 0
the 0
opposite; 0
that 0
members 0
of 0
his 0
own 0
(now 0
defunct[4]) 0
abuse 0
Commission 0
had 0
approached 0
Cardinal 0
O’Malley, 0
the 0
pope’s 0
“top 0
abuse 0
advisor,” 0
with 0
the 0
letter 0
to 0
deliver 0
to 0
the 0
pope. 0

Marie 0
Collins, 0
the 0
Irish 0
abuse 0
survivor 0
and 0
Commission 0
member 0
who 0
resigned, 0
citing 0
the 0
Vatican’s 0
refusal 0
to 0
take 0
meaningful 0
action, 0
told 0
AP, 0
“When 0
we 0
gave 0
him 0
[O’Malley] 0
the 0
letter 0
for 0
the 0
pope, 0
he 0
assured 0
us 0
he 0
would 0
give 0
it 0
to 0
the 0
pope 0
and 0
speak 0
of 0
the 0
concerns. 0

And 0
at 0
a 0
later 0
date, 0
he 0
assured 0
us 0
that 0
that 0
had 0
been 0
done.” 0
Juan 0
Carlos 0
Cruz, 0
the 0
Karadima 0
victim 0
whose 0
membership 0
on 0
the 0
Commission 0
the 0
Vatican 0
had 0
blocked, 0
told 0
AP, 0
“Cardinal 0
O’Malley 0
called 0
me 0
after 0
the 0
pope’s 0
visit 0
here 0
in 0
Philadelphia 0
and 0
he 0
told 0
me, 0
among 0
other 0
things, 0
that 0
he 0
had 0
given 0
the 0
letter 0
to 0
the 0
pope 0
– 0
in 1
his 1
hands.” 1

On 0
the 0
face 0
of 0
it, 0
there 0
are 0
only 0
a 0
few 0
logical 0
possibilities 0
here. 0

In 0
fact, 0
unless 0
Cardinal 0
O’Malley 0
– 0
who 0
has, 0
as 0
of 0
this 0
writing, 0
remained 0
silent 0
– 0
comes 0
forward 0
and 0
says 0
that 0
he 0
didn’t 0
hand 0
the 0
letter 0
over 0
pope, 0
there 0
is 0
really 0
only 0
one; 0
that 0
the 0
pope 0
lied. 0

And 0
this 0
is 0
what 0
is 0
now 0
being 0
said 0
quite 0
openly 0
by 0
a 0
vast 0
array 0
of 0
voices, 0
secular 0
and 0
Catholic, 0
left 0
and 0
right. 0

As 0
Winfield 0
writes, 0

“The 0
revelation 0
could 0
be 0
costly 0
for 0
Francis, 0
whose 0
track 0
record 0
on 0
the 0
abuse 0
crisis 0
was 0
already 0
shaky 0
after 0
a 0
botched 0
Italian 0
abuse 0
case 0
he 0
intervened 0
in 0
became 0
public[5]. 0

More 0
recently, 0
he 0
let 0
the 0
abuse 0
commission 0
lapse 0
at 0
the 0
end 0
of 0
last 0
year. 0

Vatican 0
analysts 0
now 0
openly 0
question 0
whether 0
he 0
‘gets 0
it,’ 0
and 0
some 0
of 0
his 0
own 0
advisers 0
privately 0
acknowledge 0
that 0
maybe 0
he 0
doesn’t.” 0

“No 0
evidence…” 0
Lie 1
big, 1
lie 1
often, 1
and 1
when 1
caught, 1
keep 1
lying. 1

One 0
of 0
the 0
many 0
things 0
these 0
secular 1
reporters 1
seem 0
not 0
to 0
be 0
paying 0
attention 0
to 0
is 0
that 0
“no 0
evidence” 0
is 0
in 0
fact 0
a 0
well-rehearsed, 0
stock 0
response 0
for 0
Bergoglio. 0

He 0
said 0
almost 0
exactly 0
the 0
same 0
in 0
2013 0
when 0
confronted 0
about 0
another 0
predatory 1
homosexual 1
he 0
was 0
sheltering. 0

The 0
hoopla 0
surrounding 0
the 0
“Who 1
am 1
I 1
to 1
judge” 1
comment 0
tends 0
to 0
obscure 0
the 0
context 0
of 0
the 0
comment. 0

It 0
was 0
made 0
in 0
response 0
to 0
a 0
question 0
by 0
a 0
journalist 0
about 0
Monsignore 0
Battista 0
Ricca 0
– 0
a 0
prelate 0
whose 0
promiscuous 0
homosexuality 0
is 0
so 0
well 0
known 0
it 0
was 0
covered 0
by 0
the 0
Telegraph 0
as 0
early 0
as 0
July 0
2013. 0

Ilze 0
Scamparini 0
asked 0
the 0
pope 0
about 0
Ricca, 0
saying, 0
“What 0
you 0
intend 0
to 0
do 0
about 0
this? 0

How 0
are 0
you 0
confronting 0
this 0
issue 0
and 0
how 0
does 0
Your 0
Holiness 0
intend 0
to 0
confront 0
the 0
whole 0
question 0
of 0
the 0
gay 0
lobby?” 0

What 0
reply 0
did 0
Bergoglio 0
give? 0

His 0
standard 0
one: 0
“No 1
evidence.” 1

About 0
Monsignor 0
Ricca: 0
I 0
did 0
what 0
canon 0
law 0
calls 0
for, 0
that 0
is 0
a 0
preliminary 0
investigation. 0

And 0
from 0
this 0
investigation, 0
there 0
was 0
nothing 0
of 0
what 0
had 0
been 0
alleged. 0

We 0
did 0
not 0
find 0
anything 0
of 0
that. 0

This 0
is 0
the 0
response.” 0

He 0
added, 0
“In 0
this 0
case, 0
I 0
conducted 0
the 0
preliminary 0
investigation 0
and 0
we 0
didn’t 0
find 0
anything.” 0

But 0
Ricca’s 0
activities, 0
for 0
which 0
the 0
pope 0
claimed 0
there 0
was 0
no 0
evidence, 0
were 0
notorious. 0

They 0
include 0
being 0
caught 0
in 0
flagrante 0
in 0
an 0
elevator 0
with 0
a 0
teenaged 0
male 0
prostitute, 0
and 0
his 0
sexual 0
relationship 0
with 0
a 0
captain 0
in 0
the 0
Swiss 0
army. 0

So 0
flagrant 1
was 0
Ricca’s 0
behaviour 0
that 0
it 0
took 0
intervention 0
by 0
Uruguay’s 0
nuncio 0
to 0
have 0
him 0
removed. 0

It 0
was 0
reported 0
in 0
1999 0
and 0
2000 0
by 0
L’Espresso, 0
who 0
said 0
the 0
information 0
was 0
confirmed 0
by 0
“numerous 0
bishops, 0
priests, 0
religious 0
and 0
laity” 0
in 0
Uruguay[6]. 0

In 0
fact, 0
the 0
evidence 0
shows 0
that 0
Ricca 0
is 0
completely 0
in 0
line 0
with 0
Bergoglio’s 0
normal 0
procedures. 0

As 0
“Marcantonio 0
Colonna” 0
wrote 0
in 0
the 0
Dictator 0
Pope, 0
“In 0
fact 0
his 0
patronage 0
of 0
Monsignor 0
Ricca 0
fits 0
the 0
pattern 0
which 0
was 0
well 0
established 0
when 0
he 0
was 0
Archbishop 0
of 0
Buenos 0
Aires, 0
whereby 0
he 0
surrounds 0
himself 0
with 0
morally 0
weak 0
people 0
so 0
as 0
to 0
have 0
them 0
under 1
his 1
thumb.” 1

It 0
was 0
at 0
this 0
early 0
“no 0
evidence” 0
comment 0
on 0
the 0
plane 0
home 0
from 0
Rio 0
that 0
some 0
of 0
those 0
paying 0
attention 0
started 0
to 0
understand 0
that 0
Bergoglio’s 0
policy 0
is 0
in 0
line 0
with 0
that 0
of 0
certain 0
leaders 0
of 0
the 0
past 0
who 0
recommended 0
that 0
if 0
a 0
politician 0
was 0
going 0
to 0
lie, 0
he 0
should 0
lie 1
big 1
and 1
lie 1
brazenly. 1

And 0
in 0
case 0
anyone 0
was 0
wondering 0
what 0
will 0
happen 0
next, 0
the 0
same 0
advice 0
said 0
to 0
keep 0
on 0
lying 0
after 0
you’re 0
caught. 0

The 0
pattern 0
of 0
silence 0
and, 0
when 0
pressed, 0
flat-out 0
denial 0
has 0
been 0
Bergoglio’s 0
policy 0
since 0
long 0
before 0
he 0
came 0
on 0
the 0
international 0
scene. 0

He 0
has 0
a 0
long 0
record 0
in 0
Argentina 0
of 0
shaving 0
close 0
to 0
scandals 0
and 0
vociferously 0
denying 0
involvement, 0
and 0
relying 0
heavily 0
on 0
the 0
broad 0
good 0
will 0
of 0
Catholics 0
towards 0
bishops 0
to 0
pull 0
it 0
off. 0

Perhaps 0
his 0
biggest 0
error 0
with 0
Barros 0
was 0
failing 0
to 0
understand 0
just 0
how 0
little 0
of 0
that 0
capital 0
of 0
trust 0
there 0
is 0
left 0
in 0
the 0
Catholic 0
world 0
as 0
a 0
whole. 0

Indeed, 0
on 0
the 0
subject 0
of 0
priests 0
sexually 0
abusing 0
young 0
people, 0
it 0
could 0
only 0
be 0
measured 0
in 0
the 0
negative 0
numbers. 0

“Argentine 0
Victims 0
Who 0
Tried 0
to 0
Meet 0
with 0
Pope 0
Francis…” 0

Though 0
the 0
website 0
Bishop 0
Accountability 0
is 0
blatantly 0
anti-clerical, 0
their 0
data 0
is 0
unassailable 0
since 0
most 0
of 0
it 0
comes 0
from 0
information 0
that 0
is 0
already 0
public. 0

On 0
their 0
Argentina 0
page 0
is 0
a 0
long 0
list 0
of 0
accusations 0
that 0
Bergoglio/Francis 0
simply 0
isn’t 0
interested 0
in 0
hearing 0
from 0
victims. 0

“In 0
Pope 0
Francis’s 0
21 0
years 0
as 0
bishop 0
and 0
archbishop 0
of 0
Buenos 0
Aires, 0
the 0
Wall 0
Street 0
Journal 0
reports, 0
including 0
the 0
years 0
when 0
he 0
headed 0
the 0
Argentine 0
bishops’ 0
conference, 0
he 0
declined 0
to 0
meet 0
with 0
victims 0
of 0
sexual 0
abuse.” 0

“All 0

of 0
them 0
tried 0
to 0
contact 0
the 0
cardinal 0
archbishop 0
in 0
2002 0
or 0
later,” 0
the 0
same 0
period 0
when 0
Pope 0
Benedict 0
and 0
other 0
bishops 0
were 0
striving 0
to 0
meet 0
with 0
victims 0
and 0
demonstrate 0
an 0
interest 0
in 0
the 0
problem. 0

The 0
site 0
says 0
that 0
“in 0
addition 0
to 0
Bergoglio’s 0
failure 0
to 0
respond 0
to 0
victims, 0
the 0
public 0
record 0
contains 0
no 0
evidence 0
that 0
he 0
released 0
any 0
information 0
about 0
abusers.” 0

In 0
fact, 0
he 0
went 0
so 0
far 0
as 0
to 0
flatly 0
deny 0
there 0
had 0
been 0
any 0
instances 0
of 0
abuse 0
in 0
his 0
archdiocese. 0

Weeks 0
after 0
his 0
election 0
to 0
the 0
papacy, 0
he 0
was 0
quoted 0
by 0
his 0
close 0
friend, 0
Rabbi 0
Abraham 0
Skorka, 0
“In 0
my 0
diocese 0
it 0
never 0
happened 0
to 0
me, 0
but 0
a 0
bishop 0
called 0
me 0
once 0
by 0
phone 0
to 0
ask 0
me 0
what 0
to 0
do 0
in 0
a 0
situation 0
like 0
this.” 0
Francis 0
added 0
that 0
he 0
agreed 0
with 0
the 0
“zero 0
tolerance” 0
attitude 0
of 0
the 0
Irish 0
episcopate 0
and 0
admired 0
Pope 0
Benedict’s 0
reforms 0
– 0
most 0
of 0
which 0
he 0
was 0
later 0
to 0
quietly 0
reverse. 0

It 0
was 0
at 0
exactly 0
this 0
time, 0
however, 0
that 0
victims 0
from 0
Argentina 0
were 0
attempting 0
to 0
get 0
the 0
new 0
pope’s 0
attention. 0

One, 0
known 0
to 0
the 0
press 0
only 0
as 0
“Gabriel,” 0
wanted 0
to 0
talk 0
to 0
Francis 0
about 0
the 0
sexual 0
abuse 0
he 0
suffered 0
at 0
the 0
hands 0
of 0
Julio 0
César 0
Grassi, 0
accused 0
of 0
molesting 0
at 0
least 0
five 0
boys, 0
“who 0
has 0
been 0
avoiding 0
the 0
sentences 0
of 0
the 0
justice 0
of 0
Morón 0
and 0
the 0
Court 0
of 0
Cassation. 0

So 0
far, 0
judges 0
and 0
prosecutors 0
at 0
all 0
instances 0
found 0
him 0
guilty.” 0

In 0
case 0
anyone 0
thinks 0
the 0
Grassi-Gabriel 0
case 0
was 0
not 0
serious 0
enough 0
for 0
the 0
pope’s 0
attention, 0
Bishop 0
Accountability 0
summarises, 0
“A 0
year 0
after 0
Gabriel 0
had 0
filed 0
criminal 0
charges 0
[2003] 0
but 0
before 0
the 0
start 0
of 0
Grassi’s 0
trial, 0
three 0
men 0
ransacked 0
the 0
survivor’s 0
apartment 0
and 0
beat 0
him.” 0
These 0
men 0
threatened 0
to 0
kill 0
him 0
if 0
he 0
did 0
not 0
retract 0
his 0
testimony 0
and 0
quit 0
the 0
case. 0

Ten 0
years 0
[after 0
Gabriel 0
filed 0
criminal 0
charges], 0
in 0
May 0
2013, 0
with 0
Grassi 0
still 0
free 0
despite 0
his 0
conviction 0
in 0
2009, 0
“Gabriel 0
and 0
his 0
attorney, 0
Juan 0
Pablo 0
Gallego, 0
brought 0
a 0
two-page 0
letter 0
addressed 0
to 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
to 0
the 0
office 0
of 0
the 0
papal 0
nuncio 0
in 0
Buenos 0
Aires. 0

An 0
employee 0
refused 0
to 0
accept 0
the 0
letter 0
after 0
learning 0
of 0
its 0
topic 0
and 0
threatened 0
to 0
call 0
security 0
if 0
Gabriel 0
and 0
Gallego 0
did 0
not 0
leave 0
the 0
premises.” 0

The 0
group 0
surmises 0
that 0
it 0
was 0
Bergoglio’s 0
direct 0
intervention 0
with 0
judges 0
in 0
the 0
case 0
that 0
prevented 0
a 0
conviction 0
against 0
Grassi 0
for 0
so 0
long 0
and 0
delayed 0
his 0
sentencing 0
through 0
multiple 0
appeals. 0

In 0
2006, 0
then-Archbishop 0
Bergoglio 0
complained 0
of 0
a 0
“media 0
campaign” 0
and 0
claimed 0
that 0
the 0
Grassi 0
case 0
was 0
“different” 0
from 0
other 0
accusations. 0

During 0
his 0
criminal 0
trial 0
Grassi 0
said 0
Bergoglio 0
“never 0
let 0
go” 0
of 0
his 0
hand. 0

In 0
2009, 0
Grassi 0
was 0
convicted 0
of 0
two 0
counts 0
of 0
aggravated 0
sexual 0
assault 0
and 0
corruption 0
in 0
the 0
case 0
of 0
“Gabriel,” 0
who 0
was 0
aged 0
13 0
at 0
the 0
time 0
of 0
the 0
abuse, 0
but 0
the 0
appeals 0
dragged 0
on 0
until 0
he 0
was 0
finally 0
sent 0
to 0
prison 0
in 0
September 0
2013. 0

Several 0
more 0
similar 0
cases, 0
all 0
of 0
whom 0
were 0
rebuffed 0
in 0
their 0
attempts 0
to 0
meet 0
with 0
Bergoglio, 0
are 0
detailed 0
here, 0
for 1
the 1
strong-of-stomach. 1

A 1
virtuoso 1
performance-liar 1

Looking 0
back 0
and 0
carefully 0
examining 0
his 0
record, 0
Jorge 0
Bergoglio’s 0
mastery 1
of 0
using 0
the 0
weaknesses 0
of 0
morally 0
compromised 0
men 0
is 0
becoming 0
evident. 0

It 0
is 0
arguable 0
that 0
even 0
the 0
members 0
of 0
the 0
so-called 0
“San 0
Gallen 0
Mafia” 0
who 0
apparently 0
conspired 0
to 0
put 0
him 0
on 0
Peter’s 0
throne 0
were 0
used 0
by 0
him. 0

But 0
he 0
is 0
also 0
a 0
master 0
of 0
judging 0
an 0
audience 0
and 0
telling 0
them 0
what 0
they 0
expect 0
to 0
hear; 0
a 0
key 0
skill 0
for 0
all 0
grifters 0
and 0
confidence 0
tricksters. 0

Looking 0
carefully 0
at 0
the 0
infamous 0
“Who 0
am 0
I 0
to 0
judge” 0
comment, 0
this 0
was 0
clear 0
early 0
on. 0

The 0
first 0
part 0
of 0
that 0
interview 0
is 0
a 0
blatant 1
and 1
enormous 1
lie, 1
and 0
it 0
was 0
from 0
there 0
that 0
the 0
pope 0
moved 0
on 0
to 0
his 0
apology 0
for 0
homosexuality 0
in 0
general. 0

Recall 0
that 0
this 0
was 0
the 0
very 0
first 0
airplane 0
interview, 0
on 0
the 0
trip 0
back 0
to 0
Rome 0
from 0
World 0
Youth 0
Day 0
in 0
Rio, 0
a 0
matter 0
of 0
weeks 0
after 0
his 0
election. 0

At 0
the 0
time, 0
the 0
papal 1
apologists 1
sprang 0
instantly 0
into 0
action 0
and 0
we 0
heard 0
all 0
about 0
how 0
the 0
pope 0
was 0
talking 0
strictly 0
within 0
the 0
boundaries 0
of 0
Catholic 0
doctrine. 0

But 0
perhaps 0
in 0
hindsight, 0
we 0
are 0
ready 0
to 0
examine 0
the 0
full 0
implications 0
of 0
his 0
little 0
speech, 0
one 0
that 0
was 0
clearly 0
well-rehearsed. 0

(Don’t 0
forget, 0
no 0
question 0
is 0
asked 0
in 0
a 0
papal 0
interview 0
without 0
being 0
thoroughly 1
vetted 1
ahead 0
of 0
time. 0

Journalists 0
must 0
submit 0
their 0
questions 0
well 0
in 0
advance.) 0

This 0
was 0
the 0
pope 0
laying 0
out 0
his 0
policy 0
regarding 0
homosexuality, 0
a 0
policy 0
for 0
which 0
he 0
was 0
duly 1
rewarded 1
by 0
being 0
lauded 0
on 0
the 0
cover 0
of 0
the 0
homosexualist 0
lobby’s 0
US 0
trade 0
magazine. 0

Read 0
his 0
full 0
answer 0
carefully: 0

I 0
see 0
that 0
many 0
times 0
in 0
the 0
Church, 0
over 0
and 0
above 0
this 0
case, 0
but 0
including 0
this 0
case, 0
people 0
search 0
for 0
“sins 0
from 0
youth”, 0
for 0
example, 0
and 0
then 0
publish 0
them. 0

They 0
are 0
not 0
crimes, 0
right? 0

Crimes 0
are 0
something 0
different: 0
the 0
abuse 0
of 0
minors 0
is 0
a 0
crime. 0

No, 0
sins. 0

But 0

if 0
a 0
person, 0
whether 0
it 0
be 0
a 0
lay 0
person, 0
a 0
priest 0
or 0
a 0
religious 0
sister, 0
commits 0
a 0
sin 0
and 0
then 0
converts, 0
the 0
Lord 0
forgives, 0
and 0
when 0
the 0
Lord 0
forgives, 0
the 0
Lord 0
forgets 0
and 0
this 0
is 0
very 0
important 0
for 0
our 0
lives. 0

When 0
we 0
confess 0
our 0
sins 0
and 0
we 0
truly 0
say, 0
“I 0
have 0
sinned 0
in 0
this”, 0
the 0
Lord 0
forgets, 0
and 0
so 0
we 0
have 0
no 0
right 0
not 0
to 0
forget, 0
because 0
otherwise 0
we 0
would 0
run 0
the 0
risk 0
of 0
the 0
Lord 0
not 0
forgetting 0
our 0
sins. 0

That 1
is 1
a 1
danger. 1

This 0

is 0
important: 0
a 0
theology 0
of 0
sin. 0

Many 0
times 0
I 0
think 0
of 0
Saint 0
Peter. 0

He 0
committed 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
worst 0
sins, 0
that 0
is 0
he 0
denied 0
Christ, 0
and 0
even 0
with 0
this 0
sin 0
they 0
made 0
him 0
Pope. 0

We 0
have 0
to 0
think 0
a 0
great 0
deal 0
about 0
that. 0

But, 0

returning 0
to 0
your 0
question 0
more 0
concretely. 0

In 0
this 0
case, 0
I 0
conducted 0
the 0
preliminary 0
investigation 0
and 0
we 0
didn’t 0
find 0
anything. 0

This 0
is 0
the 0
first 0
question. 0

Then, 0
you 0
spoke 0
about 0
the 0
gay 0
lobby. 0

So 0
much 0
is 0
written 0
about 0
the 0
gay 0
lobby. 0

I 0
still 0
haven’t 0
found 0
anyone 0
with 0
an 0
identity 0
card 0
in 0
the 0
Vatican 0
with 0
“gay” 0
on 0
it. 0

They 0
say 0
there 0
are 0
some 0
there. 0

I 0

believe 0
that 0
when 0
you 0
are 0
dealing 0
with 0
such 0
a 0
person, 0
you 0
must 0
distinguish 0
between 0
the 0
fact 0
of 0
a 0
person 0
being 0
gay 0
and 0
the 0
fact 0
of 0
someone 0
forming 0
a 0
lobby, 0
because 0
not 0
all 0
lobbies 0
are 0
good. 0

This 0
one 0
is 0
not 0
good. 0

If 0

someone 0
is 0
gay 0
and 0
is 0
searching 0
for 0
the 0
Lord 0
and 0
has 0
good 0
will, 0
then 0
who 1
am 1
I 1
to 1
judge 1
him? 1

The 0
Catechism 0
of 0
the 0
Catholic 0
Church 0
explains 0
this 0
in 0
a 0
beautiful 0
way, 0
saying 0
... 0
wait 0
a 0
moment, 0
how 0
does 0
it 0
say 0
it 0
... 0
it 0
says: 0
“no 0
one 0
should 0
marginalize 0
these 0
people 0
for 0
this, 0
they 0
must 0
be 0
integrated 0
into 0
society”. 0

The 0
problem 0
is 0
not 0
having 0
this 0
tendency, 0
no, 0
we 0
must 0
be 0
brothers 0
and 0
sisters 0
to 0
one 0
another, 0
and 0
there 0
is 0
this 0
one 0
and 0
there 0
is 0
that 0
one. 0

The 0
problem 0
is 0
in 0
making 0
a 0
lobby 0
of 0
this 0
tendency: 0
a 0
lobby 0
of 0
misers, 0
a 0
lobby 0
of 0
politicians, 0
a 0
lobby 0
of 0
masons, 0
so 1
many 1
lobbies. 1

For 0
me, 0
this 0
is 0
the 0
greater 0
problem. 0

Thank 0
you 0
so 0
much 0
for 0
asking 0
this 0
question. 0

Many 0
thanks. 0

One 0
of 0
the 0
pope’s 0
favourite 0
rhetorical 0
techniques 0
is 0
a 0
combination 0
of 0
Begging 0
the 0
Question 0
and 0
conspiracy. 0

He 0
starts 0
by 0
assuming, 0
without 0
any 0
effort 0
at 0
defence 0
or 0
explanation, 0
a 0
point 0
that 0
concedes 0
the 0
whole 0
issue. 0

This 0
was 0
the 0
first 0
time 0
a 0
pope 0
had 0
ever 0
used 0
the 0
political 0
term 0
“gay”. 0

Not 0
“homosexual,” 0
not 0
“same-sex 0
attracted,” 0
but 0
“gay,” 0
meaning 0
that 0
he 0
started 0
by 0
adopting 0
the 0
entirety 0
of 0
the 0
homosexualist 0
movement’s 0
linguistic 0
manipulations. 0

Language 0
counts 0
in 0
politics, 0
and 0
a 0
pope 0
using 0
that 0
term 0
means 0
he 0
is 0
by 0
implication 0
starting 0
the 0
discussion 0
– 0
and 0
his 0
pontificate 0
– 0
by 0
aligning 0
himself 0
with 0
the 0
basic 0
tenets 0
of 0
a 0
movement 0
that 0
is 0
violently 1
opposed 1
to 0
Catholic 0
moral 0
teaching, 0
and 0
in 0
direct 0
opposition 0
to 0
his 0
immediate, 0
and 0
still 0
living, 0
predecessor. 0

In 0
this 0
case 0
too, 0
he 0
was 0
addressing 0
a 0
plane 0
load 0
of 0
journalists 0
who 0
were 0
either 0
secular 0
themselves, 0
or 0
for 0
the 0
most 0
part 0
are 0
the 0
kind 0
of 0
Catholic 0
who 0
believes 0
it 0
is 0
fine 0
to 0
“disagree” 0
with 0
Catholic 0
teaching 0
on 0
sexuality. 0

There 0
are 0
very 0
few 0
“conservative” 0
Catholics 0
in 0
the 0
Vatican 0
journalist 0
pool. 0

This 0
means 0
that 0
his 0
use 0
of 0
this 0
language 0
was 0
a 0
conspiratorial 0
wink 0
and 0
nod 0
to 0
his 0
immediate 0
audience, 0
a 0
sly 0
message 0
to 0
say, 0
“People 0
talk 0
all 0
the 0
time 0
about 0
a 0
gay 0
lobby, 0
but 0
you 0
and 0
I 0
both 0
know 0
this 0
is 0
mostly 0
nonsense, 1
propaganda 1
from 0
those 0
people… 0
those 0
conservatives…We 0
cool 1
and 1
hip 1
people 1
don’t 1
hate 1
gays, 1
do 1
we?” 1

This 0
astonishing 0
departure 0
follows 0
an 0
implied 0
but 0
very 0
clear 0
assertion 0
that 0
Ricca 0
has 0
repented 0
and 0
given 0
up 0
his 0
activity, 0
an 0
assertion 0
that 0
has 0
absolutely 0
no 0
evidence 0
to 0
back 0
it 0
up. 0

We 1
are 1
simply 1
asked 1
to 1
take 1
the 1
pope’s 1
word 1
for 1
it, 1
but 0
given 0
that 0
it 0
follows 0
his 0
astoundingly 1
brazen 1
lie 1
that 0
there 0
was 0
no 0
evidence 0
for 0
Ricca’s 0
homosexual 0
activity 0
in 0
the 0
first 0
place, 0
we 0
can 0
take 0
the 0
assurance 0
for 0
what 0
it 0
seems 0
to 0
be 0
worth. 0

Next, 0
after 0
another 0
little 0
inside 0
nudge-nudge-wink-wink 1
joke 1
about 0
the 0
“gay 0
lobby” 0
– 0
implying 0
(but 0
of 0
course 0
never 0
outright 0
saying) 0
that 0
the 0
whole 0
thing 0
is 0
hysterical 1
nonsense 1
– 0
we 0
hear 0
a 0
direct 0
contradiction 0
to 0
Catholic 0
teaching 0
from 0
no 0
less 0
a 0
source 0
than 0
his 0
predecessor, 0
Pope 0
Benedict 0
Ratzinger. 0

“The 0
problem 0
is 0
not 0
having 0
this 0
tendency.” 0
Well, 0
actually, 0
your 0
holiness, 0
yes 0
it 0
is, 0
particularly 0
in 0
the 0
case 0
of 0
priests. 0

The 0
“tendency” 0
is 0
called 0
in 0
the 0
same 0
catechism 0
you 0
quote 0
“intrinsically 1
disordered” 1
and 0
Ratzinger 0
was 0
very 0
clear 0
that 0
this 0
“tendency” 0
is 0
a 0
sign 0
of 0
a 1
serious 1
emotional 1
dysfunction 1
that 1
“must” 1
preclude 1
a 1
man 1
from 1
being 1
ordained. 1

Squandering 1
the 1
capital 1
of 1
trust 1

A 0
few 0
months 0
ago 0
in 0
a 0
piece 0
for 0
the 0
Remnant, 0
I 0
talked 0
about 0
why 0
the 0
Church 0
(and 0
nearly 0
all 0
human 0
societies) 0
regard 0
lying 0
as 0
a 0
sin: 0

A 0
mistake 0
many 0
make 0
about 0
lying 0
is 0
to 0
understand 0
it 0
only 0
in 0
terms 0
of 0
morality. 0

But 0
Thomas 0
makes 0
the 0
point 0
that 0
it 0
is 0
first 0
a 0
matter 0
of 0
metaphysics. 0

Lying 0
is 0
an 0
act 0
at 0
variance 0
in 0
its 0
essence 0
with 0
the 0
nature 0
of 0
reality. 0

Thomistic 0
theology 0
teaches 0
that 0
it 0
is 0
by 0
lying 0
that 0
we 0
become 0
most 0
like 0
the 0
devil, 0
and 0
most 0
unlike 0
God, 0
because 0
we 0
are 0
trying 0
to 0
change 0
the 0
nature 0
of 0
reality 0
to 0
suit 0
our 0
own 0
purposes. 0

Habitual 0
lying 0
in 0
effect 0
changes 0
you 0
into 0
a 0
different 0
kind 0
of 0
being, 0
one 0
that 0
is 0
by 0
nature 0
an 0
opponent 0
of 0
Truth, 0
ordered 0
against 0
Truth. 0

This 0
of 0
course 0
means 0
that 0
a 0
person 0
whose 0
“orientation,” 0
as 0
we 0
might 0
say, 0
is 0
towards 0
falsehood, 0
even 0
when 0
he 0
is 0
at 0
any 0
given 0
moment 0
saying 0
something 0
true, 0
is 0
still 0
servicing 0
his 0
lies. 0

He 0
tells 0
the 0
truth 0
only 0
to 0
continue 0
to 0
control 0
and 0
manipulate 0
reality. 0

It 0
was 0
not 0
by 0
violence, 0
but 0
by 0
lying 0
and 0
manipulation, 0
by 0
issuing 0
half-truths 0
and 0
pretending 0
to 0
be 0
the 0
kind 0
of 0
man 0
he 0
was 0
not, 0
that 0
Shakespeare’s 0
character 0
Iago 0
earned 0
the 0
title 0
of 0
most 0
evil 0
character 0
in 0
English 0
literature. 0

Human 0
beings 0
are 0
naturally 0
ordered 0
towards 0
the 0
truth, 0
and 0
we 0
have 0
to 0
work 0
at 0
assuming 0
a 0
lie. 0

This 0
is 0
why 0
confidence 0
tricksters 0
can 0
be 0
successful, 0
why 0
lying 0
works 0
for 0
getting 0
what 0
you 0
want; 0
people 0
don’t 0
see 0
it 0
coming. 0

The 0
first 0
natural 0
assumption 0
is 0
trust, 0
at 0
least 0
at 0
the 0
basic 0
level 0
of 0
expecting 0
truth 0
most 0
of 0
the 0
time. 0

We 0
therefore 0
instinctively 0
see 0
lying 0
as 0
a 0
betrayal 0
of 0
trust. 0

Considering 0
how 0
much 0
trust 0
the 0
Catholic 0
faithful 0
had 0
in 0
the 0
papacy 0
until 0
about 0
1965, 0
how 0
much 0
un-earned 0
trust 0
Francis 0
started 0
with 0
just 0
by 0
being 0
elected, 0
this 0
pontificate 0
should 0
be 0
remembered 0
as 0
one 1
of 1
the 1
great 1
confidence 1
scams 1
in 0
history. 0

Believing 0
Catholics 0
have 0
watched 1
aghast 1
as 0
this 0
pope 0
has 0
habitually 0
trampled 0
on 0
every 0
aspect 0
of 0
Catholic 0
teaching. 0

Sandro 0
Magister 0
recently 0
published 0
a 0
piece 0
on 0
his 0
website 0
that 0
listed 0
in 0
dizzying 1
detail 1
the 0
many 0
times, 0
in 0
only 0
the 0
last 0
few 0
months, 0
that 0
pope 0
Francis 0
has 0
falsified 0
with 0
obvious 0
intention, 0
the 0
words 0
of 0
Christ 0
in 0
Scripture 0
and 0
the 0
teaching 0
of 0
the 0
Church. 0

Of 0
course 0
this 0
would 0
be 0
of 0
little 0
interest 0
to 0
secular 1
journalists, 1
who 0
have 0
paid 0
no 0
mind 0
to 0
his 0
habit 0
of 0
rewriting 0
Catholicism, 0
but 0
the 0
sex 0
abuse 0
crisis 0
is 0
something 0
secular 1
journalists 1
are 0
very 0
interested 0
in, 0
a 0
fact 0
Bergoglio 0
seems 0
not 0
to 0
have 0
understood. 0

It 0
is 0
now 0
irrefutable 0
that 0
Pope 0
Bergoglio 0
is 0
a 0
habitual 1
liar 1
– 0
that 0
in 0
fact 0
truth, 0
like 0
reality, 0
seems 0
to 0
mean 0
nothing 0
to 0
him 0
except 0
as 0
a 0
tool. 0

Sociologists 0
talk 0
about 0
the 0
concept 0
of 0
the 0
“high 0
trust 0
society,” 0
one 0
in 0
which 0
citizens 0
believe 0
what 0
they 0
are 0
told 0
by 0
the 0
elites 0
and 0
trust 0
them 0
to 0
govern 0
and 0
protect 0
them 0
adequately. 0

They 1
warn 1
that 1
the 1
general 1
loss 1
of 1
trust 1
in 1
institutions 1
leads 1
to 1
a 1
general 1
state 1
of 1
chaos, 1
in 1
which 1
laws 1
on 1
the 1
books 1
matter 1
little 1
as 1
citizens 1
turn 1
to 1
their 1
last 1
resort 1
of 1
protecting 1
themselves 1
and 1
their 1
own 1
families. 1

This 0
is 0
the 0
way 0
societies 0
disintegrate. 0

It 0
has 0
been 0
said 0
many 0
times 0
that 0
the 0
sex 0
abuse 0
crisis 0
has 0
created 0
a 0
massive 0
loss 0
of 0
trust 0
in 0
prelates 0
among 0
the 0
Catholic 0
faithful, 0
and 0
this 0
is 0
true. 0

With 0
a 0
professional 1
confidence 1
trickster 1
on 0
the 0
papal 0
throne, 0
blatantly 1
using 1
lies 1
and 1
manipulation 1
to 0
maintain 0
power 0
and 0
ram 0
through 0
an 0
agenda 0
at 0
radical 0
variance 0
with 0
Catholic 0
doctrine, 0
how 0
long 0
before 0
that 0
predictable 0
disintegration 0
occurs? 0

Are 0
we 0
seeing 0
it 0
already? 0

Are 0
we 0
seeing 0
it 0
in 0
the 0
declarations 0
of 0
this 0
or 0
that 0
episcopate 0
on 0
Amoris 0
Laetitia 0
and 0
Communion 0
for 0
divorced 0
and 0
civilly 0
remarried 0
Catholics? 0

With 0
Cardinal 0
Marx 0
and 0
others 0
promoting 0
“blessings” 0
for 0
“same-sex 0
unions” 0
are 0
we 0
going 0
to 0
be 0
seeing 0
an 0
escalation 0
of 0
it? 0

I 0
have 0
seen 0
a 0
veritable 0
chorus 0
of 0
Catholics 0
on 0
social 0
media 0
declaring 0
that 0
if 1
Paul 1
VI 1
is 1
canonised, 1
their 1
loss 1
of 1
faith 1
in 1
the 1
Church 1
as 1
an 1
institution 1
will 1
be 1
complete. 1

I 0
am 0
told 0
from 0
contacts 0
inside 0
the 0
Vatican 0
that 0
after 0
the 0
trip 0
to 0
Chile 0
Bergoglio’s 0
support 0
has 0
completely 0
dried 0
up. 0

He 0
has 0
no 0
more 0
resources 0
of 0
trust 0
even 0
among 0
the 0
people 0
he 0
has 0
chosen 0
to 0
surround 0
himself 0
with 0
and 0
after 0
the 0
reports 0
of 0
Cardinal 0
Sandri 0
going 0
toe-to-toe 0
with 0
him 0
in 0
a 0
shouting 1
match, 1
it 0
seems 0
that 0
perhaps 0
even 0
his 0
legendary 0
vicious 1
temper 1
tantrums 1
are 0
failing 0
to 0
have 0
the 0
desired 0
effect 0
of 0
terrorising 1
his 1
subordinates 1
into 1
submission. 1

Marie 0
Collins, 0
by 0
no 0
stretch 0
even 0
a 0
“conservative” 0
Catholic, 0
echoed 0
this 0
concern, 0
saying 0
the 0
Barros 0
affair 0
has 0
“definitely 0
undermined 0
credibility, 0
trust, 0
and 0
hope” 0
in 0
Francis. 0

“All 0
I 0
can 0
say 0
is 0
that 0
people 0
who 0
had 0
a 0
lot 0
of 0
hope 0
in 0
this 0
particular 0
pope, 0
and 0
I 0
am 0
talking 0
about 0
just 0
ordinary 0
Catholics 0
that 0
I 0
know 0
in 0
my 0
own 0
parish, 0
would 0
find 0
it 0
very 0
difficult 0
now…and 0
cannot 0
understand 0
and 0
cannot 0
believe 0
that 0
this 0
particular 0
pope 0
has 0
said 0
the 0
things 0
he 0
has 0
said 0
in 0
the 0
last 0
few 0
weeks,” 0
she 0
told 0
the 0
National 0
Catholic 0
Reporter. 0

It 0
may 0
seem 0
like 0
a 0
moment 0
to 0
enjoy, 0
seeing 0
the 0
apparently 1
unbreachable 1
shell 1
of 1
papal 1
teflon 1
finally 0
cracking, 0
but 0
in 0
reality 0
this 0
situation 0
is 0
potentially 0
very 0
harmful 0
for 0
souls 0
in 0
the 0
long 0
run. 0

There 0
is 0
a 0
multitude 0
of 0
problems 0
this 0
pontificate 0
has 0
created 0
or 0
made 0
worse 0
that 0
we 0
will 0
be 0
dealing 0
with 0
for 0
a 0
long 0
time 0
after 0
Bergoglio 0
is 0
gone, 0
but 0
perhaps 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
bigger 0
ones 0
will 0
be 0
the 0
destruction 0
of 0
trust. 0

Already 0
fractured 0
since 0
the 0
collapse 0
of 0
all 0
Catholic 0
institutions 0
after 0
Vatican 0
II 0
and 0
the 0
horrors 1
of 0
the 0
sex 0
abuse 0
crisis, 0
how 0
much 0
will 0
there 0
be 0
to 0
repair 0
of 0
the 0
once-steadfast 0
trust 0
Catholics 0
instinctively 0
had 0
in 0
the 0
Church 0
after 0
this? 0

Notes: 0

[1] 0
“Not 0
one 0
victim 0
has 0
come 0
forward 0
in 0
Chile; 0
show 0
me 0
the 0
proof. 0

This 0
is 0
slander 1
and 1
calumny. 1

Is 0
that 0
clear?” 0

[2] 0
The 0
book 0
“The 0
Dictator 0
Pope” 0
relates 0
that 0
regular 0
meetings 0
between 0
the 0
pope 0
and 0
dicastery 0
heads 0
have 0
been 0
abolished 0
and 0
even 0
high-ranking 0
curia 0
prefects 0
are 0
often 0
unable 0
to 0
see 0
the 0
pope, 0
whose 0
appointments 0
are 0
now 0
completely 0
controlled 0
by 0
the 0
Secretariat 0
of 0
State. 0

It 0
is 0
certainly 0
clear 0
that 0
no 0
one 0
sees 0
the 0
pope 0
unless 0
Cardinal 0
Parolin 0
approves, 0
which 0
may 0
be 0
the 0
reason 0
Cardinal 0
Zen, 0
in 0
his 0
efforts 0
to 0
warn 0
Francis 0
of 0
the 0
dangers 0
of 0
a 0
Vatican 0
deal 0
with 0
the 0
communist 0
Chinese 0
government 0
had 0
to 0
wait 0
in 0
the 0
rain 0
at 0
a 0
Wednesday 0
general 0
audience. 0

[3] 0
This 0
is 0
common 0
in 0
Italian 0
journalism 0
that 0
has 0
somewhat 0
different 0
standards 0
from 0
that 0
of 0
the 0
Anglo 0
world… 0
and 0
drives 0
the 0
rest 0
of 0
us 0
spare. 0

Italians 0
care 0
about 0
getting 0
a 0
general 0
picture 0
of 0
what’s 0
going 0
on, 0
where 0
Anglo-Saxons 0
are 0
considered 0
weirdly 0
obsessed 0
with 0
trivial 0
details. 0

[4] 0
Though 0
she 0
never 0
blamed 0
the 0
pope, 0
Marie 0
Collins 0
complained 0
that 0
Vatican 0
officialdom 0
had 0
simply 0
not 0
implemented 0
the 0
Commission’s 0
recommendations. 0

The 0
time 0
limit 0
of 0
the 0
Commission’s 0
members 0
was 0
allowed 0
to 0
lapse 0
without 0
renewal 0
and 0
though 0
it 0
was 0
not 0
dissolved 0
formally 0
the 0
Commission 0
has 0
ceased 0
to 0
function 0
with 0
no 0
word 0
of 0
any 0
plan 0
to 0
revive 0
it. 0

[5] 0
Probably 0
a 0
reference 0
to 0
the 0
Inzoli 0
case 0
in 0
which 0
Francis 0
overturned 0
a 0
previous 0
sentence 0
of 0
a 0
Vatican 0
tribunal 0
after 0
the 0
priest 0
– 0
now 0
laicised 0
– 0
approached 0
some 0
of 0
the 0
pope’s 0
close 0
advisors 0
for 0
help, 0
including 0
Cardinal 0
Coccopalmerio. 0

[6] 0
Not 1

Sandro 0
Magister 0
reported 0
after 0
the 0
“Who 0
am 0
I 0
to 0
judge” 0
comment, 0
“Before 0
the 0
appointment, 0
Francis 0
had 0
been 0
shown, 0
as 0
is 0
customary, 0
the 0
personal 0
file 0
on 0
Ricca, 0
in 0
which 0
he 0
had 0
not 0
found 0
anything 0
unseemly. 0

He 0
had 0
also 0
heard 0
from 0
various 0
personalities 0
of 0
the 0
curia, 0
and 0
none 0
of 0
