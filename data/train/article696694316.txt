Eucharist 0

Pope 0
Paul 0
VI’s 0
1965 0
encyclical 0
on 0
the 0
Eucharist, 0
“Mysterium 0
Fidei,” 0
was 0
the 0
first 0
place 0
I 0
saw 0
anyone 0
say 0
that 0
the 0
body 0
and 0
blood, 0
soul 0
and 0
complete 0
divinity 0
of 0
Christ 0
was 0
actually 0
present 0
in 0
the 0
consecrated 0
species. 0

Having 0
been 0
raised 0
in 0
Remi 0
de 0
Roo’s 0
Victoria 0
in 0
the 0
1970s, 0
I 0
had 0
naturally 0
never 0
heard 0
anything 0
at 0
all 0
about 0
the 0
Eucharist. 0

The 0
understanding 0
that 0
Catholics 0
believed 0
what 0
they 0
believe 0
about 0
it 0
came 0
as 0
a 0
bit 0
of 0
a 0
shock. 0

(Read 0
the 0
full 0
document 0

) 0

With 0
the 0
hindsight 0
of 0
52 0
years 0
and 0
a 0
great 0
deal 0
of 0
very 1
dirty 1
and 1
unappealing 1
water 1
under 1
the 1
Catholic 1
bridge, 1
we 0
can 0
see 0
it 0
as 0
a 0
kind 0
of 0
warning 0
prophecy. 0

Published 0
just 0
three 0
months 0
before 0
the 0
close 0
of 0
Vatican 0
II 0
and 0
just 0
as 0
Annibale 0
Bugnini 0
was 0
cranking 0
open 0
the 0
floodgates 0
of 0
his 0
never-ending 0
stream 0
of 0
liturgical 0
alterations, 0
Mysterium 0
Fidei 0
is 0
now 0
an 0
important 0
marker 0
of 0
a 0
critical 0
turning 0
point 0
in 0
Catholic 0
history, 0
perhaps 0
the 0
most 0
important 0
of 0
modern 0
times. 0

Who 1

can 1
read 1
this 1
without 1
cringing 1
at 1
what 1
we 1
now 1
know 1
was 1
about 1
to 1
happen: 1

Therefore, 0
we 0
earnestly 0
hope 0
that 0
the 0
restored 0
sacred 0
liturgy 0
will 0
bring 0
forth 0
abundant 0
fruits 0
of 0
eucharistic 0
devotion, 0
so 0
that 0
the 0
Holy 0
Church, 0
under 0
this 0
saving 0
sign 0
of 0
piety, 0
may 0
make 0
daily 0
progress 0
toward 0
perfect 0
unity 0
and 0
may 0
invite 0
all 0
Christians 0
to 0
a 0
unity 0
of 0
faith 0
and 0
of 0
love, 0
drawing 0
them 0
gently, 0
thanks 0
to 0
the 0
action 0
of 0
divine 0
grace. 0

But 0
in 0
1983 0
at 0
the 0
start 0
of 0
my 0
personal 0
investigations 0
into 0
the 0
Catholic 0
religion, 0
I 0
knew 0
nothing 0
of 0
any 0
of 0
that. 0

The 0
encyclical, 0
the 0
very 0
first 0
I 0
ever 0
read, 0
was 0
also 0
a 0
marker 0
for 0
me 0
of 0
a 0
personal 0
turning 0
point. 0

It 0
was 0
the 0
first 0
time 0
I 0
had 0
ever 0
seen 0
Catholic 0
eucharistic 0
doctrine 0
clearly 0
and 0
– 0
most 0
importantly 0
– 0
unapologetically 0
stated. 0

It 0
came 0
right 0
out 0
and 0
said 0
something 0
so 0
astounding, 0
something 0
so 0
completely 0
unlikely, 0
that 0
I 0
had 0
to 0
admit 0
that 0
it 0
left 0
very 0
few 0
logical 0
possibilities. 0

Like 0
C.S. 0

Lewis’s 0
assessment 0
of 0
the 0
claims 0
by 0
Christ 0
of 0
His 0
own 0
divinity, 0
this 0
pope 0
was 0
either 0
mad, 0
bad 0
or 0
telling 0
the 0
plain 0
truth. 0

Something 0

that 0
may 0
be 0
much 0
more 0
noteworthy 0
now 0
in 0
our 0
current 0
circumstances 0
than 0
it 0
was 0
the 0
year 0
I 0
read 0
it, 0
is 0
that 0
the 0
pope’s 0
very 0
first 0
quote 0
was 0
not 0
of 0
scripture, 0
but 0
the 0
Council 0
of 0
Trent: 0

“At 0
the 0
Last 0
Supper, 0
on 0
the 0
night 0
He 0
was 0
handed 0
over, 0
Our 0
Lord 0
instituted 0
the 0
Eucharistic 0
Sacrifice 0
of 0
His 0
Body 0
and 0
Blood, 0
to 0
perpetuate 0
the 0
sacrifice 0
of 0
the 0
cross 0
throughout 0
the 0
ages 0
until 0
He 0
should 0
come, 0
and 0
thus 0
entrust 0
to 0
the 0
Church, 0
His 0
beloved 0
spouse, 0
the 0
memorial 0
of 0
His 0
death 0
and 0
resurrection: 0
a 0
sacrament 0
of 0
devotion, 0
a 0
sign 0
of 0
unity, 0
a 0
bond 0
of 0
charity, 0
a 0
paschal 0
banquet 0
in 0
which 0
Christ 0
is 0
received, 0
the 0
soul 0
is 0
filled 0
with 0
grace 0
and 0
there 0
is 0
given 0
to 0
us 0
the 0
pledge 0
of 0
future 0
glory.” 0

In 0

these 0
words 0
are 0
highlighted 0
both 0
the 0
sacrifice, 0
which 0
pertains 0
to 0
the 0
essence 0
of 0
the 0
Mass 0
which 0
is 0
celebrated 0
daily, 0
and 0
the 0
sacrament 0
in 0
which 0
the 0
faithful 0
participate 0
in 0
Holy 0
Communion 0
by 0
eating 0
the 0
Flesh 0
of 0
Christ 0
and 0
drinking 0
His 0
Blood, 0
receiving 0
both 0
grace, 0
the 0
beginning 0
of 0
eternal 0
life, 0
and 0
the 0
medicine 0
of 0
immortality. 0

I 0
remember 0
my 0
thoughts 0
upon 0
reading 0
this 0
shocking 0
statement… 0
“By 0
doing 0
what? 0

!” 0

My 0

acceptance 0
from 0
the 0
reading 0
of 0
this 0
document 0
of 0
the 0
Church’s 0
orthodox 0
eucharistic 0
doctrine 0
was 0
based 0
in 0
part 0
on 0
Pope 1
Paul’s 1
gracious 1
and 1
beautiful 1
exposition, 1
and 1
in 1
part 1
on 1
the 1
sheer 1
radical, 1
mad 1
unlikeliness 1
of 1
it. 1

What 0
could 0
conceivably 0
be 0
the 0
reason 0
to 0
say 0
anything 0
as 0
wild 0
as 0
this 0
if 0
it 0
weren’t 0
true? 0

The 1

idea 1
of 1
transubstantiation 1
struck 1
me 1
as 1
I 1
read 1
that 1
document 1
as 1
possibly 1
the 1
strangest 1
and 1
most 1
earth 1
shattering 1
thing 1
I’d 1
ever 1
heard. 1

It 1
shocked 1
me 1
out 1
of 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
swamp 1
of 1
intellectual 1
worldliness; 1
presenting 1
the 1
idea 1
to 1
my 1
thirsty 1
mind 1
that 1
there 1
could 1
indeed 1
be 1
fantastic 1
realities 1
far 1
more 1
wonderful 1
than 1
the 1
banal 1
and 1
painfully 1
uninteresting 1
secularist 1
worldview 1
I 1
had 1
been 1
taught 1
to 1
accept. 1

It 1
was 1
as 1
though 1
someone 1
had 1
plausibly 1
told 1
me 1
that, 1
yes, 1
there 1
were 1
fairies 1
and 1
magical 1
kingdoms 1
in 1
real 1
life, 1
“just 1
around 1
the 1
corner”. 1

By 0

the 0
time 0
I 0
read 0
it, 0
I 0
had 0
been 0
through 0
a 0
long, 0
slow 0
transition 0
from 0
a 0
childhood 0
devoted 0
to 0
Our 0
Lady 0
and 0
confirmed 0
in 0
my 0
belief 0
in 0
wonders, 0
to 0
a 0
kind 0
of 0
disappointed 0
practical 0
atheism 0
after 0
three 0
years 0
in 0
a 0
diocesan 0
Catholic 0
parochial 0
school. 0

I 0
had 0
been 0
taught, 0
by 0
both 0
word 0
and 0
implication, 0
that 0
everything 0
the 0
Catholic 0
Church 0
had 0
taught 0
before 0
Vatican 0
II 0
was 0
pernicious 1
nonsense. 1

Where 0
it 0
was 0
simply 0
wrong 0
it 0
was 0
ridiculous 0
and 0
where 0
it 0
was 0
wrong 0
and 0
political 0
it 1
was 1
outright 1
wicked. 1

What 0

led 0
me 0
to 0
read 0
that 0
particular 0
encyclical 0
is 0
the 0
most 0
clearly 0
identifiable 0
moment 0
of 0
actual 0
grace 0
in 0
my 0
young 0
life 0
to 0
that 0
point. 0

It 0
was 0
the 0
first 0
time 0
it 0
occurred 0
to 0
me 0
to 0
investigate, 0
like 0
an 0
anthropologist, 0
what 0
the 0
Church 0
herself 0
said 0
about 0
her 0
teachings. 0

While 0
mulling 0
grimly 0
one 0
day 0
over 0
all 0
the 0
wickedness 0
of 0
the 0
Catholic 0
Church, 0
I 0
was 0
pulled 0
up 0
short 0
by 0
a 0
single 0
thought: 0
“I 0
could 0
be 0
wrong.” 0
At 0
17 0
it 0
seemed 0
such 0
an 0
unlikely 0
thing 0
to 0
think 0
I 0
was 0
rather 0
shocked. 0

But 0
stopping 0
a 0
moment 0
to 0
consider, 0
I 0
realised 0
that 0
I 0
had 0
only 0
ever 0
heard 0
about 0
Catholic 0
things 0
from 0
people 0
who 0
clearly 0
hated 0
the 0
Church; 0
her 0
enemies, 0
in 0
short. 0

It 0
hardly 0
seemed 0
just 0
to 0
convict 0
on 0
the 0
testimony 0
of 0
these 0
obviously 0
biased 0
witnesses. 0

In 0
order 0
to 0
properly 0
and 0
thoroughly 0
condemn 0
the 0
Church, 0
with 0
convincing 0
due 0
diligence, 0
I 0
had 0
to 0
read 0
something 0
about 0
it 0
that 0
didn’t 0
come 0
from 0
her 0
enemies. 0

The 0

same 0
day, 0
I 0
presented 0
myself 0
at 0
the 0
reference 0
desk 0
of 0
the 0
public 0
library 0
and 0
asked, 0
“Do 0
you 0
have 0
any 0
books 0
about 0
Catholicism? 0

Something 0
official?” 0
The 0
librarian 0
took 0
me 0
to 0
the 0
reference 0
section 0
and 0
showed 0
me 0
the 0
shelves 0
of 0
encyclicals, 0
documents 0
and 0
histories. 0

Saints 0
and 0
popes 0
from 0
one 0
end 0
of 0
the 0
stacks 0
to 0
the 0
other. 0

Having 0
no 0
clear 0
idea 0
what 0
my 0
own 0
question 0
meant, 0
I 0
just 0
picked 0
one 0
at 0
random. 0

The 0

description 0
of 0
the 0
Holy 0
Eucharist 0
as 0
the 0
supreme 0
Centre 0
from 0
which 0
all 0
our 0
life 0
as 0
Catholics 0
flow, 0
and 0
from 0
which 0
all 0
other 0
doctrines 0
radiated, 0
was 0
something 0
that 0
was 0
not 0
going 0
to 0
come 0
into 0
my 0
head 0
for 0
another 0
eight 0
years 0
of 0
reading. 0

But 0
even 0
so, 0
Mysterium 0
Fidei 0
forced 0
me 0
to 0
face 0
up 0
to 0
a 0
reality 0
I’d 0
never 0
dreamed 0
of 0
before; 0
that 0
this, 0
the 0
little 0
unassuming 0
wafer, 0
was 0
the 0
most 0
important 0
thing 0
in 0
the 0
world. 0

Reading 0

through 0
the 0
encyclical 0
again, 0
holding 0
it 0
up 0
next 0
to 0
the 0
current 0
situation 0
in 0
Rome, 0
makes 0
it 0
easier 0
to 0
clarify 0
certain 0
critical 0
issues. 0

Given 0
what 0
we 0
are 0
now 0
seeing, 0
consider 0
the 0
poignancy 0
of 0
the 0
following 0
passages: 0

When 0
dealing 0
with 0
the 0
restoration 0
of 0
the 0
sacred 0
liturgy, 0
the 0
Fathers 0
of 0
the 0
council, 0
by 0
reason 0
of 0
their 0
pastoral 0
concern 0
for 0
the 0
whole 0
Church, 0
considered 0
it 0
of 0
the 0
highest 0
importance 0
to 0
exhort 0
the 0
faithful 0
to 0
participate 0
actively 0
with 0
sound 0
faith 0
and 0
with 0
the 0
utmost 0
devotion 0
in 0
the 0
celebration 0
of 0
this 0
Most 0
Holy 0
Mystery, 0
to 0
offer 0
it 0
with 0
the 0
priest 0
to 0
God 0
as 0
a 0
sacrifice 0
for 0
their 0
own 0
salvation 0
and 0
for 0
that 0
of 0
the 0
whole 0
world, 0
and 0
to 0
find 0
in 0
it 0
spiritual 0
nourishment. 0

This 0
was, 0
remember, 0
1965, 0
four 0
years 0
before 0
the 0
New 0
Mass 0
was 0
issued 0
and 0
before 0
Cardinal 0
Ottaviani 0
warned 0
the 0
pope 0
that 0
it 0
was 0
precisely 0
this 1
sacramental 1
reality 1
that 1
was 1
about 1
to 1
be 1
catastrophically 1
obscured. 1

Who, 0

reading 0
this 0
passage, 0
does 0
not 0
feel 0
the 0
urge 0
to 0
shout 0
down 0
the 0
years, 0
to 0
do 0
something 0
to 0
stave 0
off 0
the 0
disaster 0
that 0
was 0
coming: 0

[W]e 0
are 0
aware 0
of 0
the 0
fact 0
that, 0
among 0
those 0
who 0
deal 0
with 0
this 0
Most 0
Holy 0
Mystery 0
in 0
written 0
or 0
spoken 0
word, 0
there 0
are 0
some 0
who 0
with 0
reference 0
either 0
to 0
Masses 0
which 0
are 0
celebrated 0
in 0
private, 0
or 0
to 0
the 0
dogma 0
of 0
transubstantiation, 0
or 0
to 0
devotion 0
to 0
the 0
Eucharist, 0
spread 0
abroad 0
opinions 0
which 0
disturb 0
the 0
faithful 0
and 0
fill 0
their 0
minds 0
with 0
no 0
little 0
confusion 0
about 0
matters 0
of 0
faith. 0

It 0
is 0
as 0
if 0
everyone 0
were 0
permitted 0
to 0
consign 0
to 0
oblivion 0
doctrine 0
already 0
defined 0
by 0
the 0
Church, 0
or 0
else 0
to 0
interpret 0
it 0
in 0
such 0
a 0
way 0
as 0
to 0
weaken 0
the 0
genuine 0
meaning 0
of 0
the 0
words 0
or 0
the 0
recognized 0
force 0
of 0
the 0
concepts 0
involved. 0

Keeping 0
Cardinal 0
Ottaviani’s 0
Intervention 0
directly 0
before 0
our 0
thoughts, 0
we 0
read 0
with 0
a 0
strange 0
kind 0
of 0
helpless 0
dread… 0

…it 1
is 1
not 1
allowable 1
to 1
emphasize 1
what 1
is 1
called 1
the 1
“communal” 1
Mass 1
to 1
the 1
disparagement 1
of 1
Masses 1
celebrated 1
in 1
private, 1
or 1
to 1
exaggerate 1
the 1
element 1
of 1
sacramental 1
sign 1
as 1
if 1
the 1
symbolism, 1
which 1
all 1
certainly 1
admit 1
in 1
the 1
Eucharist, 1
expresses 1
fully 1
and 1
exhausts 1
completely 1
the 1
mode 1
of 1
Christ’s 1
presence 1
in 1
this 1
sacrament. 1

Nor 1

is 1
it 1
allowable 1
to 1
discuss 1
the 1
mystery 1
of 1
transubstantiation 1
without 1
mentioning 1
what 1
the 1
Council 1
of 1
Trent 1
stated 1
about 1
the 1
marvelous 1
conversion 1
of 1
the 1
whole 1
substance 1
of 1
the 1
bread 1
into 1
the 1
Body 1
and 1
of 1
the 1
whole 1
substance 1
of 1
the 1
wine 1
into 1
the 1
Blood 1
of 1
Christ, 1
speaking 1
rather 1
only 1
of 1
what 1
is 1
called 1
“transignification” 1
and 1
“transfiguration,” 1
or 0
finally 0
to 0
propose 0
and 0
act 0
upon 0
the 0
opinion 0
according 0
to 0
which, 0
in 0
the 0
Consecrated 0
Hosts 0
which 0
remain 0
after 0
the 0
celebration 0
of 0
the 0
sacrifice 0
of 0
the 0
Mass, 0
Christ 0
Our 0
Lord 0
is 0
no 0
longer 0
present. 0

[…] 0

And 0

therefore, 0
so 0
that 0
the 0
hope 0
aroused 0
by 0
the 0
council, 0
that 0
a 0
flourishing 0
of 0
eucharistic 0
piety 0
which 0
is 0
now 0
pervading 0
the 0
whole 0
Church, 0
be 0
not 0
frustrated 0
by 0
this 0
spread 0
of 0
false 0
opinions, 0
we 0
have 0
with 0
apostolic 0
authority 0
decided 0
to 0
address 0
you, 0
venerable 0
brothers, 0
and 0
to 0
express 0
our 0
mind 0
on 0
this 0
subject. 0

jeremiads 0
now 0
have 0
been 0
working 0
to 0
clarify 0
that 0
the 0
attack 0
from 0
Rome 0
on 0
the 0
moral 0
doctrine 0
of 0
the 0
Church 0
isn’t 0
about 0
marriage. 0

It’s 0
about 0
the 0
Eucharist 0
and 0
to 0
a 0
lesser 0
extent 0
the 0
priesthood. 0

The 1
demonic 1
forces 1
we 1
know 1
are 1
the 1
driving 1
force 1
behind 1
this 1
supreme 1
moment 1
of 1
heresy 1
and 1
destruction 1
aren’t 1
really 1
looking 1
at 1
the 1
undermining 1
of 1
marriage 1
as 1
their 1
primary 1
goal; 1
they 1
want 1
to 1
get 1
at 1
the 1
Eucharist. 1

We 1
know 1
it 1
is 1
demonically 1
inspired 1
because 1
their 1
hatred 1
is 1
for 1
Christ 1
Himself 1
in 1
the 1
first 1
place 1
and 1
for 1
anyone 1
who 1
loves 1
and 1
wants 1
to 1
serve 1
Him 1
second. 1

They 1
are 1
men 1
who 1
refuse 1
to 1
bend 1
the 1
knee 1
before 1
the 1
God 1
whom 1
they 1
will 1
not 1
serve. 1

This 0

knowledge 0
– 0
that 0
the 0
attack 0
is 0
on 0
the 0
Body 0
and 0
Blood 0
of 0
Christ 0
– 0
can 0
also 0
help 0
readers 0
spot 0
their 0
friends 0
in 0
the 0
crowd. 0

The 0
places 0
where 0
Eucharistic 0
adoration 0
is 0
still 0
offered 0
are 0
places 0
where 0
at 0
least 0
some 0
flicker 0
of 0
the 0
true 0
Faith 0
survives. 0

The 0
bishops 0
and 0
priests 0
now 0
talking 0
about 0
the 0
supreme 0
glory 0
of 0
the 0
Eucharist, 0
and 0
the 0
need 0
to 0
defend 0
it 0
from 0
sacrilege, 0
are 0
lighthouses. 0

A 0
case 0
in 0
point 0
is 0
Bishop 0
Mark 0
Davies, 0
of 0
my 0
own 0
former 0
diocese 0
of 0
Shrewsbury 0
in 0
England. 0

In 0
March, 0
2016, 0
in 0
the 0
midst 0
of 0
the 0
shouting 0
from 0
Rome, 0
Bishop 0
Davies 0
spoke 0
at 0
his 0
Chrism 0
Mass 0
said 0
that 0
only 0
through 0
the 0
“reality 0
of 0
the 0
Eucharist” 0
could 0
new 0
vocations 0
to 0
the 0
priesthood 0
be 0
found. 0

“In 0
treasuring 0
this 0
gift 0
of 0
priestly 0
celibacy 0
we 0
need 0
to 0
recognize 0
more 0
clearly 0
the 0
intimate 0
link 0
between 0
the 0
Ministerial 0
Priesthood 0
and 0
the 0
reality 0
of 0
the 0
Eucharist. 0

If 1
the 1
Mass 1
were 1
ever 1
reduced 1
in 1
our 1
minds 1
to 1
being 1
merely 1
a 1
commemorative 1
meal 1
and 1
the 1
priest 1
as 1
only 1
a 1
community 1
leader 1
or 1
functionary, 1
then 1
the 1
celibacy 1
of 1
the 1
Catholic 1
Priesthood 1
might 1
seem 1
extravagant.” 1

It’s 0
almost 0
as 0
if 0
someone 0
had 0
slipped 0
a 0
copy 0
of 0
the 0
Ottaviani 0
Intervention 0
inside 0
his 0
morning 0
paper. 0

The 0

targeting 0
of 0
marriage, 0
through 0
the 0
instruments 0
of 0
creatures 0
like 0
the 0
myopic 0
and 0
theologically 0
tunnel-visioned 0
Cardinal 0
Kasper, 0
is 1
demonically 1
brilliant. 1

It’s 0
a 0
“stitch-up” 0
as 0
the 0
English 0
call 0
it; 0
a 0
fix. 0

You 0
make 0
it 0
a 0
matter 0
of 0
“mercy” 0
(backed 0
up 0
by 0
the 0
iron 0
fist) 0
that 0
no 0
one 0
in 0
a 0
state 0
of 0
objective 0
mortal 0
sin 0
can 0
be 0
refused 0
Holy 0
Communion; 0
you 0
give 0
the 0
national 0
bishops 0
conferences 0
the 0
power 0
to 0
start 0
enforcing 0
this, 0
and 0
you 0
have 0
created 0
a 0
previously 0
unimaginable 0
situation 0
in 0
the 0
Church. 0

You 0
have 0
created 0
a 0
regime 0
in 0
which 0
a 0
refusal 0
to 0
desecrate 0
the 0
sacred 0
species 0
will 0
be 0
grounds 0
for 0
persecution 0
of 0
faithful 0
priests, 0
seminarians 0
and 0
laity. 0

And 0
of 0
course, 0
we 0
are 0
seeing 0
it 0
starting 0
already. 0

It’s 0

a 0
brilliant 0
strategy, 0
the 0
magic 0
bullet 0
that 0
will 0
revert 0
the 0
Church 0
to 0
the 0
1976 0
model 0
on 0
every 0
front, 0
and 0
very 0
likely 0
keep 0
it 0
there 0
forever. 0

As 0
if 0
the 0
goal 0
was 0
to 0
go 0
back 0
in 0
time 0
and 0
erase 0
the 0
entire 0
John 0
Paul 0
II/Benedict 0
XVI 0
period 0
out 0
of 0
history. 0

It 0
will 0
halt 0
the 0
revival 0
of 0
eucharistic 0
piety 0
among 0
seminarians; 0
in 0
fact, 0
it 0
will 0
reverse 0
the 0
general 0
reforming 0
trend 0
of 0
“conservative” 0
seminaries 0
that 0
was 0
such 0
a 0
feature 0
under 0
John 0
Paul 0
II 0
and 0
has 0
for 0
30 0
years 0
been 0
the 0
hook 0
upon 0
which 0
all 0
hopes 0
of 0
restoration 0
have 0
hung. 0

It 0

is 0
easy 0
to 0
see 0
what 0
is 0
coming 0
next. 0

Once 0
certain 0
announcements 0
are 0
published 0
in 0
parish 0
bulletins, 0
laity 0
will 0
have 0
to 0
consider 0
whether 0
they 0
can, 0
in 0
conscience, 0
continue 0
to 0
assist 0
at 0
Masses 0
where 0
systematic 0
sacrilege 0
has 0
been 0
formally 0
adopted 0
as 0
the 0
rule. 0

The 0
few 0
bishops 0
with 0
sufficient 0
spine 0
to 0
stand 0
up 0
to 0
the 0
pressure 0
of 0
both 0
Rome 0
and 0
their 0
own 0
national 0
conferences 0
– 0
newly 0
empowered 0
with 0
directives 0
to 0
make 0
doctrinal 0
declarations 0
– 0
will 1
be 1
ruling 1
embattled 1
islands 1
of 1
Catholicism 1
in 1
a 1
poisoned 1
sea 1
of 1
systematic 1
heresy 1
and 1
desecration. 1

A 1
dark, 1
impenetrable 1
and 1
“irreversible” 1
winter 1
of 1
persecution 1
of 1
the 1
faithful 1
by 1
their 1
own 1
shepherds 1
will 1
fall. 1

Not 0

being 0
a 0
theologian 0
I 0
have 0
no 0
idea 0
if 0
this 0
encyclical 0
is, 0
as 0
so 0
many 0
of 0
these 0
seemingly 0
orthodox 0
documents 0
of 0
that 0
period 0
seem 0
to 0
be, 0
rife 0
with 0
the 0
usual 0
“time 0
bombs,” 0
ambiguities, 0
mushy 0
language 0
or 0
even 0
outright 0
errors. 0

I 0
haven’t 0
looked 0
it 0
up. 0

I’m 0
sure 0
there 0
are 0
plenty 0
of 0
people 0
out 0
there 0
qualified 0
to 0
examine 0
it 0
to 0
see 0
if 0
it’s 0
safe 0
for 0
Trad-Catholic 0
consumption. 0

And 0
I 0
have 0
no 0
doubt 0
at 0
all 0
that 0
there 0
are 0
better, 0
more 0
venerable, 0
even 0
more 0
sublime 0
and 0
poignant 0
works 0
on 0
the 0
Eucharist 0
in 0
the 0
canon 0
of 0
“official” 0
things. 0

From 0
saints 0
and 0
Doctors 0
of 0
the 0
Church 0
and 0
whatnot, 0
many 0
of 0
which 0
the 0
pope 0
cited. 0

But 1
whatever 1
its 1
flaws, 1
Mysterium 1
Fidei 1
is 1
the 1
one 1
I 1
found, 1
and 1
I’m 1
convinced 1
it 1
wasn’t 1
an 1
accident. 1

O 0

God, 0
in 0
Your 0
infinite 0
mercy, 0
forgive 0
and 0
have 0
mercy 0
on 0
Pope 0
Paul 0
VI 0
Montini 0
for 0
whatever 0
neglect 0
or 0
damage 0
of 0
which 0
he 0
may 0
have 0
been 0
guilty. 0

In 0
this 0
one 0
case 0
at 0
least, 0
a 0
work 0
of 0
his 0
was 0
the 0
exact 0
right 0
thing 0
at 0
the 0
exact 0
right 0
time. 0

For 0
me 0
at 0
least 0
it 0
was 0
the 0
key 0
that 0
opened 0
the 0
Door 0
to 0
Narnia. 0

that 0
four 0
years 0
before 0

Mass 0
was 0

Paul 0
VI 0
was 0

in 0

what 0
Bugnini 0

were 0

what 0
was 0
