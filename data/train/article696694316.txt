the 0 23 1

“Mysterium 0 23 1

the 0 23 1

anything 0 23 2

the 0 23 5

under 1 23 5

can 0 23 5
see 0 23 5
it 0 23 5
as 0 23 5
a 0 23 5
kind 0 23 5

warning 0 23 5

Published 0 23 6
just 0 23 6
three 0 23 6

before 0 23 6
the 0 23 6
close 0 23 6
of 0 23 6

just 0 23 6
as 0 23 6
Annibale 0 23 6

was 0 23 6
cranking 0 23 6
open 0 23 6
the 0 23 6

never-ending 0 23 6
stream 0 23 6
of 0 23 6
liturgical 0 23 6
alterations, 0 23 6
Mysterium 0 23 6

is 0 23 6
now 0 23 6
an 0 23 6
important 0 23 6

a 0 23 6
critical 0 23 6
turning 0 23 6
point 0 23 6
in 0 23 6
Catholic 0 23 6
history, 0 23 6
perhaps 0 23 6
the 0 23 6
most 0 23 6
important 0 23 6
of 0 23 6
modern 0 23 6
times. 0 23 6

Who 1 23 7
can 1 23 7
read 1 23 7
this 1 23 7
without 1 23 7
cringing 1 23 7
at 1 23 7
what 1 23 7
we 1 23 7
now 1 23 7
know 1 23 7
was 1 23 7
about 1 23 7
to 1 23 7
happen: 1 23 7

Therefore, 0 23 8
we 0 23 8
earnestly 0 23 8
hope 0 23 8
that 0 23 8
the 0 23 8
restored 0 23 8
sacred 0 23 8
liturgy 0 23 8
will 0 23 8
bring 0 23 8
forth 0 23 8
abundant 0 23 8
fruits 0 23 8
of 0 23 8
eucharistic 0 23 8
devotion, 0 23 8
so 0 23 8
that 0 23 8
the 0 23 8
Holy 0 23 8
Church, 0 23 8
under 0 23 8
this 0 23 8
saving 0 23 8
sign 0 23 8
of 0 23 8
piety, 0 23 8
may 0 23 8
make 0 23 8
daily 0 23 8
progress 0 23 8
toward 0 23 8
perfect 0 23 8
unity 0 23 8
and 0 23 8
may 0 23 8
invite 0 23 8
all 0 23 8
Christians 0 23 8
to 0 23 8
a 0 23 8
unity 0 23 8
of 0 23 8
faith 0 23 8
and 0 23 8
of 0 23 8
love, 0 23 8
drawing 0 23 8
them 0 23 8
gently, 0 23 8
thanks 0 23 8
to 0 23 8
the 0 23 8
action 0 23 8
of 0 23 8
divine 0 23 8
grace. 0 23 8

But 0 23 9
in 0 23 9
1983 0 23 9
at 0 23 9
the 0 23 9
start 0 23 9
of 0 23 9
my 0 23 9
personal 0 23 9
investigations 0 23 9
into 0 23 9
the 0 23 9
Catholic 0 23 9
religion, 0 23 9
I 0 23 9
knew 0 23 9
nothing 0 23 9
of 0 23 9
any 0 23 9
of 0 23 9
that. 0 23 9

The 0 23 10
encyclical, 0 23 10
the 0 23 10
very 0 23 10
first 0 23 10
I 0 23 10
ever 0 23 10
read, 0 23 10
was 0 23 10
also 0 23 10
a 0 23 10
marker 0 23 10
for 0 23 10
me 0 23 10
of 0 23 10
a 0 23 10
personal 0 23 10
turning 0 23 10
point. 0 23 10

It 0 23 11
was 0 23 11
the 0 23 11
first 0 23 11
time 0 23 11
I 0 23 11
had 0 23 11
ever 0 23 11
seen 0 23 11
Catholic 0 23 11
eucharistic 0 23 11
doctrine 0 23 11
clearly 0 23 11
and 0 23 11
– 0 23 11
most 0 23 11
importantly 0 23 11
– 0 23 11
unapologetically 0 23 11
stated. 0 23 11

It 0 23 12
came 0 23 12
right 0 23 12
out 0 23 12
and 0 23 12
said 0 23 12
something 0 23 12
so 0 23 12
astounding, 0 23 12
something 0 23 12
so 0 23 12
completely 0 23 12
unlikely, 0 23 12
that 0 23 12
I 0 23 12
had 0 23 12
to 0 23 12
admit 0 23 12
that 0 23 12
it 0 23 12
left 0 23 12
very 0 23 12
few 0 23 12
logical 0 23 12
possibilities. 0 23 12

Like 0 23 13
C.S. 0 23 13

Lewis’s 0 23 14
assessment 0 23 14
of 0 23 14
the 0 23 14
claims 0 23 14
by 0 23 14
Christ 0 23 14
of 0 23 14
His 0 23 14
own 0 23 14
divinity, 0 23 14
this 0 23 14
pope 0 23 14
was 0 23 14
either 0 23 14
mad, 0 23 14
bad 0 23 14
or 0 23 14
telling 0 23 14
the 0 23 14
plain 0 23 14
truth. 0 23 14

Something 0 23 15
that 0 23 15
may 0 23 15
be 0 23 15
much 0 23 15
more 0 23 15
noteworthy 0 23 15
now 0 23 15
in 0 23 15
our 0 23 15
current 0 23 15
circumstances 0 23 15
than 0 23 15
it 0 23 15
was 0 23 15
the 0 23 15
year 0 23 15
I 0 23 15
read 0 23 15
it, 0 23 15
is 0 23 15
that 0 23 15
the 0 23 15
pope’s 0 23 15
very 0 23 15
first 0 23 15
quote 0 23 15
was 0 23 15
not 0 23 15
of 0 23 15
scripture, 0 23 15
but 0 23 15
the 0 23 15
Council 0 23 15
of 0 23 15
Trent: 0 23 15

“At 0 23 16
the 0 23 16
Last 0 23 16
Supper, 0 23 16
on 0 23 16
the 0 23 16
night 0 23 16
He 0 23 16
was 0 23 16
handed 0 23 16
over, 0 23 16
Our 0 23 16
Lord 0 23 16
instituted 0 23 16
the 0 23 16
Eucharistic 0 23 16
Sacrifice 0 23 16
of 0 23 16
His 0 23 16
Body 0 23 16
and 0 23 16
Blood, 0 23 16
to 0 23 16
perpetuate 0 23 16
the 0 23 16
sacrifice 0 23 16
of 0 23 16
the 0 23 16
cross 0 23 16
throughout 0 23 16
the 0 23 16
ages 0 23 16
until 0 23 16
He 0 23 16
should 0 23 16
come, 0 23 16
and 0 23 16
thus 0 23 16
entrust 0 23 16
to 0 23 16
the 0 23 16
Church, 0 23 16
His 0 23 16
beloved 0 23 16
spouse, 0 23 16
the 0 23 16
memorial 0 23 16
of 0 23 16
His 0 23 16
death 0 23 16
and 0 23 16
resurrection: 0 23 16
a 0 23 16
sacrament 0 23 16
of 0 23 16
devotion, 0 23 16
a 0 23 16
sign 0 23 16
of 0 23 16
unity, 0 23 16
a 0 23 16
bond 0 23 16
of 0 23 16
charity, 0 23 16
a 0 23 16
paschal 0 23 16
banquet 0 23 16
in 0 23 16
which 0 23 16
Christ 0 23 16
is 0 23 16
received, 0 23 16
the 0 23 16
soul 0 23 16
is 0 23 16
filled 0 23 16
with 0 23 16
grace 0 23 16
and 0 23 16
there 0 23 16
is 0 23 16
given 0 23 16
to 0 23 16
us 0 23 16
the 0 23 16
pledge 0 23 16
of 0 23 16
future 0 23 16
glory.” 0 23 16

In 0 23 17
these 0 23 17
words 0 23 17
are 0 23 17
highlighted 0 23 17
both 0 23 17
the 0 23 17
sacrifice, 0 23 17
which 0 23 17
pertains 0 23 17
to 0 23 17
the 0 23 17
essence 0 23 17
of 0 23 17
the 0 23 17
Mass 0 23 17
which 0 23 17
is 0 23 17
celebrated 0 23 17
daily, 0 23 17
and 0 23 17
the 0 23 17
sacrament 0 23 17
in 0 23 17
which 0 23 17
the 0 23 17
faithful 0 23 17
participate 0 23 17
in 0 23 17
Holy 0 23 17
Communion 0 23 17
by 0 23 17
eating 0 23 17
the 0 23 17
Flesh 0 23 17
of 0 23 17
Christ 0 23 17
and 0 23 17
drinking 0 23 17
His 0 23 17
Blood, 0 23 17
receiving 0 23 17
both 0 23 17
grace, 0 23 17
the 0 23 17
beginning 0 23 17
of 0 23 17
eternal 0 23 17
life, 0 23 17
and 0 23 17
the 0 23 17
medicine 0 23 17
of 0 23 17
immortality. 0 23 17

I 0 23 18
remember 0 23 18
my 0 23 18
thoughts 0 23 18
upon 0 23 18
reading 0 23 18
this 0 23 18
shocking 0 23 18
statement… 0 23 18
“By 0 23 18
doing 0 23 18
what? 0 23 18

!” 0 23 19

My 0 23 20
acceptance 0 23 20
from 0 23 20
the 0 23 20
reading 0 23 20
of 0 23 20
this 0 23 20
document 0 23 20
of 0 23 20
the 0 23 20
Church’s 0 23 20
orthodox 0 23 20
eucharistic 0 23 20
doctrine 0 23 20
was 0 23 20
based 0 23 20
in 0 23 20
part 0 23 20
on 0 23 20
Pope 1 23 20
Paul’s 1 23 20
gracious 1 23 20
and 1 23 20
beautiful 1 23 20
exposition, 1 23 20
and 1 23 20
in 1 23 20
part 1 23 20
on 1 23 20
the 1 23 20
sheer 1 23 20
radical, 1 23 20
mad 1 23 20
unlikeliness 1 23 20
of 1 23 20

it. 1 23 21
What 0 23 21
could 0 23 21
conceivably 0 23 21
be 0 23 21
the 0 23 21
reason 0 23 21
to 0 23 21
say 0 23 21
anything 0 23 21
as 0 23 21
wild 0 23 21
as 0 23 21
this 0 23 21
if 0 23 21
it 0 23 21
weren’t 0 23 21
true? 0 23 21

The 1 23 22
idea 1 23 22
of 1 23 22
transubstantiation 1 23 22
struck 1 23 22
me 1 23 22
as 1 23 22
I 1 23 22
read 1 23 22
that 1 23 22
document 1 23 22
as 1 23 22
possibly 1 23 22
the 1 23 22
strangest 1 23 22
and 1 23 22
most 1 23 22
earth 1 23 22
shattering 1 23 22
thing 1 23 22
I’d 1 23 22
ever 1 23 22
heard. 1 23 22

It 1 23 23
shocked 1 23 23
me 1 23 23
out 1 23 23
of 1 23 23
a 1 23 23
kind 1 23 23
of 1 23 23
swamp 1 23 23
of 1 23 23
intellectual 1 23 23
worldliness; 1 23 23
presenting 1 23 23
the 1 23 23
idea 1 23 23
to 1 23 23
my 1 23 23
thirsty 1 23 23
mind 1 23 23
that 1 23 23
there 1 23 23
could 1 23 23
indeed 1 23 23
be 1 23 23
fantastic 1 23 23
realities 1 23 23
far 1 23 23
more 1 23 23
wonderful 1 23 23
than 1 23 23
the 1 23 23
banal 1 23 23
and 1 23 23
painfully 1 23 23
uninteresting 1 23 23
secularist 1 23 23
worldview 1 23 23
I 1 23 23
had 1 23 23
been 1 23 23
taught 1 23 23
to 1 23 23
accept. 1 23 23

It 1 23 24
was 1 23 24
as 1 23 24
though 1 23 24
someone 1 23 24
had 1 23 24
plausibly 1 23 24
told 1 23 24
me 1 23 24
that, 1 23 24
yes, 1 23 24
there 1 23 24
were 1 23 24
fairies 1 23 24
and 1 23 24
magical 1 23 24
kingdoms 1 23 24
in 1 23 24
real 1 23 24
life, 1 23 24
“just 1 23 24
around 1 23 24
the 1 23 24
corner”. 1 23 24

By 0 23 25
the 0 23 25
time 0 23 25
I 0 23 25
read 0 23 25
it, 0 23 25
I 0 23 25
had 0 23 25
been 0 23 25
through 0 23 25
a 0 23 25
long, 0 23 25
slow 0 23 25
transition 0 23 25
from 0 23 25
a 0 23 25
childhood 0 23 25
devoted 0 23 25
to 0 23 25
Our 0 23 25
Lady 0 23 25
and 0 23 25
confirmed 0 23 25
in 0 23 25
my 0 23 25
belief 0 23 25
in 0 23 25
wonders, 0 23 25
to 0 23 25
a 0 23 25
kind 0 23 25
of 0 23 25
disappointed 0 23 25
practical 0 23 25
atheism 0 23 25
after 0 23 25
three 0 23 25
years 0 23 25
in 0 23 25
a 0 23 25
diocesan 0 23 25
Catholic 0 23 25
parochial 0 23 25
school. 0 23 25

I 0 23 26
had 0 23 26
been 0 23 26
taught, 0 23 26
by 0 23 26
both 0 23 26
word 0 23 26
and 0 23 26
implication, 0 23 26
that 0 23 26
everything 0 23 26
the 0 23 26
Catholic 0 23 26
Church 0 23 26
had 0 23 26
taught 0 23 26
before 0 23 26
Vatican 0 23 26
II 0 23 26
was 0 23 26
pernicious 1 23 26
nonsense. 1 23 26

Where 0 23 27
it 0 23 27
was 0 23 27
simply 0 23 27
wrong 0 23 27
it 0 23 27
was 0 23 27
ridiculous 0 23 27
and 0 23 27
where 0 23 27
it 0 23 27
was 0 23 27
wrong 0 23 27
and 0 23 27
political 0 23 27
it 1 23 27
was 1 23 27
outright 1 23 27
wicked. 1 23 27

What 0 23 28
led 0 23 28
me 0 23 28
to 0 23 28
read 0 23 28
that 0 23 28
particular 0 23 28
encyclical 0 23 28
is 0 23 28
the 0 23 28
most 0 23 28
clearly 0 23 28
identifiable 0 23 28
moment 0 23 28
of 0 23 28
actual 0 23 28
grace 0 23 28
in 0 23 28
my 0 23 28
young 0 23 28
life 0 23 28
to 0 23 28
that 0 23 28

point. 0 23 29
It 0 23 29
was 0 23 29
the 0 23 29
first 0 23 29
time 0 23 29
it 0 23 29
occurred 0 23 29
to 0 23 29
me 0 23 29
to 0 23 29
investigate, 0 23 29
like 0 23 29
an 0 23 29
anthropologist, 0 23 29
what 0 23 29
the 0 23 29
Church 0 23 29
herself 0 23 29
said 0 23 29
about 0 23 29
her 0 23 29
teachings. 0 23 29

While 0 23 30
mulling 0 23 30
grimly 0 23 30
one 0 23 30
day 0 23 30
over 0 23 30
all 0 23 30
the 0 23 30
wickedness 0 23 30
of 0 23 30
the 0 23 30
Catholic 0 23 30
Church, 0 23 30
I 0 23 30
was 0 23 30
pulled 0 23 30
up 0 23 30
short 0 23 30
by 0 23 30
a 0 23 30
single 0 23 30
thought: 0 23 30
“I 0 23 30
could 0 23 30
be 0 23 30
wrong.” 0 23 30
At 0 23 30
17 0 23 30
it 0 23 30
seemed 0 23 30
such 0 23 30
an 0 23 30
unlikely 0 23 30
thing 0 23 30
to 0 23 30
think 0 23 30
I 0 23 30
was 0 23 30
rather 0 23 30
shocked. 0 23 30

But 0 23 31
stopping 0 23 31
a 0 23 31
moment 0 23 31
to 0 23 31
consider, 0 23 31
I 0 23 31
realised 0 23 31
that 0 23 31
I 0 23 31
had 0 23 31
only 0 23 31
ever 0 23 31
heard 0 23 31
about 0 23 31
Catholic 0 23 31
things 0 23 31
from 0 23 31
people 0 23 31
who 0 23 31
clearly 0 23 31
hated 0 23 31
the 0 23 31
Church; 0 23 31
her 0 23 31
enemies, 0 23 31
in 0 23 31

short. 0 23 32
It 0 23 32
hardly 0 23 32
seemed 0 23 32
just 0 23 32
to 0 23 32
convict 0 23 32
on 0 23 32
the 0 23 32
testimony 0 23 32
of 0 23 32
these 0 23 32
obviously 0 23 32
biased 0 23 32
witnesses. 0 23 32

In 0 23 33
order 0 23 33
to 0 23 33
properly 0 23 33
and 0 23 33
thoroughly 0 23 33
condemn 0 23 33
the 0 23 33
Church, 0 23 33
with 0 23 33
convincing 0 23 33
due 0 23 33
diligence, 0 23 33
I 0 23 33
had 0 23 33
to 0 23 33
read 0 23 33
something 0 23 33
about 0 23 33
it 0 23 33
that 0 23 33
didn’t 0 23 33
come 0 23 33
from 0 23 33
her 0 23 33
enemies. 0 23 33

The 0 23 34
same 0 23 34
day, 0 23 34
I 0 23 34
presented 0 23 34
myself 0 23 34
at 0 23 34
the 0 23 34
reference 0 23 34
desk 0 23 34
of 0 23 34
the 0 23 34
public 0 23 34
library 0 23 34
and 0 23 34
asked, 0 23 34
“Do 0 23 34
you 0 23 34
have 0 23 34
any 0 23 34
books 0 23 34
about 0 23 34
Catholicism? 0 23 34

Something 0 23 35
official?” 0 23 35
The 0 23 35
librarian 0 23 35
took 0 23 35
me 0 23 35
to 0 23 35
the 0 23 35
reference 0 23 35
section 0 23 35
and 0 23 35
showed 0 23 35
me 0 23 35
the 0 23 35
shelves 0 23 35
of 0 23 35
encyclicals, 0 23 35
documents 0 23 35
and 0 23 35
histories. 0 23 35

Saints 0 23 36
and 0 23 36
popes 0 23 36
from 0 23 36
one 0 23 36
end 0 23 36
of 0 23 36
the 0 23 36
stacks 0 23 36
to 0 23 36
the 0 23 36

other. 0 23 37
Having 0 23 37
no 0 23 37
clear 0 23 37
idea 0 23 37
what 0 23 37
my 0 23 37
own 0 23 37
question 0 23 37
meant, 0 23 37
I 0 23 37
just 0 23 37
picked 0 23 37
one 0 23 37
at 0 23 37

random. 0 23 38
The 0 23 38
description 0 23 38
of 0 23 38
the 0 23 38
Holy 0 23 38
Eucharist 0 23 38
as 0 23 38
the 0 23 38
supreme 0 23 38
Centre 0 23 38
from 0 23 38
which 0 23 38
all 0 23 38
our 0 23 38
life 0 23 38
as 0 23 38
Catholics 0 23 38
flow, 0 23 38
and 0 23 38
from 0 23 38
which 0 23 38
all 0 23 38
other 0 23 38
doctrines 0 23 38
radiated, 0 23 38
was 0 23 38
something 0 23 38
that 0 23 38
was 0 23 38
not 0 23 38
going 0 23 38
to 0 23 38
come 0 23 38
into 0 23 38
my 0 23 38
head 0 23 38
for 0 23 38
another 0 23 38
eight 0 23 38
years 0 23 38
of 0 23 38

reading. 0 23 39
But 0 23 39
even 0 23 39
so, 0 23 39
Mysterium 0 23 39
Fidei 0 23 39
forced 0 23 39
me 0 23 39
to 0 23 39
face 0 23 39
up 0 23 39
to 0 23 39
a 0 23 39
reality 0 23 39
I’d 0 23 39
never 0 23 39
dreamed 0 23 39
of 0 23 39
before; 0 23 39
that 0 23 39
this, 0 23 39
the 0 23 39
little 0 23 39
unassuming 0 23 39
wafer, 0 23 39
was 0 23 39
the 0 23 39
most 0 23 39
important 0 23 39
thing 0 23 39
in 0 23 39
the 0 23 39

world. 0 23 40
Reading 0 23 40
through 0 23 40
the 0 23 40
encyclical 0 23 40
again, 0 23 40
holding 0 23 40
it 0 23 40
up 0 23 40
next 0 23 40
to 0 23 40
the 0 23 40
current 0 23 40
situation 0 23 40
in 0 23 40
Rome, 0 23 40
makes 0 23 40
it 0 23 40
easier 0 23 40
to 0 23 40
clarify 0 23 40
certain 0 23 40
critical 0 23 40

issues. 0 23 41
Given 0 23 41
what 0 23 41
we 0 23 41
are 0 23 41
now 0 23 41
seeing, 0 23 41
consider 0 23 41
the 0 23 41
poignancy 0 23 41
of 0 23 41
the 0 23 41
following 0 23 41

passages: 0 23 42
When 0 23 42
dealing 0 23 42
with 0 23 42
the 0 23 42
restoration 0 23 42
of 0 23 42
the 0 23 42
sacred 0 23 42
liturgy, 0 23 42
the 0 23 42
Fathers 0 23 42
of 0 23 42
the 0 23 42
council, 0 23 42
by 0 23 42
reason 0 23 42
of 0 23 42
their 0 23 42
pastoral 0 23 42
concern 0 23 42
for 0 23 42
the 0 23 42
whole 0 23 42
Church, 0 23 42
considered 0 23 42
it 0 23 42
of 0 23 42
the 0 23 42
highest 0 23 42
importance 0 23 42
to 0 23 42
exhort 0 23 42
the 0 23 42
faithful 0 23 42
to 0 23 42
participate 0 23 42
actively 0 23 42
with 0 23 42
sound 0 23 42
faith 0 23 42
and 0 23 42
with 0 23 42
the 0 23 42
utmost 0 23 42
devotion 0 23 42
in 0 23 42
the 0 23 42
celebration 0 23 42
of 0 23 42
this 0 23 42
Most 0 23 42
Holy 0 23 42
Mystery, 0 23 42
to 0 23 42
offer 0 23 42
it 0 23 42
with 0 23 42
the 0 23 42
priest 0 23 42
to 0 23 42
God 0 23 42
as 0 23 42
a 0 23 42
sacrifice 0 23 42
for 0 23 42
their 0 23 42
own 0 23 42
salvation 0 23 42
and 0 23 42
for 0 23 42
that 0 23 42
of 0 23 42
the 0 23 42
whole 0 23 42
world, 0 23 42
and 0 23 42
to 0 23 42
find 0 23 42
in 0 23 42
it 0 23 42
spiritual 0 23 42
nourishment. 0 23 42

This 0 23 43
was, 0 23 43
remember, 0 23 43
1965, 0 23 43
four 0 23 43
years 0 23 43
before 0 23 43
the 0 23 43
New 0 23 43
Mass 0 23 43
was 0 23 43
issued 0 23 43
and 0 23 43
before 0 23 43
Cardinal 0 23 43
Ottaviani 0 23 43
warned 0 23 43
the 0 23 43
pope 0 23 43
that 0 23 43
it 0 23 43
was 0 23 43
precisely 0 23 43
this 1 23 43
sacramental 1 23 43
reality 1 23 43
that 1 23 43
was 1 23 43
about 1 23 43
to 1 23 43
be 1 23 43
catastrophically 1 23 43

obscured. 1 23 44
Who, 0 23 44
reading 0 23 44
this 0 23 44
passage, 0 23 44
does 0 23 44
not 0 23 44
feel 0 23 44
the 0 23 44
urge 0 23 44
to 0 23 44
shout 0 23 44
down 0 23 44
the 0 23 44
years, 0 23 44
to 0 23 44
do 0 23 44
something 0 23 44
to 0 23 44
stave 0 23 44
off 0 23 44
the 0 23 44
disaster 0 23 44
that 0 23 44

was 0 23 45
coming: 0 23 45
[W]e 0 23 45
are 0 23 45
aware 0 23 45
of 0 23 45
the 0 23 45
fact 0 23 45
that, 0 23 45
among 0 23 45
those 0 23 45
who 0 23 45
deal 0 23 45
with 0 23 45
this 0 23 45
Most 0 23 45
Holy 0 23 45
Mystery 0 23 45
in 0 23 45
written 0 23 45
or 0 23 45
spoken 0 23 45
word, 0 23 45
there 0 23 45
are 0 23 45
some 0 23 45
who 0 23 45
with 0 23 45
reference 0 23 45
either 0 23 45
to 0 23 45
Masses 0 23 45
which 0 23 45
are 0 23 45
celebrated 0 23 45
in 0 23 45
private, 0 23 45
or 0 23 45
to 0 23 45
the 0 23 45
dogma 0 23 45
of 0 23 45
transubstantiation, 0 23 45
or 0 23 45
to 0 23 45
devotion 0 23 45
to 0 23 45
the 0 23 45
Eucharist, 0 23 45
spread 0 23 45
abroad 0 23 45
opinions 0 23 45
which 0 23 45
disturb 0 23 45
the 0 23 45
faithful 0 23 45
and 0 23 45
fill 0 23 45
their 0 23 45
minds 0 23 45
with 0 23 45
no 0 23 45
little 0 23 45
confusion 0 23 45
about 0 23 45
matters 0 23 45

of 0 23 46
faith. 0 23 46
It 0 23 46
is 0 23 46
as 0 23 46
if 0 23 46
everyone 0 23 46
were 0 23 46
permitted 0 23 46
to 0 23 46
consign 0 23 46
to 0 23 46
oblivion 0 23 46
doctrine 0 23 46
already 0 23 46
defined 0 23 46
by 0 23 46
the 0 23 46
Church, 0 23 46
or 0 23 46
else 0 23 46
to 0 23 46
interpret 0 23 46
it 0 23 46
in 0 23 46
such 0 23 46
a 0 23 46
way 0 23 46
as 0 23 46
to 0 23 46
weaken 0 23 46
the 0 23 46
genuine 0 23 46
meaning 0 23 46
of 0 23 46
the 0 23 46
words 0 23 46
or 0 23 46
the 0 23 46
recognized 0 23 46
force 0 23 46
of 0 23 46
the 0 23 46
concepts 0 23 46

involved. 0 23 47
Keeping 0 23 47
Cardinal 0 23 47
Ottaviani’s 0 23 47
Intervention 0 23 47
directly 0 23 47
before 0 23 47
our 0 23 47
thoughts, 0 23 47
we 0 23 47
read 0 23 47
with 0 23 47
a 0 23 47
strange 0 23 47
kind 0 23 47
of 0 23 47
helpless 0 23 47

dread… 0 23 48
…it 1 23 48
is 1 23 48
not 1 23 48
allowable 1 23 48
to 1 23 48
emphasize 1 23 48
what 1 23 48
is 1 23 48
called 1 23 48
the 1 23 48
“communal” 1 23 48
Mass 1 23 48
to 1 23 48
the 1 23 48
disparagement 1 23 48
of 1 23 48
Masses 1 23 48
celebrated 1 23 48
in 1 23 48
private, 1 23 48
or 1 23 48
to 1 23 48
exaggerate 1 23 48
the 1 23 48
element 1 23 48
of 1 23 48
sacramental 1 23 48
sign 1 23 48
as 1 23 48
if 1 23 48
the 1 23 48
symbolism, 1 23 48
which 1 23 48
all 1 23 48
certainly 1 23 48
admit 1 23 48
in 1 23 48
the 1 23 48
Eucharist, 1 23 48
expresses 1 23 48
fully 1 23 48
and 1 23 48
exhausts 1 23 48
completely 1 23 48
the 1 23 48
mode 1 23 48
of 1 23 48
Christ’s 1 23 48
presence 1 23 48
in 1 23 48
this 1 23 48

sacrament. 1 23 49
Nor 1 23 49
is 1 23 49
it 1 23 49
allowable 1 23 49
to 1 23 49
discuss 1 23 49
the 1 23 49
mystery 1 23 49
of 1 23 49
transubstantiation 1 23 49
without 1 23 49
mentioning 1 23 49
what 1 23 49
the 1 23 49
Council 1 23 49
of 1 23 49
Trent 1 23 49
stated 1 23 49
about 1 23 49
the 1 23 49
marvelous 1 23 49
conversion 1 23 49
of 1 23 49
the 1 23 49
whole 1 23 49
substance 1 23 49
of 1 23 49
the 1 23 49
bread 1 23 49
into 1 23 49
the 1 23 49
Body 1 23 49
and 1 23 49
of 1 23 49
the 1 23 49
whole 1 23 49
substance 1 23 49
of 1 23 49
the 1 23 49
wine 1 23 49
into 1 23 49
the 1 23 49
Blood 1 23 49
of 1 23 49
Christ, 1 23 49
speaking 1 23 49
rather 1 23 49
only 1 23 49
of 1 23 49
what 1 23 49
is 1 23 49
called 1 23 49
“transignification” 1 23 49

been 0 23 53
working 0 23 53
to 0 23 53
clarify 0 23 53
that 0 23 53
the 0 23 53
attack 0 23 53
from 0 23 53

moral 0 23 53
doctrine 0 23 53
of 0 23 53
the 0 23 53
Church 0 23 53
isn’t 0 23 53
about 0 23 53

marriage. 0 23 54
It’s 0 23 54
about 0 23 54
the 0 23 54
Eucharist 0 23 54
and 0 23 54
to 0 23 54
a 0 23 54

The 1 23 55
demonic 1 23 55
forces 1 23 55
we 1 23 55
know 1 23 55
are 1 23 55
the 1 23 55
driving 1 23 55
force 1 23 55
behind 1 23 55
this 1 23 55
supreme 1 23 55
moment 1 23 55
of 1 23 55
heresy 1 23 55
and 1 23 55
destruction 1 23 55
aren’t 1 23 55
really 1 23 55
looking 1 23 55
at 1 23 55
the 1 23 55
undermining 1 23 55
of 1 23 55
marriage 1 23 55
as 1 23 55
their 1 23 55
primary 1 23 55
goal; 1 23 55
they 1 23 55
want 1 23 55
to 1 23 55
get 1 23 55
at 1 23 55
the 1 23 55

Eucharist. 1 23 56
We 1 23 56
know 1 23 56
it 1 23 56
is 1 23 56
demonically 1 23 56
inspired 1 23 56
because 1 23 56
their 1 23 56
hatred 1 23 56
is 1 23 56
for 1 23 56
Christ 1 23 56
Himself 1 23 56
in 1 23 56
the 1 23 56
first 1 23 56
place 1 23 56
and 1 23 56
for 1 23 56
anyone 1 23 56
who 1 23 56
loves 1 23 56
and 1 23 56
wants 1 23 56
to 1 23 56
serve 1 23 56

Him 1 23 57
second. 1 23 57
They 1 23 57
are 1 23 57
men 1 23 57
who 1 23 57
refuse 1 23 57
to 1 23 57
bend 1 23 57
the 1 23 57
knee 1 23 57
before 1 23 57
the 1 23 57
God 1 23 57
whom 1 23 57
they 1 23 57
will 1 23 57

not 1 23 58
serve. 1 23 58
This 0 23 58
knowledge 0 23 58
– 0 23 58
that 0 23 58
the 0 23 58
attack 0 23 58
is 0 23 58
on 0 23 58
the 0 23 58
Body 0 23 58
and 0 23 58
Blood 0 23 58

in 0 23 59
the 0 23 59

The 0 23 59
places 0 23 59
where 0 23 59
Eucharistic 0 23 59
adoration 0 23 59
is 0 23 59
still 0 23 59
offered 0 23 59
are 0 23 59
places 0 23 59
where 0 23 59

some 0 23 59
flicker 0 23 59
of 0 23 59
the 0 23 59

The 0 23 60
bishops 0 23 60

of 0 23 60

to 0 23 60
defend 0 23 60
it 0 23 60
from 0 23 60

in 0 23 62
England. 0 23 62
In 0 23 62
March, 0 23 62
2016, 0 23 62
in 0 23 62
the 0 23 62
midst 0 23 62
of 0 23 62
the 0 23 62
shouting 0 23 62
from 0 23 62
Rome, 0 23 62
Bishop 0 23 62
Davies 0 23 62
spoke 0 23 62
at 0 23 62
his 0 23 62
Chrism 0 23 62
Mass 0 23 62
said 0 23 62
that 0 23 62
only 0 23 62
through 0 23 62
the 0 23 62
“reality 0 23 62
of 0 23 62
the 0 23 62
Eucharist” 0 23 62
could 0 23 62
new 0 23 62
vocations 0 23 62
to 0 23 62
the 0 23 62
priesthood 0 23 62

be 0 23 63
found. 0 23 63
“In 0 23 63
treasuring 0 23 63
this 0 23 63
gift 0 23 63
of 0 23 63
priestly 0 23 63
celibacy 0 23 63
we 0 23 63
need 0 23 63
to 0 23 63
recognize 0 23 63
more 0 23 63
clearly 0 23 63
the 0 23 63
intimate 0 23 63
link 0 23 63
between 0 23 63
the 0 23 63
Ministerial 0 23 63

and 0 23 63
the 0 23 63
reality 0 23 63
of 0 23 63

the 0 23 64
Eucharist. 0 23 64
If 1 23 64
the 1 23 64
Mass 1 23 64
were 1 23 64
ever 1 23 64
reduced 1 23 64
in 1 23 64
our 1 23 64
minds 1 23 64
to 1 23 64
being 1 23 64
merely 1 23 64
a 1 23 64
commemorative 1 23 64
meal 1 23 64

the 1 23 64
priest 1 23 64

only 1 23 64
a 1 23 64
community 1 23 64
leader 1 23 64
or 1 23 64
functionary, 1 23 64
then 1 23 64
the 1 23 64
celibacy 1 23 64
of 1 23 64
the 1 23 64
Catholic 1 23 64
Priesthood 1 23 64
might 1 23 64
seem 1 23 64

extravagant.” 1 23 65
It’s 0 23 65
almost 0 23 65
as 0 23 65
if 0 23 65
someone 0 23 65

tunnel-visioned 0 23 66
Cardinal 0 23 66
Kasper, 0 23 66
is 1 23 66
demonically 1 23 66

brilliant. 1 23 67
It’s 0 23 67
a 0 23 67
“stitch-up” 0 23 67
as 0 23 67
the 0 23 67
English 0 23 67

call 0 23 68
it; 0 23 68
a 0 23 68
fix. 0 23 68
You 0 23 68
make 0 23 68
it 0 23 68
a 0 23 68
matter 0 23 68
of 0 23 68
“mercy” 0 23 68
(backed 0 23 68
up 0 23 68
by 0 23 68
the 0 23 68
iron 0 23 68
fist) 0 23 68
that 0 23 68
no 0 23 68

can 0 23 68
be 0 23 68
refused 0 23 68
Holy 0 23 68
Communion; 0 23 68
you 0 23 68
give 0 23 68
the 0 23 68
national 0 23 68
bishops 0 23 68
conferences 0 23 68
the 0 23 68
power 0 23 68
to 0 23 68
start 0 23 68
enforcing 0 23 68
this, 0 23 68
and 0 23 68
you 0 23 68
have 0 23 68
created 0 23 68
a 0 23 68
previously 0 23 68
unimaginable 0 23 68
situation 0 23 68

in 0 23 69
the 0 23 69
Church. 0 23 69
You 0 23 69
have 0 23 69
created 0 23 69
a 0 23 69
regime 0 23 69
in 0 23 69
which 0 23 69
a 0 23 69

the 0 23 69

be 0 23 69
grounds 0 23 69
for 0 23 69
persecution 0 23 69
of 0 23 69
faithful 0 23 69
priests, 0 23 69
seminarians 0 23 69

and 0 23 70
laity. 0 23 70
And 0 23 70
of 0 23 70
course, 0 23 70
we 0 23 70
are 0 23 70
seeing 0 23 70
it 0 23 70
starting 0 23 70

already. 0 23 71
It’s 0 23 71
a 0 23 71
brilliant 0 23 71
strategy, 0 23 71
the 0 23 71
magic 0 23 71
bullet 0 23 71
that 0 23 71
will 0 23 71
revert 0 23 71
the 0 23 71
Church 0 23 71
to 0 23 71
the 0 23 71
1976 0 23 71
model 0 23 71
on 0 23 71
every 0 23 71
front, 0 23 71
and 0 23 71
very 0 23 71
likely 0 23 71
keep 0 23 71
it 0 23 71

there 0 23 72
forever. 0 23 72
As 0 23 72
if 0 23 72
the 0 23 72
goal 0 23 72
was 0 23 72
to 0 23 72
go 0 23 72
back 0 23 72
in 0 23 72
time 0 23 72

II/Benedict 0 23 72
XVI 0 23 72
period 0 23 72

out 0 23 73
of 0 23 73
history. 0 23 73
It 0 23 73
will 0 23 73
halt 0 23 73
the 0 23 73
revival 0 23 73
of 0 23 73
eucharistic 0 23 73
piety 0 23 73
among 0 23 73
seminarians; 0 23 73
in 0 23 73
fact, 0 23 73
it 0 23 73
will 0 23 73
reverse 0 23 73
the 0 23 73
general 0 23 73
reforming 0 23 73
trend 0 23 73
of 0 23 73
“conservative” 0 23 73
seminaries 0 23 73
that 0 23 73
was 0 23 73
such 0 23 73
a 0 23 73
feature 0 23 73
under 0 23 73
John 0 23 73
Paul 0 23 73
II 0 23 73
and 0 23 73
has 0 23 73
for 0 23 73
30 0 23 73
years 0 23 73
been 0 23 73
the 0 23 73
hook 0 23 73
upon 0 23 73
which 0 23 73
all 0 23 73
hopes 0 23 73
of 0 23 73
restoration 0 23 73

have 0 23 74
hung. 0 23 74
It 0 23 74
is 0 23 74
easy 0 23 74
to 0 23 74
see 0 23 74
what 0 23 74

is 0 23 75
coming 0 23 75
next. 0 23 75
Once 0 23 75
certain 0 23 75
announcements 0 23 75
are 0 23 75
published 0 23 75
in 0 23 75
parish 0 23 75
bulletins, 0 23 75
laity 0 23 75
will 0 23 75
have 0 23 75
to 0 23 75
consider 0 23 75
whether 0 23 75
they 0 23 75
can, 0 23 75
in 0 23 75
conscience, 0 23 75
continue 0 23 75
to 0 23 75
assist 0 23 75
at 0 23 75
Masses 0 23 75
where 0 23 75
systematic 0 23 75
sacrilege 0 23 75
has 0 23 75
been 0 23 75
formally 0 23 75
adopted 0 23 75

as 0 23 76
the 0 23 76
rule. 0 23 76
The 0 23 76
few 0 23 76
bishops 0 23 76
with 0 23 76
sufficient 0 23 76
spine 0 23 76
to 0 23 76
stand 0 23 76
up 0 23 76
to 0 23 76
the 0 23 76
pressure 0 23 76
of 0 23 76
both 0 23 76

doctrinal 0 23 76

will 1 23 76
be 1 23 76
ruling 1 23 76
embattled 1 23 76
islands 1 23 76
of 1 23 76
Catholicism 1 23 76
in 1 23 76
a 1 23 76
poisoned 1 23 76
sea 1 23 76
of 1 23 76
systematic 1 23 76
heresy 1 23 76

and 1 23 77
desecration. 1 23 77
A 1 23 77
dark, 1 23 77
impenetrable 1 23 77
and 1 23 77
“irreversible” 1 23 77
winter 1 23 77
of 1 23 77
persecution 1 23 77
of 1 23 77

faithful 1 23 77
by 1 23 77
their 1 23 77
own 1 23 77

fall. 1 23 78
Not 0 23 78
being 0 23 78
a 0 23 78

I 0 23 78
have 0 23 78
no 0 23 78

many 0 23 78

rife 0 23 78
with 0 23 78
the 0 23 78
usual 0 23 78
“time 0 23 78

ambiguities, 0 23 78
mushy 0 23 78

even 0 23 78

outright 0 23 79
errors. 0 23 79
I 0 23 79
haven’t 0 23 79

looked 0 23 80
it 0 23 80
up. 0 23 80
I’m 0 23 80
sure 0 23 80
there 0 23 80
are 0 23 80
plenty 0 23 80
of 0 23 80
people 0 23 80
out 0 23 80

qualified 0 23 80

consumption. 0 23 81
And 0 23 81
I 0 23 81
have 0 23 81
no 0 23 81
doubt 0 23 81
at 0 23 81
all 0 23 81
that 0 23 81
there 0 23 81
are 0 23 81
better, 0 23 81
more 0 23 81
venerable, 0 23 81
even 0 23 81
more 0 23 81
sublime 0 23 81
and 0 23 81
poignant 0 23 81
works 0 23 81
on 0 23 81
the 0 23 81
Eucharist 0 23 81
in 0 23 81
the 0 23 81
canon 0 23 81
of 0 23 81

“official” 0 23 82
things. 0 23 82
From 0 23 82
saints 0 23 82
and 0 23 82
Doctors 0 23 82
of 0 23 82
the 0 23 82
Church 0 23 82
and 0 23 82
whatnot, 0 23 82
many 0 23 82
of 0 23 82
which 0 23 82

the 0 23 83
pope 0 23 83
cited. 0 23 83

whatever 1 23 83
its 1 23 83
flaws, 1 23 83
Mysterium 1 23 83
Fidei 1 23 83
is 1 23 83
the 1 23 83
one 1 23 83
I 1 23 83
found, 1 23 83
and 1 23 83
I’m 1 23 83
convinced 1 23 83
it 1 23 83
wasn’t 1 23 83

an 1 23 84
accident. 1 23 84
O 0 23 84
God, 0 23 84
in 0 23 84
Your 0 23 84
infinite 0 23 84
mercy, 0 23 84
forgive 0 23 84
and 0 23 84
have 0 23 84
mercy 0 23 84
on 0 23 84
Pope 0 23 84
Paul 0 23 84
VI 0 23 84
Montini 0 23 84

whatever 0 23 84
neglect 0 23 84
or 0 23 84
damage 0 23 84
of 0 23 84
which 0 23 84
he 0 23 84
may 0 23 84

have 0 23 85
been 0 23 85
guilty. 0 23 85
In 0 23 85
this 0 23 85
one 0 23 85
case 0 23 85
at 0 23 85
least, 0 23 85
a 0 23 85
work 0 23 85
of 0 23 85
his 0 23 85
was 0 23 85
the 0 23 85
exact 0 23 85
right 0 23 85
thing 0 23 85
at 0 23 85
the 0 23 85

exact 0 23 86
right 0 23 86
time. 0 23 86
For 0 23 86
me 0 23 86
at 0 23 86
least 0 23 86
it 0 23 86
was 0 23 86
the 0 23 86
key 0 23 86
that 0 23 86
opened 0 23 86

the 0 23 87
Door 0 23 87
to 0 23 87
Narnia. 0 23 87
