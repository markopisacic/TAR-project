In 0
astronomy, 0
a 0
light-year 0
is 0
a 0
commonly 0
used 0
unit 0
to 0
measure 0
distance, 0
but 0
some 0
astronomers 0
prefer 0
to 0
use 0
a 0
unit 0
called 0
the 0
parsec. 0

When 0
referring 0
to 0
something 0
larger, 0
they 0
use 0
kiloparsecs, 0
which 0
are 0
equal 0
to 0
1,000 0
parsecs, 0
and 0
megaparsecs, 0
equal 0
to 0
one 0
million 0
parsecs. 0

The 0
Milky 0
Way 0
measures 0
about 0
100,000 0
light-years 0
or 0
30 0
kiloparsecs 0
across. 0

This 0
may 0
seem 0
large, 0
but 0
it 0
is 0
rather 0
small 0
when 0
compared 0
to 0
other 0
galaxies. 0

The 0
Andromeda 0
Galaxy 0
has 0
an 0
approximate 0
diameter 0
of 0
220,000 0
light 0
years, 0
which 0
is 0
more 0
than 0
double 0
of 0
that 0
of 0
the 0
Milky 0
Way. 0

It 0
is 0
the 0
largest 0
galaxy 0
in 0
the 0
Local 0
Cluster. 0

If 0
it 0
were 0
bright 0
enough, 0
the 0
Andromeda 0
Galaxy 0
would 0
appear 0
larger 0
than 0
the 0

in 0
the 0

(as 0

only 0
384,400 0
