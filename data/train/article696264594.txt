The 0 22 4

of 0 22 4
the 0 22 4
AJHS 0 22 4

have 0 22 4
been 0 22 4
a 0 22 4
series 0 22 4
of 0 22 4
events 0 22 4
attacking 0 22 4
Israel. 0 22 4

Coming 0 22 5
up 0 22 5
in 0 22 5
late 0 22 5
October 0 22 5
is 0 22 5
“The 0 22 5

State?” 0 22 5

The 0 22 6
two 0 22 6
speakers 0 22 6
are 0 22 6
Robert 0 22 6
Herbst, 0 22 6
the 0 22 6
coordinator 0 22 6
of 0 22 6
the 0 22 6
Westchester 0 22 6
chapter 0 22 6
of 0 22 6
JVP, 0 22 6
and 0 22 6
Jonathan 0 22 6
Kuttab, 0 22 6
who 0 22 6
advocates 0 22 6
a 0 22 6
one-state 0 22 6
solution 0 22 6
for 0 22 6
eliminating 0 22 6
Israel. 0 22 6

He 0 22 7
had 0 22 7
tweeted, 0 22 7
"EU 1 22 7
no 1 22 7
longer 1 22 7
considers 1 22 7
#Hamas 1 22 7
a 1 22 7
terrorist 1 22 7
group. 1 22 7

Time 1 22 8
for 1 22 8
US 1 22 8
to 1 22 8
do 1 22 8
same." 1 22 8

Kuttab 0 22 9
has 0 22 9
defended 0 22 9
Islamic 0 22 9
anti-Semitism 0 22 9
by 0 22 9
claiming 0 22 9
that 0 22 9
the 0 22 9
“distrust 0 22 9
Moslems 0 22 9
feel 0 22 9
towards 0 22 9
Jews” 0 22 9
is 0 22 9
due 0 22 9
to 0 22 9
“two 0 22 9
acts 0 22 9
of 0 22 9
betrayal 0 22 9
by 0 22 9
Jewish 0 22 9
tribes 0 22 9
against 0 22 9
the 0 22 9
Prophet.” 0 22 9
And 0 22 9
that 0 22 9
Jews 0 22 9
suffer 0 22 9
from 0 22 9
a 0 22 9
“Holocaust 1 22 9
Syndrome” 1 22 9
of 1 22 9
entitlement. 1 22 9

He 0 22 10
justified 0 22 10
hijacking 0 22 10
planes, 0 22 10
described 0 22 10
suicide 0 22 10
bombers 0 22 10
as 0 22 10
“taking 0 22 10
the 0 22 10
supreme 0 22 10
sacrifice” 0 22 10
and 0 22 10
defended 0 22 10
Hezbollah 1 22 10
as 1 22 10
“an 1 22 10
armed-resistance 1 22 10
movement” 1 22 10

He 0 22 11
has 0 22 11
claimed 0 22 11
that 0 22 11
the 0 22 11
"Jewish 0 22 11
community 0 22 11
gradually 0 22 11
consolidated 0 22 11
its 0 22 11
power, 0 22 11
wealth, 0 22 11
and 0 22 11
influence 0 22 11
in 0 22 11
all 0 22 11
sectors 0 22 11
of 0 22 11
society" 0 22 11
especially 0 22 11
in 0 22 11
"crucial 0 22 11
sectors 0 22 11
like 0 22 11
banking, 0 22 11
finance, 0 22 11
media” 0 22 11
where 0 22 11
"their 0 22 11
influence 0 22 11
both 0 22 11
as 0 22 11
individuals 0 22 11
and 0 22 11
an 0 22 11
organized 0 22 11
community 0 22 11
far 0 22 11
exceeded 0 22 11
their 0 22 11
numbers" 0 22 11
and 0 22 11
that 0 22 11
their 0 22 11
power 0 22 11
strengthens 0 22 11
“conspiracy 0 22 11
theories 0 22 11
about 0 22 11
‘Jewish 0 22 11
control’ 0 22 11
that 0 22 11
are 0 22 11
reminiscent 0 22 11
of 0 22 11
the 0 22 11
infamous 0 22 11
“’Protocols 0 22 11
of 0 22 11
the 0 22 11
Elders 0 22 11
of 0 22 11
Zion.’” 0 22 11

Robert 0 22 12
Herbst 0 22 12
and 0 22 12
Jonathan 0 22 12
Kuttab 0 22 12
are 0 22 12
both 0 22 12
supporters 0 22 12
of 0 22 12
a 0 22 12
one-state 0 22 12
plan 0 22 12
for 0 22 12
eliminating 0 22 12
Israel. 0 22 12

The 0 22 13
American 0 22 13
Jewish 0 22 13
Historical 0 22 13
Society 0 22 13
is 0 22 13
co-sponsoring 0 22 13

event 0 22 13
by 0 22 13
two 0 22 13
opponents 0 22 13
of 0 22 13
Israel, 0 22 13
one 0 22 13
of 0 22 13
whom 0 22 13
has 0 22 13
defended 0 22 13
Hamas. 0 22 13

An 0 22 14
organization 0 22 14
that 0 22 14
hands 0 22 14
out 0 22 14
the 0 22 14
Emma 0 22 14
Lazarus 0 22 14
Award, 0 22 14
named 0 22 14
after 0 22 14
a 0 22 14
passionate 0 22 14
Zionist, 0 22 14
at 0 22 14
its 0 22 14
posh 0 22 14
dinners 0 22 14
is 0 22 14
hosting 0 22 14
attacks 0 22 14
on 0 22 14
the 0 22 14
existence 0 22 14
of 0 22 14
Israel. 0 22 14

The 0 22 15
“Jewish 0 22 15
Homeland” 0 22 15
or 0 22 15
“Jewish 0 22 15
State” 0 22 15
argument 0 22 15
is 0 22 15
a 0 22 15
hook 0 22 15
for 0 22 15
contending 0 22 15
that 0 22 15
the 0 22 15
Balfour 0 22 15
Declaration 0 22 15
didn’t 0 22 15
endorse 0 22 15
Israel, 0 22 15
but 0 22 15
some 0 22 15
sort 0 22 15
of 0 22 15
Jewish 0 22 15
Bantustan 0 22 15
within 0 22 15
a 0 22 15
Muslim 0 22 15
country. 0 22 15

That 0 22 16
worked 0 22 16
so 0 22 16
well 0 22 16
for 0 22 16
the 0 22 16
Christians 0 22 16
and 0 22 16
Jews 0 22 16
of 0 22 16
the 0 22 16
Middle 0 22 16
East. 0 22 16

The 0 22 17
American 0 22 17
Jewish 0 22 17
Historical 0 22 17
Society 0 22 17
is 0 22 17
not 0 22 17
only 0 22 17
co-sponsoring 0 22 17
a 0 22 17

by 0 22 17
an 0 22 17
anti-Israel 0 22 17
hate 0 22 17
group. 0 22 17

But 0 22 18
it’s 0 22 18
also 0 22 18
hosting 0 22 18
it 0 22 18
at 0 22 18
the 0 22 18
Center 0 22 18
for 0 22 18
Jewish 0 22 18
History’s 0 22 18

AJHS 0 22 19
is 0 22 19
a 0 22 19

And 0 22 20
the 0 22 20
partnership 0 22 20
between 0 22 20
AJHS 0 22 20
and 0 22 20
JVP 0 22 20
sheds 0 22 20
light 0 22 20
on 0 22 20
the 0 22 20
controversy 0 22 20
over 0 22 20
the 0 22 20
appointment 0 22 20
of 0 22 20
David 0 22 20
N. 0 22 20
Myers, 0 22 20
an 0 22 20
anti-Israel 0 22 20
activist, 0 22 20
to 0 22 20
head 0 22 20
the 0 22 20
Center 0 22 20
for 0 22 20
Jewish 0 22 20
History. 0 22 20

During 0 22 21
the 0 22 21
Myers 0 22 21
controversy, 0 22 21
the 0 22 21
Center 0 22 21
took 0 22 21
pains 0 22 21
to 0 22 21
disassociate 0 22 21
Myers 0 22 21
and 0 22 21
themselves 0 22 21
from 0 22 21
JVP 0 22 21
because 0 22 21
a 0 22 21
JVP 0 22 21
handout 0 22 21
had 0 22 21
listed 0 22 21
him 0 22 21
as 0 22 21
a 0 22 21
“JVP 0 22 21
Academic 0 22 21
Advisory 0 22 21
Board 0 22 21
Member.” 0 22 21
But 0 22 21
in 0 22 21
reality 0 22 21
the 0 22 21
Center, 0 22 21
through 0 22 21
AJHS, 0 22 21
has 0 22 21
an 0 22 21
ongoing 0 22 21
relationship 0 22 21
with 0 22 21
JVP. 0 22 21

The 0 22 22
Balfour 0 22 22
event 0 22 22
was 0 22 22
not 0 22 22
AJHS’ 0 22 22
only 0 22 22
partnership 0 22 22
with 0 22 22
JVP. 0 22 22

In 0 22 23
December, 0 22 23
the 0 22 23
AJHS 0 22 23
will 0 22 23
feature 0 22 23
“Rubble 0 22 23
Rubble”, 0 22 23
a 0 22 23
play 0 22 23
by 0 22 23
Dan 0 22 23
Fishback 0 22 23
based 0 22 23
on 0 22 23
his 0 22 23
trip 0 22 23
to 0 22 23
Israel. 0 22 23

Fishback 0 22 24
is 0 22 24
a 0 22 24
BDS 0 22 24
supporter 0 22 24
and 0 22 24
a 0 22 24
member 0 22 24
of 0 22 24
the 0 22 24
JVP 0 22 24
Artists 0 22 24
Council. 0 22 24

His 0 22 25
goal 0 22 25
is 0 22 25
to 0 22 25
“normalize 0 22 25
Jewish 0 22 25
anti-Zionism”. 0 22 25

AJHS 0 22 26
and 0 22 26
JVP 0 22 26
members 0 22 26
get 0 22 26
discounted 0 22 26
admission. 0 22 26

The 0 22 27
venue 0 22 27
is 0 22 27
once 0 22 27
again 0 22 27
the 0 22 27
Center 0 22 27
for 0 22 27
Jewish 0 22 27
History. 0 22 27

Specifically 0 22 28
the 0 22 28
Leo 0 22 28
and 0 22 28
Julia 0 22 28
Forchheimer 0 22 28

at 0 22 28
CJH. 0 22 28

Leo 0 22 29
Forchheimer’s 0 22 29
philanthropy 0 22 29
had 0 22 29
left 0 22 29
its 0 22 29
mark 0 22 29
on 0 22 29
Israel. 0 22 29

What 0 22 30
would 0 22 30
he 0 22 30
think 0 22 30
if 0 22 30
he 0 22 30
knew 0 22 30
the 0 22 30
anti-Israel 0 22 30
purposes 0 22 30
that 0 22 30
CJH 0 22 30
is 0 22 30
putting 0 22 30
his 0 22 30
gift 0 22 30
to? 0 22 30

A 0 22 31
third 0 22 31
AJHS-JVP 0 22 31
event 0 22 31
featured 0 22 31
Efrat 0 22 31
Yerday, 0 22 31
an 1 22 31
anti-Israel 1 22 31
activist, 0 22 31
accusing 0 22 31
Israel 0 22 31
of 0 22 31
racism. 0 22 31

Efrat 0 22 32
has 0 22 32
claimed 0 22 32
that, 0 22 32
"Zionism 1 22 32
does 1 22 32
not 1 22 32
only 1 22 32
dispossess 1 22 32
Palestinians, 1 22 32
but 1 22 32
it 1 22 32
also 1 22 32
dispossesses 1 22 32
in 1 22 32
a 1 22 32
very 1 22 32
sophisticated 1 22 32
way, 1 22 32
non-white 1 22 32
Jews. 1 22 32

Being 1 22 33
Jewish 1 22 33
is 1 22 33
highly 1 22 33
identified 1 22 33
with 1 22 33
being 1 22 33
white 1 22 33
because 1 22 33
of 1 22 33
Zionism." 1 22 33

AJHS 0 22 34
will 0 22 34
claim 0 22 34
that 0 22 34
it 0 22 34
is 0 22 34
only 0 22 34
offering 0 22 34
different 0 22 34
perspectives. 0 22 34

But 0 22 35
when 0 22 35
it 0 22 35
comes 0 22 35
to 0 22 35
Israel, 0 22 35
there’s 0 22 35
only 0 22 35
one 0 22 35
perspective. 0 22 35

“Balfour” 0 22 36
and 0 22 36
“Rubble 0 22 36
Rubble” 0 22 36
are 0 22 36
to 0 22 36
be 0 22 36
part 0 22 36
of 0 22 36
AJHS’ 0 22 36
“1917: 0 22 36
How 0 22 36

World”. 0 22 36

The 0 22 37
exhibition 0 22 37
is 0 22 37
supposed 0 22 37
to 0 22 37
cover 0 22 37
WWI, 0 22 37
the 0 22 37
Bolshevik 0 22 37
Revolution, 0 22 37
and 0 22 37
the 0 22 37
Balfour 0 22 37
Declaration. 0 22 37

But 0 22 38
the 0 22 38
only 0 22 38
Balfour 0 22 38
program 0 22 38
on 0 22 38
the 0 22 38
list 0 22 38
questions 0 22 38
whether 0 22 38
Israel 0 22 38
should 0 22 38
even 0 22 38
exist. 0 22 38

The 0 22 39
exhibition 0 22 39
closes 0 22 39
with 0 22 39
Fishback’s 0 22 39
anti-Israel 0 22 39
agenda. 0 22 39

And 0 22 40
these 0 22 40
are 0 22 40
the 0 22 40
only 0 22 40
listed 0 22 40
AJHS 0 22 40
programs 0 22 40
that 0 22 40
focus 0 22 40
on 0 22 40
Israel. 0 22 40

JVP 0 22 41
is 0 22 41
also 0 22 41
the 0 22 41
only 0 22 41
organization 0 22 41
that 0 22 41
AJHS 0 22 41
chooses 0 22 41
to 0 22 41
partner 0 22 41
with 0 22 41
on 0 22 41
political 0 22 41

The 0 22 42
American 0 22 42
Jewish 0 22 42

in 0 22 42
holding 0 22 42
any 0 22 42
pro-Israel 0 22 42

It’s 0 22 43
uninterested 0 22 43
in 0 22 43
partnering 0 22 43
with 0 22 43
pro-Israel 0 22 43
groups. 0 22 43

Instead 0 22 44
it’s 0 22 44
providing 0 22 44
a 0 22 44
forum 0 22 44
for 0 22 44
a 0 22 44

it’s 0 22 45
no 0 22 45

why. 0 22 45

When 0 22 52
we 0 22 52
look 0 22 52
at 0 22 52
what 0 22 52
is 0 22 52
going 0 22 52
on 0 22 52
in 0 22 52
CJH’s 0 22 52
components 0 22 52
like 0 22 52
the 0 22 52
AJHS, 0 22 52
the 0 22 52
elevation 0 22 52
of 0 22 52
David 0 22 52
N. 0 22 52
Myers 0 22 52
to 0 22 52
head 0 22 52
CJH 0 22 52
is 0 22 52
unsurprising. 0 22 52

Myers 0 22 53
is 0 22 53
a 0 22 53
symptom 0 22 53
of 0 22 53
the 0 22 53
problem. 0 22 53

As 0 22 54
is 0 22 54
AJHS’s 0 22 54
partnership 0 22 54
with 0 22 54
JVP. 0 22 54

A 0 22 55
great 0 22 55
deal 0 22 55
of 0 22 55
shocking 0 22 55
behavior 0 22 55
is 0 22 55
taking 0 22 55
place 0 22 55
inside 0 22 55
Jewish 0 22 55
organizations 0 22 55
whose 0 22 55
inner 0 22 55
workings 0 22 55
most 0 22 55
people 0 22 55
in 0 22 55
the 0 22 55
Jewish 0 22 55
community 0 22 55
generally 0 22 55
pay 0 22 55
very 0 22 55
little 0 22 55
attention 0 22 55
to. 0 22 55

Unlike 0 22 56
CJH, 0 22 56
the 0 22 56
American 0 22 56
Jewish 0 22 56
Historical 0 22 56
Society 0 22 56
is 0 22 56
an 0 22 56
organization 0 22 56
that 0 22 56
dates 0 22 56
back 0 22 56
to 0 22 56
the 0 22 56
19th 0 22 56
century. 0 22 56

Its 1 22 57
perversion 1 22 57
by 0 22 57
the 0 22 57
radical 0 22 57
anti-Jewish 0 22 57
and 0 22 57
anti-Israel 0 22 57
left 0 22 57
to 0 22 57
serve 0 22 57
anti-Semitic 0 22 57
narratives 0 22 57
is 0 22 57
tragic. 0 22 57

And 0 22 58
yet 0 22 58
it’s 0 22 58
inescapable. 0 22 58

Even 0 22 59
as 0 22 59
the 0 22 59
Myers 0 22 59
scandal 0 22 59
continues 0 22 59
to 0 22 59
simmer, 1 22 59
the 0 22 59
AJHS 0 22 59
partnership 0 22 59
with 0 22 59
JVP 0 22 59
is 0 22 59
making 0 22 59
the 0 22 59
choice 0 22 59
painfully 0 22 59
clear. 0 22 59

The 0 22 60
radical 0 22 60
anti-Israel 0 22 60
left 0 22 60
will 0 22 60
not 0 22 60
be 0 22 60
satisfied 0 22 60
with 0 22 60
embedding 0 22 60
“moderate” 0 22 60
opposing 0 22 60
voices 0 22 60
into 0 22 60
Jewish 0 22 60
organizations. 0 22 60

Instead 0 22 61
it 0 22 61
seeks 0 22 61
to 0 22 61
normalize 0 22 61
the 0 22 61
furthest 0 22 61
extremes 0 22 61
of 0 22 61
anti-Israel 0 22 61
hatred. 0 22 61

And 0 22 62
it 0 22 62
will 0 22 62
not 0 22 62
be 0 22 62
satisfied 0 22 62
with 0 22 62
anything 0 22 62
less. 0 22 62

During 0 22 63
the 0 22 63
Myers 0 22 63
controversy, 0 22 63
defenders 0 22 63
of 0 22 63
his 0 22 63
appointment, 0 22 63
including 0 22 63
some 0 22 63
figures 0 22 63
named 0 22 63
here, 0 22 63
claimed 0 22 63
that 0 22 63
it 0 22 63
was 0 22 63
an 0 22 63
issue 0 22 63
of 0 22 63
apolitical 0 22 63
scholarship. 0 22 63

Is 0 22 64
co-sponsoring 0 22 64
events 0 22 64
with 0 22 64
a 0 22 64
hate 0 22 64
group 0 22 64
that 0 22 64
has 0 22 64
sponsored 0 22 64
talks 0 22 64
by 0 22 64
a 0 22 64
woman 0 22 64
who 0 22 64
accused 1 22 64
Jews 1 22 64
of 1 22 64
drinking 1 22 64
blood 1 22 64
also 0 22 64
apolitical 0 22 64
scholarship? 0 22 64

The 0 22 65
anti-Israel 0 22 65
leftists 0 22 65
at 0 22 65
the 0 22 65
AJHS 0 22 65
are 0 22 65
clearly 0 22 65
not 0 22 65
leaving 0 22 65
their 0 22 65
politics 0 22 65
at 0 22 65
home. 0 22 65

And 0 22 66
support 0 22 66
for 0 22 66
them 0 22 66
and 0 22 66
for 0 22 66
Myers 0 22 66
cannot 0 22 66
be 0 22 66
distinguished 0 22 66
from 0 22 66
support 0 22 66
for 0 22 66
their 0 22 66
views. 0 22 66

Not 0 22 67
when 0 22 67
JVP 0 22 67
is 0 22 67
at 0 22 67
AJHS. 0 22 67

We 1 22 68
all 1 22 68
have 1 22 68
choices 1 22 68
to 1 22 68
make. 1 22 68

Sometimes 0 22 69
the 0 22 69
choices 0 22 69
are 0 22 69
murky. 0 22 69

Other 0 22 70
times 0 22 70
they 0 22 70
are 0 22 70
simple 0 22 70
and 0 22 70
easy. 0 22 70

When 0 22 71
the 0 22 71
American 0 22 71
Jewish 0 22 71
Historical 0 22 71
Society 0 22 71
hosts 0 22 71
and 0 22 71
co-sponsors 0 22 71
an 0 22 71
event 0 22 71
by 0 22 71
a 0 22 71
BDS 0 22 71
hate 0 22 71
group 0 22 71
attacking 0 22 71
the 0 22 71
existence 0 22 71
of 0 22 71
Israel 0 22 71
and 0 22 71
featuring 0 22 71
a 0 22 71
speaker 0 22 71
who 0 22 71
had 0 22 71
defended 0 22 71
terrorism 0 22 71
and 0 22 71
anti-Semitism, 0 22 71
the 0 22 71
choice 0 22 71
becomes 0 22 71
easy. 0 22 71

Either 1 22 72
you 1 22 72
stand 1 22 72
with 1 22 72
BDS, 1 22 72
Hamas, 1 22 72
blood 1 22 72
libels 1 22 72
and 1 22 72
those 1 22 72
who 1 22 72
want 1 22 72
to 1 22 72
destroy 1 22 72
Israel 1 22 72
or 1 22 72
with 1 22 72
Jews. 1 22 72

As 0 22 73
the 0 22 73
anti-Israel 0 22 73
radicalism 0 22 73
of 0 22 73
the 0 22 73
left 0 22 73
grows, 0 22 73
such 0 22 73
choices 0 22 73
will 0 22 73
become 0 22 73
even 0 22 73
more 0 22 73
obscenely 0 22 73
simple. 0 22 73

But 0 22 74
they 0 22 74
will 0 22 74
not 0 22 74
be 0 22 74
any 0 22 74
less 0 22 74
difficult. 0 22 74

Opposing 0 22 75
the 0 22 75
anti-Israel 0 22 75
left 0 22 75
makes 0 22 75
many 0 22 75
important 0 22 75
enemies 0 22 75
and 0 22 75
wins 0 22 75
few 0 22 75
friends. 0 22 75

The 0 22 76
anti-Israel 0 22 76
left 0 22 76
has 0 22 76
built 0 22 76
networks 0 22 76
that 0 22 76
can 0 22 76
blacklist, 0 22 76
smear 0 22 76
and 0 22 76
silence 0 22 76
almost 0 22 76
anyone 0 22 76
in 0 22 76
an 0 22 76
academic 0 22 76
field. 0 22 76

Speaking 0 22 77
out 0 22 77
against 0 22 77
hate 0 22 77
is 0 22 77
easiest 0 22 77
when 0 22 77
it’s 0 22 77
weakest. 0 22 77

It’s 0 22 78
hardest 0 22 78
when 0 22 78
it’s 0 22 78
strongest. 0 22 78

When 0 22 79
we 0 22 79
think 0 22 79
about 0 22 79
Nazi 0 22 79
Germany, 0 22 79
we 0 22 79
remember 0 22 79
those 0 22 79
who 0 22 79
spoke 0 22 79
out. 0 22 79

We 0 22 80
don’t 0 22 80
remember 0 22 80
those 0 22 80
who 0 22 80
were 0 22 80
too 0 22 80
intimidated 0 22 80
and 0 22 80
uncertain 0 22 80
to 0 22 80
rise 0 22 80
against 0 22 80
anti-Semitism 0 22 80
when 0 22 80
they 0 22 80
saw 0 22 80
it 0 22 80
and 0 22 80
heard 0 22 80
it. 0 22 80

History 0 22 81
tells 0 22 81
us 0 22 81
why 0 22 81
so 0 22 81
many 0 22 81
people 0 22 81
are 0 22 81
afraid 0 22 81
to 0 22 81
do 0 22 81
the 0 22 81
right 0 22 81
thing 0 22 81
when 0 22 81
it 0 22 81
counts. 0 22 81

It 0 22 82
also 0 22 82
tells 0 22 82
us 0 22 82
how 0 22 82
irrelevant 0 22 82
history 0 22 82
makes 0 22 82
them. 0 22 82

about 0 22 83
