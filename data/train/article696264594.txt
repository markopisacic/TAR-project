He 0 104 7
had 0 104 7
tweeted, 0 104 7
"EU 1 104 7
no 1 104 7

to 1 104 8

same." 1 104 8

Kuttab 0 104 9
has 0 104 9
defended 0 104 9
Islamic 0 104 9
anti-Semitism 0 104 9
by 0 104 9
claiming 0 104 9
that 0 104 9
the 0 104 9
“distrust 0 104 9
Moslems 0 104 9
feel 0 104 9
towards 0 104 9
Jews” 0 104 9
is 0 104 9
due 0 104 9
to 0 104 9
“two 0 104 9
acts 0 104 9
of 0 104 9

tribes 0 104 9
against 0 104 9

Prophet.” 0 104 9
And 0 104 9
that 0 104 9
Jews 0 104 9
suffer 0 104 9
from 0 104 9
a 0 104 9
“Holocaust 1 104 9
Syndrome” 1 104 9
of 1 104 9
entitlement. 1 104 9

He 0 104 10
justified 0 104 10
hijacking 0 104 10
planes, 0 104 10
described 0 104 10
suicide 0 104 10
bombers 0 104 10

“taking 0 104 10
the 0 104 10

as 1 104 10
“an 1 104 10

He 0 104 11
has 0 104 11
claimed 0 104 11
that 0 104 11
the 0 104 11

and 0 104 11
that 0 104 11
their 0 104 11

or 0 104 15
“Jewish 0 104 15

is 0 104 15
a 0 104 15
hook 0 104 15

that 0 104 15
the 0 104 15

the 0 104 21

the 0 104 21

Myers 0 104 21
and 0 104 21
themselves 0 104 21

a 0 104 21

A 0 104 31
third 0 104 31
AJHS-JVP 0 104 31
event 0 104 31
featured 0 104 31
Efrat 0 104 31
Yerday, 0 104 31
an 1 104 31
anti-Israel 1 104 31
activist, 0 104 31
accusing 0 104 31
Israel 0 104 31
of 0 104 31
racism. 0 104 31

Efrat 0 104 32
has 0 104 32
claimed 0 104 32
that, 0 104 32
"Zionism 1 104 32
does 1 104 32
not 1 104 32
only 1 104 32
dispossess 1 104 32
Palestinians, 1 104 32
but 1 104 32
it 1 104 32
also 1 104 32
dispossesses 1 104 32
in 1 104 32
a 1 104 32
very 1 104 32
sophisticated 1 104 32
way, 1 104 32
non-white 1 104 32
Jews. 1 104 32

Being 1 104 33
Jewish 1 104 33
is 1 104 33
highly 1 104 33
identified 1 104 33
with 1 104 33
being 1 104 33
white 1 104 33
because 1 104 33
of 1 104 33
Zionism." 1 104 33

AJHS 0 104 34
will 0 104 34
claim 0 104 34
that 0 104 34
it 0 104 34
is 0 104 34
only 0 104 34
offering 0 104 34
different 0 104 34
perspectives. 0 104 34

But 0 104 35
when 0 104 35
it 0 104 35
comes 0 104 35
to 0 104 35
Israel, 0 104 35
there’s 0 104 35
only 0 104 35
one 0 104 35
perspective. 0 104 35

“Balfour” 0 104 36
and 0 104 36
“Rubble 0 104 36

But 0 104 38
the 0 104 38
only 0 104 38

program 0 104 38
on 0 104 38
the 0 104 38
list 0 104 38
questions 0 104 38
whether 0 104 38

even 0 104 38
exist. 0 104 38

The 0 104 39

closes 0 104 39
with 0 104 39
Fishback’s 0 104 39
anti-Israel 0 104 39
agenda. 0 104 39

And 0 104 40
these 0 104 40
are 0 104 40
the 0 104 40
only 0 104 40
listed 0 104 40
AJHS 0 104 40
programs 0 104 40
that 0 104 40

JVP 0 104 41
is 0 104 41
also 0 104 41
the 0 104 41
only 0 104 41

that 0 104 41
AJHS 0 104 41

to 0 104 41
partner 0 104 41
with 0 104 41

The 0 104 42
American 0 104 42
Jewish 0 104 42
Historical 0 104 42

in 0 104 42
holding 0 104 42
any 0 104 42

It’s 0 104 43
uninterested 0 104 43
in 0 104 43
partnering 0 104 43
with 0 104 43
pro-Israel 0 104 43

Instead 0 104 44
it’s 0 104 44
providing 0 104 44

for 0 104 44
a 0 104 44

And 0 104 45
it’s 0 104 45
no 0 104 45

When 0 104 52
we 0 104 52
look 0 104 52
at 0 104 52
what 0 104 52
is 0 104 52
going 0 104 52
on 0 104 52
in 0 104 52
CJH’s 0 104 52
components 0 104 52
like 0 104 52
the 0 104 52
AJHS, 0 104 52
the 0 104 52
elevation 0 104 52
of 0 104 52
David 0 104 52
N. 0 104 52
Myers 0 104 52
to 0 104 52
head 0 104 52
CJH 0 104 52
is 0 104 52
unsurprising. 0 104 52

Myers 0 104 53
is 0 104 53
a 0 104 53
symptom 0 104 53
of 0 104 53
the 0 104 53
problem. 0 104 53

As 0 104 54
is 0 104 54
AJHS’s 0 104 54
partnership 0 104 54
with 0 104 54
JVP. 0 104 54

A 0 104 55
great 0 104 55
deal 0 104 55
of 0 104 55
shocking 0 104 55
behavior 0 104 55
is 0 104 55
taking 0 104 55
place 0 104 55
inside 0 104 55
Jewish 0 104 55
organizations 0 104 55
whose 0 104 55
inner 0 104 55
workings 0 104 55
most 0 104 55
people 0 104 55
in 0 104 55
the 0 104 55
Jewish 0 104 55
community 0 104 55
generally 0 104 55
pay 0 104 55
very 0 104 55
little 0 104 55
attention 0 104 55
to. 0 104 55

Unlike 0 104 56
CJH, 0 104 56
the 0 104 56
American 0 104 56
Jewish 0 104 56
Historical 0 104 56
Society 0 104 56
is 0 104 56
an 0 104 56
organization 0 104 56
that 0 104 56
dates 0 104 56
back 0 104 56
to 0 104 56
the 0 104 56
19th 0 104 56
century. 0 104 56

Its 1 104 57
perversion 1 104 57
by 0 104 57
the 0 104 57
radical 0 104 57
anti-Jewish 0 104 57
and 0 104 57
anti-Israel 0 104 57
left 0 104 57
to 0 104 57
serve 0 104 57
anti-Semitic 0 104 57
narratives 0 104 57
is 0 104 57
tragic. 0 104 57

And 0 104 58
yet 0 104 58
it’s 0 104 58
inescapable. 0 104 58

Even 0 104 59
as 0 104 59
the 0 104 59
Myers 0 104 59
scandal 0 104 59
continues 0 104 59
to 0 104 59
simmer, 1 104 59
the 0 104 59
AJHS 0 104 59
partnership 0 104 59
with 0 104 59
JVP 0 104 59
is 0 104 59
making 0 104 59
the 0 104 59
choice 0 104 59
painfully 0 104 59
clear. 0 104 59

The 0 104 60
radical 0 104 60
anti-Israel 0 104 60
left 0 104 60
will 0 104 60
not 0 104 60
be 0 104 60
satisfied 0 104 60
with 0 104 60
embedding 0 104 60
“moderate” 0 104 60
opposing 0 104 60
voices 0 104 60
into 0 104 60
Jewish 0 104 60
organizations. 0 104 60

Instead 0 104 61
it 0 104 61
seeks 0 104 61
to 0 104 61
normalize 0 104 61
the 0 104 61
furthest 0 104 61
extremes 0 104 61
of 0 104 61
anti-Israel 0 104 61
hatred. 0 104 61

And 0 104 62
it 0 104 62
will 0 104 62
not 0 104 62
be 0 104 62
satisfied 0 104 62
with 0 104 62
anything 0 104 62
less. 0 104 62

During 0 104 63
the 0 104 63
Myers 0 104 63
controversy, 0 104 63
defenders 0 104 63
of 0 104 63
his 0 104 63
appointment, 0 104 63
including 0 104 63
some 0 104 63
figures 0 104 63
named 0 104 63
here, 0 104 63
claimed 0 104 63
that 0 104 63
it 0 104 63
was 0 104 63
an 0 104 63
issue 0 104 63
of 0 104 63
apolitical 0 104 63
scholarship. 0 104 63

Is 0 104 64
co-sponsoring 0 104 64
events 0 104 64
with 0 104 64
a 0 104 64
hate 0 104 64

that 0 104 64
has 0 104 64

talks 0 104 64
by 0 104 64
a 0 104 64
woman 0 104 64
who 0 104 64
accused 1 104 64
Jews 1 104 64
of 1 104 64
drinking 1 104 64
blood 1 104 64
also 0 104 64
apolitical 0 104 64
scholarship? 0 104 64

The 0 104 65
anti-Israel 0 104 65
leftists 0 104 65
at 0 104 65
the 0 104 65
AJHS 0 104 65
are 0 104 65
clearly 0 104 65
not 0 104 65
leaving 0 104 65
their 0 104 65
politics 0 104 65
at 0 104 65
home. 0 104 65

And 0 104 66
support 0 104 66
for 0 104 66
them 0 104 66
and 0 104 66
for 0 104 66
Myers 0 104 66
cannot 0 104 66
be 0 104 66
distinguished 0 104 66
from 0 104 66
support 0 104 66
for 0 104 66
their 0 104 66
views. 0 104 66

Not 0 104 67
when 0 104 67
JVP 0 104 67
is 0 104 67
at 0 104 67
AJHS. 0 104 67

We 1 104 68
all 1 104 68
have 1 104 68
choices 1 104 68
to 1 104 68
make. 1 104 68

Sometimes 0 104 69
the 0 104 69
choices 0 104 69
are 0 104 69
murky. 0 104 69

Other 0 104 70
times 0 104 70
they 0 104 70
are 0 104 70
simple 0 104 70
and 0 104 70
easy. 0 104 70

When 0 104 71
the 0 104 71
American 0 104 71
Jewish 0 104 71
Historical 0 104 71
Society 0 104 71
hosts 0 104 71
and 0 104 71
co-sponsors 0 104 71
an 0 104 71
event 0 104 71
by 0 104 71
a 0 104 71
BDS 0 104 71
hate 0 104 71
group 0 104 71
attacking 0 104 71
the 0 104 71
existence 0 104 71
of 0 104 71
Israel 0 104 71
and 0 104 71
featuring 0 104 71
a 0 104 71
speaker 0 104 71
who 0 104 71
had 0 104 71
defended 0 104 71
terrorism 0 104 71
and 0 104 71
anti-Semitism, 0 104 71
the 0 104 71
choice 0 104 71
becomes 0 104 71
easy. 0 104 71

Either 1 104 72
you 1 104 72
stand 1 104 72
with 1 104 72
BDS, 1 104 72
Hamas, 1 104 72
blood 1 104 72
libels 1 104 72
and 1 104 72
those 1 104 72
who 1 104 72
want 1 104 72
to 1 104 72
destroy 1 104 72
Israel 1 104 72
or 1 104 72
with 1 104 72
Jews. 1 104 72

As 0 104 73
the 0 104 73
anti-Israel 0 104 73
radicalism 0 104 73
of 0 104 73
the 0 104 73
left 0 104 73
grows, 0 104 73
such 0 104 73
choices 0 104 73
will 0 104 73
become 0 104 73
even 0 104 73
more 0 104 73
obscenely 0 104 73
simple. 0 104 73

But 0 104 74
they 0 104 74
will 0 104 74
not 0 104 74
be 0 104 74
any 0 104 74
less 0 104 74
difficult. 0 104 74

Opposing 0 104 75
the 0 104 75
anti-Israel 0 104 75
left 0 104 75
makes 0 104 75
many 0 104 75
important 0 104 75
enemies 0 104 75
and 0 104 75
wins 0 104 75
few 0 104 75
friends. 0 104 75

The 0 104 76
anti-Israel 0 104 76
left 0 104 76
has 0 104 76
built 0 104 76
networks 0 104 76
that 0 104 76
can 0 104 76
blacklist, 0 104 76
smear 0 104 76
and 0 104 76
silence 0 104 76
almost 0 104 76
anyone 0 104 76
in 0 104 76
an 0 104 76
academic 0 104 76
field. 0 104 76

Speaking 0 104 77
out 0 104 77
against 0 104 77
hate 0 104 77
is 0 104 77
easiest 0 104 77
when 0 104 77
it’s 0 104 77
weakest. 0 104 77

It’s 0 104 78
hardest 0 104 78
when 0 104 78
it’s 0 104 78
strongest. 0 104 78

When 0 104 79
we 0 104 79
think 0 104 79
about 0 104 79
Nazi 0 104 79
Germany, 0 104 79
we 0 104 79
remember 0 104 79
those 0 104 79
who 0 104 79
spoke 0 104 79
out. 0 104 79

We 0 104 80
don’t 0 104 80
remember 0 104 80
those 0 104 80
who 0 104 80
were 0 104 80
too 0 104 80
intimidated 0 104 80
and 0 104 80
uncertain 0 104 80
to 0 104 80
rise 0 104 80
against 0 104 80
anti-Semitism 0 104 80
when 0 104 80
they 0 104 80
saw 0 104 80
it 0 104 80
and 0 104 80
heard 0 104 80
it. 0 104 80

History 0 104 81
tells 0 104 81
us 0 104 81
why 0 104 81
so 0 104 81
many 0 104 81
people 0 104 81
are 0 104 81
afraid 0 104 81
to 0 104 81
do 0 104 81
the 0 104 81
right 0 104 81
thing 0 104 81
when 0 104 81
it 0 104 81
counts. 0 104 81

It 0 104 82
also 0 104 82
tells 0 104 82
us 0 104 82
how 0 104 82
irrelevant 0 104 82
history 0 104 82
makes 0 104 82
them. 0 104 82

There 0 104 83
are 0 104 83
lessons 0 104 83
here 0 104 83
for 0 104 83
the 0 104 83

the 0 104 83

for 0 104 83
those 0 104 83
on 0 104 83
the 0 104 83
inside 0 104 83
who 0 104 83
see 0 104 83
the 0 104 83
corruption 0 104 83
of 0 104 83
their 0 104 83

every 0 104 83
