The 0
Sun 0
is 0
getting 0
cooler 0
and 0
dimmer, 0
but 1
scientists 1
aren’t 1
worried 1

In 0
what 0
is 0
being 0
considered 0
a 0
particularly 0
rare 0
event, 0
scientists 0
are 0
projecting 0
that 0
the 0
Sun 0
will 0
be 0
an 0
unusually 0
cool 0
customer 0
by 0
the 0
year 0
2050. 0

By 0
combining 0
data 0
and 0
observations 0
from 0
decades 0
of 0
Sun 0
research, 0
experts 0
are 0
predicting 0
a 0
“Grand 0
Solar 0
Minimum” 0
will 0
occur 0
a 0
few 0
decades 0
from 0
now, 0
making 0
our 0
parent 0
star 0
dimmer 0
and 0
cooler 0
than 0
it 0
has 0
been 0
for 0
a 0
very 0
long 0
time. 0

The 0
Sun 0
might 0
look 0
the 0
same 0
to 0
you 0
today 0
as 0
it 0
has 0
since 0
the 0
first 0
time 0
you 0
laid 0
eyes 0
on 0
it, 0
but 0
our 0
star 0
actually 0
displays 0
plenty 0
of 0
changes. 0

The 0
Sun 0
goes 0
through 0
regular 0
cycles 0
of 0
solar 0
minimums 0
and 0
solar 0
maximums, 0
which 0
are 0
periods 0
where 0
the 0
Sun 0
is 0
either 0
quite 0
calm 0
(the 0
minimum) 0
or 0
incredibly 0
active 0
(the 0
maximum). 0

These 0
patterns 0
repeat 0
every 0
11 0
years 0
or 0
so, 0
but 0
new 0
research 0
suggests 0
that 0
there’s 0
a 0
pattern 0
behind 0
the 0
pattern, 0
and 0
that 0
a 0
particularly 0
cool 0
solar 0
minimum 0
is 0
on 0
the 0
way. 0

The 0
study, 0
which 0
was 0
published 0
in 0
Astrophysical 0
Journal 0
Letters, 0
was 0
carried 0
out 0
by 0
a 0
team 0
led 0
by 0
physicist 0
Dan 0
Lubin 0
of 0
the 0
University 0
of 0
California, 0
San 0
Diego. 0

After 0
combing 0
the 0
data, 0
Lubin’s 0
team 0
has 0
forecasted 0
a 0
grand 0
minimum 0
that 0
will 0
be 0
around 0
seven 0
percent 0
cooler 0
than 0
the 0
typical 0
solar 0
minimum, 0
making 0
it 0
a 0
particularly 0
calm 0
moment 0
for 0
our 0
star. 0

During 0
a 0
solar 0
minimum, 0
the 0
Sun 0
produces 0
far 0
fewer 0
solar 0
flares 0
and 0
sunspots, 0
and 0
as 0
a 0
result, 0
much 0
less 0
ultraviolet 0
radiation 0
is 0
shot 0
out 0
into 0
space 0
and 0
towards 0
Earth. 0

This 0
can 0
have 0
a 0
number 0
of 0
effects 0
on 0
our 0
planet, 0
including 0
changes 0
in 0
the 0
thickness 0
of 0
the 0
stratospheric 0
ozone 0
layer 0
and 0
temperatures 0
far 0
above 0
ground. 0

Those 0
changes 0
can 0
affect 0
weather, 0
though 0
forecasting 0
specific 0
differences 0
has 0
proven 0
difficult. 0

The 0
grand 0
minimum 0
will 0
be 0
an 0
exaggerated 0
version 0
of 0
the 0
typical 0
solar 0
minimum, 0
and 0
could 0
produce 0
some 0
very 0
noticeable 0
effects. 0

The 0
most 0
recent 0
grand 0
minimum 0
is 0
thought 0
to 0
have 0
occurred 0
back 0
in 0
the 0
mid 0
1600s. 0

The 0
event, 0
called 0
the 0
Maunder 0
Minimum, 0
is 0
credited 0
with 0
plunging 0
temperatures 0
to 0
the 0
point 0
where 0
the 0
Thames 0
River 0
and 0
Baltic 0
Sea 0
froze 0
over. 0

However, 0
other 0
parts 0
of 0
the 0
planet 0
heated 0
up, 0
including 0
Alaska 0
and 0
Greenland, 0
to 0
far 0
above 0
their 0
normal 0
highs. 0

This 0
temporary 0
shakeup 0
of 0
temperatures 0
could 0
happen 0
again, 0
though 0
the 0
researchers 1
say 1
it 1
will 1
have 1
very 1
little 1
effect 1
on 1
the 1
overall 1
global 1
warming 1
trend 1
that 1
mankind 1
has 1
created 1
for 1
itself. 1
