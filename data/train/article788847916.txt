During 0

as 0

“I 0
can’t 0
do 0
that 0
because 0
there 0
are 0
both 0
local, 0
state 0
and 0
federal 0
laws 0
that 0
prohibit 0
me 0
from 0
taking 0
action. 0

There 0
are 0
civil 0
service 0
laws 0
we 0
have 0
to 0
adhere 0
to,” 0
said 0
Hall. 0

But 0
experts 0
say 0
this 0
is 0
not 0
true. 0

As 0
WFAA 0
reports, 0
Justin 0
Moore, 0
a 0
civil 0
rights 0
attorney 0
was 0
a 0
panelist 0
at 0
the 0
meeting 0
and 0
was 0
surprised 0
by 0
the 0
Chief’s 0
comments. 0

“I 0
was 0
completely 0
mystified, 0
and 0
I 0
really 0
didn’t 0
understand 0
where 0
it 0
came 0
from 0
last 0
night. 0

It 0
seemed 0
like 0
Chief 1
Hall 1
might 1
not 1
have 1
been 1
well 1
informed 1
on 1
the 1
law,” 1
said 0
Moore. 0

WFAA 0
went 0
further 0
and 0
noted 0
that 0
the 0
“the 0
Dallas 0
Police 0
Department 0
general 0
orders 0
do 0
allow 0
the 0
chief 0
to 0
take 0
action, 0
saying, 0
‘The 0
Chief 0
of 0
Police 0
may 0
circumvent 0
all 0
formal 0
disciplinary 0
procedures 0
to 0
render 0
an 0
immediate 0
decision 0
when 0
it 0
deems 0
it 0
necessary 0
to 0
preserve 0
the 0
integrity 0
of 0
the 0
department.’” 0

Apparently, 0
this 0
“integrity” 0
is 0
not 0
worth 0
preserving 0
and 0
the 0
Dallas 0
police 0
are 0
going 0
out 0
of 0
their 0
way 0
to 0
keep 0
a 0
killer 1
cop 1
on 0
their 0
payroll. 0

As 0
WFAA 0
pointed 0
out, 0
lots 0
of 0
cops 0
across 0
the 0
state 0
who 0
have 0
been 0
under 0
criminal 0
investigation 0
have 0
been 0
fired 0
by 0
police 0
chiefs. 0

This 0
includes 0
cops 0
within 0
the 0
Dallas 0
police 0
department. 0

Amy 0
Wilburn, 0
a 0
former 0
Dallas 1
cop 1
shot 1
an 1
unarmed 1
teen 1
in 0
the 0
stomach 0
as 0
he 0
sat 0
down 0
with 0
his 0
hands 0
in 0
the 0
air 0
in 0
2013. 0

Days 0
later, 0
after 0
her 0
account 0
was 0
found 0
to 0
be 0
entirely 0
false, 0
she 0
was 0
fired 0
for 0
it. 0

Wilburn 0
became 0
the 0
first 0
cop 0
in 0
41 0
years 0
— 0
since 0
officer 1
Darrell 1
Cain 1
murdered 1
a 1
12-year-old 1
boy 1
in 0
the 0
back 0
of 0
his 0
squad 0
car 0
— 0
to 0
be 0
indicted 0
for 0
shooting 0
a 0
suspect. 0

Also 0
in 0
2013, 0
officer 1
Cardan 1
Spencer 1
shot 1
a 1
mentally 1
ill 1
man 1
in 0
his 0
driveway. 0

Days 0
later, 0
he 0
was 0
also 0
fired 0
after 0
surveillance 0
video 0
proved 0
he 0
was 0
lying 0
about 0
what 0
happened. 0

So 0
why 0
hasn’t 0
the 0
chief 0
fired 0
Gugyer, 0
who 0
has 0
actually 0
been 0
charged, 0
arrested, 0
and 0
admitted 0
to 0
killing 0
an 0
innocent 1
man? 0

Like 0
all 0
those 0
accused 0
of 0
a 0
crime, 0
Amber 0
Guyger 0
deserves 0
her 0
day 0
in 0
court. 0

However, 0
as 0
far 0
as 0
her 0
job 0
with 0
the 0
department 0
is 0
concerned, 0
she 0
has 0
already 0
proven 0
that 0
she 0
is 0
no 0
longer 0
fit 0
for 0
duty, 0
ever 0
again. 0

WFAA 0
asked 0
the 0
Dallas 0
Police 0
Department 0
for 0
the 0
laws 0
she 0
cited 0
claiming 0
that 0
she 0
can’t 0
fire 0
Guyger, 0
but 0
they 0
did 0
not 0
provide 0
them. 0

The 0
department 0
did 0
respond 0
about 0
the 0
general 0
order 0
mentioned 0
by 0
WFAA, 0
however, 0
saying, 0
“General 0
order 0
508 0
refers 0
to 0
the 0
Police 0
Chief’s 0
ability 0
to 0
circumvent 0
the 0
formal 0
disciplinary 0
procedures 0
not 0
the 0
investigative 0
process.” 0

Exactly 0
what 0
“investigative 0
process” 0
needs 0
to 0
happen 0
before 0
they 0
can 0
fire 0
her 0
remains 0
unclear 0
as 0
this 0
public 0
servant 0
admitted 0
to 0
killing 0
an 0
innocent 1
man 0
in 0
his 0
own 0
home. 0

At 0
the 0
very 0
least, 0
she 0
should 0
be 0
fired 0
for 0
this. 0

But 0
then 0
again, 0
as 0
we’ve 0
reported 0
already 0
this 0
week, 0
Amber 0
Guyger 0
is 0
subject 0
to 0
a 0
different 0
set 0
of 0
rules 0
than 0
common 0
citizens, 0
which 0
apparently 0
includes 0
keeping 0
a 0
paycheck 0
after 0
admitting 0
to 0
killing 0
an 0
unarmed, 0
innocent, 1
pillar 1
of 1
society, 1
Botham 0
Jean. 0
