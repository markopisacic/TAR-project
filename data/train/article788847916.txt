“I 0 361 16
can’t 0 361 16

that 0 361 16
because 0 361 16
there 0 361 16

said 0 361 17
Hall. 0 361 17

But 0 361 18
experts 0 361 18
say 0 361 18
this 0 361 18
is 0 361 18
not 0 361 18
true. 0 361 18

As 0 361 19
WFAA 0 361 19
reports, 0 361 19
Justin 0 361 19
Moore, 0 361 19
a 0 361 19
civil 0 361 19
rights 0 361 19
attorney 0 361 19
was 0 361 19
a 0 361 19
panelist 0 361 19
at 0 361 19
the 0 361 19
meeting 0 361 19
and 0 361 19
was 0 361 19
surprised 0 361 19
by 0 361 19
the 0 361 19
Chief’s 0 361 19
comments. 0 361 19

“I 0 361 20
was 0 361 20
completely 0 361 20
mystified, 0 361 20
and 0 361 20
I 0 361 20
really 0 361 20
didn’t 0 361 20
understand 0 361 20
where 0 361 20
it 0 361 20
came 0 361 20
from 0 361 20
last 0 361 20
night. 0 361 20

It 0 361 21
seemed 0 361 21
like 0 361 21
Chief 1 361 21
Hall 1 361 21
might 1 361 21
not 1 361 21
have 1 361 21
been 1 361 21
well 1 361 21
informed 1 361 21
on 1 361 21
the 1 361 21
law,” 1 361 21
said 0 361 21
Moore. 0 361 21

WFAA 0 361 22
went 0 361 22
further 0 361 22
and 0 361 22
noted 0 361 22
that 0 361 22
the 0 361 22
“the 0 361 22
Dallas 0 361 22
Police 0 361 22
Department 0 361 22
general 0 361 22
orders 0 361 22
do 0 361 22
allow 0 361 22
the 0 361 22
chief 0 361 22
to 0 361 22
take 0 361 22
action, 0 361 22
saying, 0 361 22
‘The 0 361 22
Chief 0 361 22
of 0 361 22
Police 0 361 22
may 0 361 22
circumvent 0 361 22
all 0 361 22
formal 0 361 22
disciplinary 0 361 22
procedures 0 361 22
to 0 361 22
render 0 361 22
an 0 361 22
immediate 0 361 22
decision 0 361 22
when 0 361 22
it 0 361 22
deems 0 361 22
it 0 361 22
necessary 0 361 22
to 0 361 22

the 0 361 22
integrity 0 361 22
of 0 361 22
the 0 361 22

Apparently, 0 361 23
this 0 361 23
“integrity” 0 361 23
is 0 361 23
not 0 361 23
worth 0 361 23
preserving 0 361 23
and 0 361 23
the 0 361 23
Dallas 0 361 23
police 0 361 23
are 0 361 23
going 0 361 23
out 0 361 23
of 0 361 23

to 0 361 23

cop 1 361 23
on 0 361 23
their 0 361 23
payroll. 0 361 23

As 0 361 24
WFAA 0 361 24
pointed 0 361 24
out, 0 361 24
lots 0 361 24
of 0 361 24
cops 0 361 24
across 0 361 24
the 0 361 24

been 0 361 24
fired 0 361 24
by 0 361 24
police 0 361 24
chiefs. 0 361 24

This 0 361 25
includes 0 361 25
cops 0 361 25
within 0 361 25
the 0 361 25
Dallas 0 361 25
police 0 361 25
department. 0 361 25

Amy 0 361 26
Wilburn, 0 361 26
a 0 361 26
former 0 361 26
Dallas 1 361 26
cop 1 361 26
shot 1 361 26
an 1 361 26
unarmed 1 361 26
teen 1 361 26
in 0 361 26
the 0 361 26
stomach 0 361 26
as 0 361 26
he 0 361 26
sat 0 361 26
down 0 361 26
with 0 361 26
his 0 361 26
hands 0 361 26
in 0 361 26
the 0 361 26
air 0 361 26
in 0 361 26
2013. 0 361 26

Days 0 361 27
later, 0 361 27
after 0 361 27
her 0 361 27
account 0 361 27
was 0 361 27
found 0 361 27
to 0 361 27
be 0 361 27
entirely 0 361 27
false, 0 361 27
she 0 361 27
was 0 361 27
fired 0 361 27
for 0 361 27
it. 0 361 27

Wilburn 0 361 28
became 0 361 28
the 0 361 28
first 0 361 28
cop 0 361 28
in 0 361 28
41 0 361 28
years 0 361 28
— 0 361 28
since 0 361 28
officer 1 361 28
Darrell 1 361 28
Cain 1 361 28
murdered 1 361 28
a 1 361 28
12-year-old 1 361 28
boy 1 361 28
in 0 361 28
the 0 361 28
back 0 361 28
of 0 361 28
his 0 361 28
squad 0 361 28
car 0 361 28
— 0 361 28
to 0 361 28
be 0 361 28
indicted 0 361 28
for 0 361 28
shooting 0 361 28
a 0 361 28
suspect. 0 361 28

Also 0 361 29
in 0 361 29
2013, 0 361 29
officer 1 361 29
Cardan 1 361 29
Spencer 1 361 29
shot 1 361 29
a 1 361 29
mentally 1 361 29
ill 1 361 29
man 1 361 29
in 0 361 29
his 0 361 29
driveway. 0 361 29

Days 0 361 30
later, 0 361 30
he 0 361 30
was 0 361 30
also 0 361 30
fired 0 361 30
after 0 361 30
surveillance 0 361 30
video 0 361 30
proved 0 361 30
he 0 361 30
was 0 361 30
lying 0 361 30
about 0 361 30
what 0 361 30
happened. 0 361 30

So 0 361 31
why 0 361 31
hasn’t 0 361 31
the 0 361 31
chief 0 361 31
fired 0 361 31
Gugyer, 0 361 31
who 0 361 31
has 0 361 31
actually 0 361 31
been 0 361 31
charged, 0 361 31
arrested, 0 361 31
and 0 361 31
admitted 0 361 31
to 0 361 31
killing 0 361 31
an 0 361 31
innocent 1 361 31
man? 0 361 31

Like 0 361 32
all 0 361 32
those 0 361 32
accused 0 361 32
of 0 361 32
a 0 361 32
crime, 0 361 32
Amber 0 361 32
Guyger 0 361 32
deserves 0 361 32
her 0 361 32
day 0 361 32
in 0 361 32
court. 0 361 32

However, 0 361 33
as 0 361 33
far 0 361 33
as 0 361 33
her 0 361 33
job 0 361 33
with 0 361 33
the 0 361 33
department 0 361 33
is 0 361 33
concerned, 0 361 33
she 0 361 33
has 0 361 33
already 0 361 33
proven 0 361 33
that 0 361 33
she 0 361 33
is 0 361 33
no 0 361 33
longer 0 361 33
fit 0 361 33
for 0 361 33
duty, 0 361 33
ever 0 361 33
again. 0 361 33

WFAA 0 361 34
asked 0 361 34
the 0 361 34
Dallas 0 361 34
Police 0 361 34
Department 0 361 34
for 0 361 34
the 0 361 34
laws 0 361 34
she 0 361 34
cited 0 361 34
claiming 0 361 34
that 0 361 34
she 0 361 34
can’t 0 361 34
fire 0 361 34
Guyger, 0 361 34
but 0 361 34
they 0 361 34
did 0 361 34
not 0 361 34
provide 0 361 34
them. 0 361 34

The 0 361 35
department 0 361 35
did 0 361 35
respond 0 361 35
about 0 361 35
the 0 361 35
general 0 361 35
order 0 361 35
mentioned 0 361 35
by 0 361 35
WFAA, 0 361 35
however, 0 361 35
saying, 0 361 35
“General 0 361 35

refers 0 361 35
to 0 361 35

the 0 361 35
investigative 0 361 35
process.” 0 361 35

Exactly 0 361 36
what 0 361 36
“investigative 0 361 36
process” 0 361 36
needs 0 361 36
to 0 361 36
happen 0 361 36
before 0 361 36
they 0 361 36
can 0 361 36
fire 0 361 36
her 0 361 36
remains 0 361 36
unclear 0 361 36
as 0 361 36
this 0 361 36
public 0 361 36
servant 0 361 36
admitted 0 361 36
to 0 361 36
killing 0 361 36
an 0 361 36
innocent 1 361 36
man 0 361 36
in 0 361 36
his 0 361 36
own 0 361 36
home. 0 361 36

At 0 361 37
the 0 361 37
very 0 361 37
least, 0 361 37
she 0 361 37
should 0 361 37
be 0 361 37
fired 0 361 37
for 0 361 37
this. 0 361 37

But 0 361 38
then 0 361 38
again, 0 361 38
as 0 361 38
we’ve 0 361 38
reported 0 361 38
already 0 361 38
this 0 361 38
week, 0 361 38
Amber 0 361 38
Guyger 0 361 38
is 0 361 38
subject 0 361 38
to 0 361 38
a 0 361 38
different 0 361 38
set 0 361 38
of 0 361 38
rules 0 361 38
than 0 361 38
common 0 361 38
citizens, 0 361 38
which 0 361 38
apparently 0 361 38
includes 0 361 38
keeping 0 361 38
a 0 361 38
paycheck 0 361 38
after 0 361 38
admitting 0 361 38
to 0 361 38
killing 0 361 38
an 0 361 38
unarmed, 0 361 38
innocent, 1 361 38
