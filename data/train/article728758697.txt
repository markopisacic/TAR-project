inflammatory 0 142 8
comments. 0 142 8

Like 0 142 9
this. 0 142 9

Farrakhan 1 142 10
had 1 142 10
praised 1 142 10
Hitler 1 142 10
and 1 142 10
declared 1 142 10
that 1 142 10
the 1 142 10
Jews, 1 142 10
"can't 1 142 10
say 1 142 10
'Never 1 142 10
Again' 1 142 10
to 1 142 10
God, 1 142 10
because 1 142 10
when 1 142 10
he 1 142 10
puts 1 142 10
you 1 142 10
in 1 142 10
the 1 142 10
ovens, 1 142 10
you're 1 142 10
there 1 142 10
forever.” 1 142 10

"Here 1 142 11
come 1 142 11
the 1 142 11
Jews. 1 142 11

They 1 142 12
don't 1 142 12
like 1 142 12
Farrakhan, 1 142 12
so 1 142 12
they 1 142 12
call 1 142 12
me 1 142 12
Hitler. 1 142 12

Well, 1 142 13
that's 1 142 13
a 1 142 13
good 1 142 13
name. 1 142 13

Hitler 1 142 14
was 1 142 14
a 1 142 14
very 1 142 14
great 1 142 14
man." 1 142 14

Would 1 142 15
a 1 142 15
Republican 1 142 15
get 1 142 15
a 1 142 15
pass 1 142 15
on 1 142 15
meeting 1 142 15
with 1 142 15
a 1 142 15

hate 1 142 15
group 1 142 15
leader? 1 142 15

Obviously 1 142 16
not. 1 142 16

Obama's 0 142 17
meeting 0 142 17
with 0 142 17
Farrakhan 0 142 17
was 0 142 17
part 0 142 17
of 0 142 17
a 0 142 17
CBC 0 142 17

The 0 142 18

yet 0 142 18
to 0 142 18
apologize 0 142 18
for 0 142 18
it. 0 142 18

Don't 1 142 19
expect 1 142 19
it 1 142 19
to 1 142 19
condemn 1 142 19
Rep. 1 142 19
Davis' 1 142 19
comments. 1 142 19

He 1 142 20
was 1 142 20
just 1 142 20
saying 1 142 20
what 1 142 20
most 1 142 20
of 1 142 20
them 1 142 20
think. 1 142 20

The 1 142 21
media 1 142 21
is 1 142 21
happy 1 142 21
to 1 142 21
talk 1 142 21
about 1 142 21
anti-Semitism. 1 142 21

It 0 142 21
